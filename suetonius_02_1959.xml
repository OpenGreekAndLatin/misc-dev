       a stated day, which the cities of Gaul were to observe with prayers and sacrifices. The
       senate, in addition to many other honours, voted him a marble arch adorned with trophies on
       the Appian Way, and the surname Germanicus for himself and his descendants. It is the general
       belief that he was as eager for glory as he was democratic <note type="footnote" n="e">e See

       personal risk, and he made no secret of his intention of restoring the old-time form of
       government, whenever he should have the power. It is because of this, I think, that some have
       made bold to write that he was an object of suspicion to Augustus; that the emperor recalled
       him from his province, and when he did not obey at once, took him off by poison. This </p>

      <p> I have mentioned, rather not to pass it by, than that I think it true or even probable;
       for as a matter of fact Augustus loved him so dearly while he lived that he always named him
       joint-heir along with his sons, as he once declared in the senate, and when he was dead, he
       eulogized him warmly before the people, praying the gods to make his Caesars <note
        type="footnote" n="a">a C and L. Caesar, see Tib, xxiii. and Index.</note> like Drusus, and
       to grant him, when his time came, as glorious a death as they had given that hero. And not
       content with carving a laudatory inscription on his tomb in verses of his own composition,
       Augustus also wrote a memoir of his life in prose. Drusus had several children by the younger
       Antonia, but was survived by only three, Germanicus, Livilla, and Claudius. <milestone

       received the name of Tiberius Claudius Drusus. Later, on the adoption of his elder brother
       into the Julian family, he took the surname Germanicus. He lost his father when he was still
       an infant, and throughout almost the whole course of his childhood and youth he suffered so
       severely from various obstinate disorders that the vigour of both his mind and his body was
       dulled, and even when he reached the proper age he was not thought capable of any public or
       private business. For a long time, even after he reached the age of independence,<note

       because of his weak health that contrary to all precedent he wore a cloak when he presided at
       the gladiatorial games which he and his brother gave in honour of their father; and on the
       day when he assumed the gown of manhood he was taken in a litter to the Capitol about
       midnight without the usual escort. <note type="footnote" n="a">a Of relatives and

       his earliest youth, and even published frequent specimens of his attainments in each line.
       But even so he could not attain any public position or inspire more favourable hopes of his
       future. His mother Antonia often called him "a monster of a man, not finished but merely
       begun by Dame Nature "; and if she accused anyone of dulness, she used to say that he was “a
       bigger fool than her son Claudius." His grandmother Augusta always treated him with the
       utmost contempt, very rarely speaking to him; and when she admonished him, she did so in
       short, harsh letters, or through messengers. When his sister Livilla heard that he would one
       day be emperor, she openly and loudly prayed that the Roman people might be spared so cruel
       and undeserved a fortune. Finally to make it clearer what opinions, favourable and otherwise,
       his great uncle Augustus had of him, I have appended extracts from Ins own letters:

       advanced through the same grades and steps through which his brother has been advanced? But
       if we realize that he is wanting and defective in soundness of body and mind, we must not
       furnish the means of ridiculing both him and us to a public which is wont to scoff at and
       deride such things. Surely we shall always be in a stew, if we deliberate about each separate
       occasion and do not make up our minds in advance whether we think he can hold public offices
       or not. However, as to the matters about which you ask my present advice, I do not object to
       his having charge of the banquet of the priests at the games of Mars, if he will allow
       himself to be advised by his kinsman the son of Silvanus, so as not to do anything to make
       himself conspicuous or ridiculous. That he should view the games in the Circus from the
       Imperial box <note type="footnote" n="b">b See note on Aug. xlv. 1.</note> does not meet with
       my approval; for he will be conspicuous if exposed to full view in the front of the
       auditorium. I am opposed to his going to the Alban Mount or being in Rome on the days of the
       Latin festival; for why should he not be made prefect of the city, if he is able to attend
       his brother to the Mount? You have my views, my dear Livia, to wit that I desire that

       for improper conduct towards women, but on a false charge tramped up by unscrupulous enemies,

       Palace beside the civic crown, as a sign that he had crossed and, as it were, subdued the
       Ocean. His wife Messalina followed his chariot in a carriage, as did also those who had won

       founts of the Claudian aqueduct, one of which is called Caeruleus and the other Curtius and
       Albudignus, and at the same time the spring of the new Anio, distributing them into many

       gain as of glory, inasmuch as there were some who agreed to drain it at their own cost,
       provided the land that was uncovered be given to them. He finished the outlet, which was
       three miles in length, partly by levelling and partly by tunnelling a mountain, a work of

       defence; also Gnaeus Pompeius, the husband of his elder daughter, and Lucius Silanus who was
       betrothed to his younger one. Of these Pompey was stabbed in the embraces of a favourite
       youth, while Silanus was compelled to abdicate his praetorship four days before the Kalends
       of January and to take his own life at the beginning of the year, the very day of the
       marriage of Claudius and Agrippina. He inflicted the death penalty on thirty-five senators
       and more than three hundred Roman knights with such easy indifference, that when a centurion
       in reporting the death of an ex-consul said that his order had been carried out, he replied
       that he had given no order; but he nevertheless approved the act, since his freedmen declared
       that the soldiers had done their duty in hastening to avenge their emperor without
       instructions. But it is beyond all belief, that at the marriage which Messalina had
       contracted with her paramour Silius he signed the contract for the dowry with his own hand,
       being induced to do so on the ground that the marriage was a feigned one, designed to avert

       lances and having his soldiers wait upon him in place of the servants; and he never visited a
       man who was ill without having the patient's room examined beforehand and his pillows and
       bed-clothing felt over and shaken out. Afterwards he even subjected those who came to pay
       their morning calls to search, sparing none the strictest examination. Indeed, it was not
       until late, and then reluctantly, that he gave up having women and young boys and girls
       grossly mishandled, and the cases for pens and styles taken from every man s attendant or
       scribe. When Camillus began his revolution, he felt sure that Claudius could be intimidated
       without resorting to war; and in fact when he ordered the emperor in an insulting,
       threatening, and impudent letter to give up his throne and betake himself to a life of
       privacy and retirement, Claudius called together the leading men and asked their advice about

       declaring that he had dreamed that Appius had made an attack on the emperor. Then Messalina,
       with assumed surprise, declared that she had had the same dream for several successive

       terms, his μετεωρία and ἀβλεψία. When he had put Messalina to death, he asked shortly after
       taking his place at the table why the empress did not come. He caused many of those whom he
       had condemned to death to be summoned the very next day to consult with him or game with him,
       and sent a messenger to upbraid them for sleepy-heads when they delayed to appear. When he
       was planning his unlawful marriage with Agrippina, in every speech that he made he constantly
       called her his daughter and nursling, born and brought up in his arms. Just before his
       adoption of Nero, as if it were not bad enough to adopt a stepson when he had a grownup son
       of his own, he publicly declared more than once that no one had ever been taken into the
       Claudian family by adoption. <milestone unit="section" n="40"/>XL. In short, he often showed
       such heedlessness in word and act that one would suppose that he did not know or care to
       whom, with whom, when, or where lie was speaking. When a debate was going on about the
       butchers and vintners, he cried out in the House: " Now, pray, who can live without a
       snack,'' and then went on to describe the abundance of the old taverns to which he himself
       used to go for wine in earlier days. He gave us one of his reasons for supporting a candidate
       for the quaestorship, that the man's father had once given him cold water when he was ill and
       needed it. Once when a witness had been brought before the senate, he said: “This </p>

       according to the principles of Augustus, and he let slip no opportunity for acts of
       generosity and mercy, or even for displaying his affability. The more oppressive sources of
       revenue he either abolished or moderated. He reduced the rewards paid to informers against
       violators of the Papian law <note type="footnote" n="a">a See Claud. xix.</note> to one

       discuss any matter with all his advisers in a body, but made each of them give his opinion in
       written form; these he read silently and in private and then gave a verdict according to his
       own inclination, as if it were the view of the majority. For a long time he would not admit
       the sons of freedmen to the senate and he refused office to those who had been admitted by

       mother-of-pearl. There were dining-rooms with fretted ceilings of ivory, whose panels could
       turn and shower down flowers and were fitted with pipes for sprinkling the guests with
       perfumes. The main banquet hall was circular and constantly revolved day and night, like the

       say nothing more in the way of approval than that he was at last beginning to be housed like
       a human being. He also began a pool, extending from Misenum to the lake of Avernus, roofed
       over and enclosed in colonnades, into which he planned to turn all the hot springs in every
       part of Baiae; a canal from Avernus all the way to Ostia, to enable the journey to be made by
       ship yet not by sea; its length was to be a hundred and sixty miles and its breadth
       sufficient to allow ships with five banks of oars to pass each other. For the execution of
       these projects he had given orders that the prisoners all over the empire should be
       transported to Italy, and that those who were convicted even of capital crimes should be
       punished in no other way than by sentence to this work. </p>

      <p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>I. THE race of the Caesars ended with Nero. <note
        type="footnote" n="a">a Nero was the last who bore the name because of connection with the
        family of Augustus; after him it became a designation of rank.</note> That this would be so
       was shown by many portents and especially by two very significant ones. Years before, as
       Livia was returning to her estate near Veii, immediately after her marriage with Augustus, an
       eagle <note type="margin">38 B.C.</note> which flew by dropped into her lap a white hen,
       holding in its beak a sprig of laurel, just as the eagle had carried it off. Livia resolved
       to rear the fowl and plant the sprig, whereupon such a great brood of chickens was hatched
       that to this day the villa is called Ad Gallinas,<note type="footnote" n="b">b "The Hen
        Roost."</note> and such a grove of laurel sprang up, that the Caesars gathered their laurels
       from it when they were going to celebrate triumphs. Moreover it was the habit of those who
       triumphed to plant other branches <note type="footnote" n="c">c Those which they carried in
        their triumph, according to Pliny, N. H. 15. 136 f.</note> at once in that same place, and
       it was observed that just before the death of each of them the tree which he had planted
       withered. Now in Nero's last year the whole grove died from the root up, as well as all the
       hens. Furthermore, when shortly afterwards the temple of the Caesars <note type="footnote"
        n="d">d Perhaps the Templum Divi Augusti, Top. Dict. Anc. R., p. 63.</note> was struck by
       lightning, the heads fell from all the statues at the same time, and his sceptre, too, was
       dashed from the hand of Augustus. </p>

       brief account of his immediate family. <note type="footnote" n="b">b That is, of those of the
        Sulpicii who bore the surname Galba.</note> It is uncertain why the first of the Sulpicii
       who bore the surname Galba assumed the name, and whence it was derived. Some think that it
       was because after having for a long time unsuccessfully besieged a town in Spain, he at last
       set fire to it by torches smeared with galbanum <note type="footnote" n="c">c The gum of a
        Syrian plant; see Pliny, N. H. 12. 126</note>; others because during a long illness he made
       constant use of galbeum, that is to say of remedies wrapped in wool; still others, because he
       was a very fat man, such as the Gauls term galba, or because he was, on the contrary, as
       slender as the insects called galbae, which breed in oak trees. The family acquired
       distinction from Servius Galba, <note type="margin">145 B.C.</note> who became consul and was
       decidedly the most eloquent speaker of his time. This man, they say, was the cause of the war
       with Viriathus, because <note type="margin">150-156 B.C.</note> while governing Spain as
       propraetor, he treacherously massacred thirty thousand of the Lusitanians. His grandson had

       the father of the emperor Galba. The former, who was more eminent for his learning than for
       his rank—for he did not advance beyond the grade of praetor—published a voluminous and
       painstaking history. The father attained the consulship, and although he <note n="marg">22
        A.D.</note> was short of stature and even hunchbacked, besides being only an indifferent
       speaker, was an industrious pleader at the bar. He married Mummia Achaica, the granddaughter
       of Catulus and great-granddaughter of Lucius Mummius who destroyed Corinth; and later Livia
       Ocellina, a very rich and beautiful woman, who however is thought to have sought marriage
       with him because of his high rank, and the more eagerly when, in response to her frequent
       advances, he took off his robe in private and showed her his deformity, so as not to seem to
       deceive her by concealing it. By Achaica he had two sons, Gaius and Servius. Gaius, who was
       the elder, left Rome after squandering the greater part of his estate, and committed suicide
       because Tiberius would not allow him to take part in the allotment of the provinces in his
       year. <note type="footnote" n="b">b That is, after his consulship. Tiberius doubtless
        suspected him of a desire to enrich himself at the expense of the provincials; cf. Tib.

       of his age, the emperor pinched his cheek and said in Greek: " Thou too, child, wilt have a
       nibble at this power of mine." Tiberius too, when he heard that Galba was destined to be
       emperor, but in his old age, said: “ Well, let him live then, since that does not concern
       me.'' Again, when Galba's grandfather was busy with a sacrifice for a stroke of
        lightning,<note type="footnote" n="a">a The usual procedure, to avert the evil omen.</note>
       and an eagle snatched the intestines from his hand and carried them to an oak full of acorns,
       the prediction was made that the highest dignity would come to the family, but late;
       whereupon he said with a laugh: " Very likely, when a mule has a foal. <note type="footnote"
        n="b">b Proverbial for “never," like the Greek Kalends (Aug. lxxxvii. 1).</note>" Afterwards
       when Galba was beginning his revolt, nothing gave him so much encouragement as the foaling of
       a mule, and while the rest were horrified and looked on it as an unfavourable omen, he alone
       regarded it as most propitious, remembering the sacrifice and his grandfather s saying. When
       he assumed the gown of manhood, he dreamt that Fortune said that she was tired of standing
       before his door, and that unless she were quickly admitted, she would fall a prey to the
       first comer. When he awoke, opening the door of the hall, he found close by the threshold a
       bronze statue of Fortune more than a cubit high. This he carried in his arms to Tusculum,
       where he usually spent the summer, and consecrated it in a room of his house; and from that
       time on he honoured it with monthly sacrifices and a yearly vigil. Even before he reached

       before a company of matrons and went so far as to slap her. He showed marked respect to Livia
       Augusta, to whose favour he owed great influence during her lifetime and by whose last will
       he almost became a rich man; for he had the largest bequest among her legatees, one of fifty
       million sesterces. But because the sum was designated in figures and not written out in

       as a sign of a change of rulers and of the succession of an old man to a young one; that is

       At first he was vigorous and energetic and even over severe in punishing offences; for he cut
       off the hands of a money-lender who carried on his business dishonestly and nailed them to
       his counter; crucified a man for poisoning his ward, whose property he was to inherit in case
       of his death; and when the man invoked the law and declared that he was a Roman citizen,
       Galba, pretending to lighten his punishment by some consolation and honour, ordered that a
       cross much higher than the rest and painted white be set up, and the man transferred to it.
       But he gradually changed to sloth and inaction, so as to give Nero no cause for jealousy, and
       as he used to say himself, because no one could be forced to render an account for doing
       nothing. As lie was holding the assizes at New Carthage, he learned of the rebellion of the
       Gallic provinces through an urgent appeal for help from the governor of Aquitania; then came
       letters from Vindex, calling upon him to make himself the liberator and leader of mankind. So
       without much hesitation he accepted the proposal, led by fear as well as by hope. For he had
       intercepted despatches ordering his own death, which had been secretly sent by Nero to his

       death divers distinguished men of both orders on trivial suspicions without a trial. He
       rarely granted Roman citizenship, and the privileges of threefold paternity <note

       those only for a fixed and limited time. When the jurors petitioned that a sixth division be
       added to their number, he not only refused, but even deprived them of the privilege granted
       by Claudius, <note type="footnote" n="b">b See Claud. xxiii. 1, and the note.</note> of not
       being summoned for court duty in winter and at the beginning of the year. <milestone

       senators and knights to a period of two years, and to give them only to such as did not wish
       them and declined them. <note type="footnote" n="c">c These offices were numerous and varied.
        Since his apparent purpose was to check ambition and avarice, the senatorial offices
        referred to were probably military commands and governorships, and the equestrian,
        procuratorships; see note on Claud. xxxiv. 1.</note> He had all the grants of Nero revoked,
       allowing only a tenth part to be retained; and he exacted repayment with the help of fifty
       Roman knights, stipulating that even if the actors and athletes had sold anything that had
       formerly been given them, it should be taken away from the purchasers, in case the recipient
       had spent the money and could not repay it. On the other hand, there was nothing that he did
       not allow his friends and freedmen to sell at a price or bestow as a favour, taxes and
       freedom from taxation, the punishment of the guiltless and impunity for the guilty. Nay more,
       when the Roman people called for the punishment of Halotus and Tigellinus, the most utterly
       abandoned of all Nero s creatures, not content with saving their lives, he honoured Halotus

       Galba in his absence, so far from keeping the promise, he declared more than once that it was
       his habit to levy troops, not buy them; and on this account he embittered the soldiers all
       over the empire. The praetorians he filled besides with both fear and indignation by
       discharging many of them from time to time as under suspicion of being partisans of
       Nymphidius. <note type="footnote" n="b">b See chap. xi.</note> But loudest of all was the
       grumbling of the army in Upper Germany, because it was defrauded of the reward for its
       services against the Gauls and Vindex. Hence they were the first to venture on mutiny,
       refusing on the Kalends of January to swear allegiance to anyone save the senate, and at once
       resolving to send a deputation to the praetorians with the following message: that the
       emperor created in Spain did not suit them and the Guard must choose one who would be
       acceptable to all the armies. <milestone unit="section" n="17"/>XVII. When this was reported
       to Galba, thinking that it was not so much his age as his lack of children that was
       criticised, he picked out Piso Frugi Licinianus from the midst of the throng at one of his
       morning receptions, a young man of noble birth and high character, who had long been one of
       his special favourites and always named in his will as heir to his property and his name.
       Calling him son, he led him to the praetorian camp and adopted him before the assembled

       dismounted, one of his guards, pushed forward by the crowd, almost wounded him with his
       lance. Again, as he entered the city, and later the Palace, he was met by a shock of
       earthquake and a sound like the lowing of kine. There followed even clearer signs. He had set
       apart from all the treasure a necklace fashioned of pearls and precious stones, for the
       adornment of his image of Fortune at Tusculum. <note type="footnote" n="b">b See chap. iv.
        3.</note> This on a sudden impulse he consecrated to the Capitoline Venus, thinking it
       worthy of a more august position. The next night Fortune appeared to him in his dreams,
       complaining of being robbed of the gift intended for her and threatening in her turn to take
       away what she had bestowed. When Galba hastened in terror to Tusculum at daybreak, to offer
       expiatory sacrifices because of the dream, and sent on men to make preparations for the
       ceremony, he found on the altar nothing but warm ashes and beside it an old man dressed in

       high hopes of imperial power, because of the state of the times, but still more because of a
       declaration of the astrologer Seleucus. <note type="footnote" n="a">a Tacitus and Plutarch

       and made the further promise, that he would soon become emperor as well. Accordingly Otho let
       slip no opportunity for flattery or attention to anyone. Whenever he entertained the prince
       at dinner, he gave a gold piece to each man of the cohort on guard, and put all the soldiers
       under obligation in one form or another. Chosen arbiter by a man who was at law with his
       neighbour about a part of his estate, he bought the whole property and presented it to him.

       dignity and proposed to become his son-in-law. But when it became clear that war was
       inevitable, and the generals and troops which Vitellius had sent in advance were already

       attempted to stop them, and killing others, just as they were, all blood-stained, they burst
       right into the dining-room, demanding to know where the emperor was; and they could not be
       quieted until they had seen him. <note type="footnote" n="d">d This difficult passage is
        obscure because of its brevity and perhaps through corruption of the text. The same story is

        According to Suetonius the arms were sent from the praetorian camp to Ostia, to fit out the
        (seventeenth) cohort, and the riot started in the praetorian camp; the account of Tacitus
        seems to imply that it was the soldiers from Ostia (joined by the praetorians) that burst

       proper course was to protract the war, since the enemy were hard pressed by hunger and by the
       narrowness of their quarters, he decided to fight a decisive battle as soon as possible,
       either because he could not endure the continued worry and hoped that the war could be ended

       who clamoured for the fight. He himself did not take part in any of the battles, but remained
       behind at Brixellum. He was victorious in three contests, but they were of little moment: in

       that he was led to hold his life cheap at that time by the example of a common soldier. This

      <p> flatterers and detractors of the emperor, were it not for a difference of opinion about
       the standing of the family at a considerably earlier date. We have a book of Quintus Elogius
       addressed to Quintus Vitellius, quaestor of the Deified Augustus, in which it is written that
       the Vitellii were sprung from Faunus, king of the Aborigines, and Vitellia, who was
       worshipped as a goddess in many places; and that they ruled in all Latium. That the surviving
       members of the family moved from the Sabine district to Rome and were enrolled among the
       patricians. That traces of this stock endured long afterwards in the Vitellian Road, running
       from the Janiculum all the way to the sea, as well as in a colony of the same name, which in
       ancient days the family had asked the privileged of defending against the Aequicoli with
       troops raised from their own line. That when afterwards a force was sent into Apulia at the
       time of the Samnite war, some of the Vitellii settled at Nuceria, and that after a long time
       their descendants returned to the city and resumed their place in the senatorial order.
        <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>II. On the other hand several have written that the founder

       confiscated estates and the profession of informer, married a common strumpet, daughter of
       one Antiochus who kept «a bakery, and became the father of a Roman knight. But this

       of an easy-going and lavish disposition. This earlier good opinion Vitellius had also
       strengthened by recent acts, for throughout the march he kissed even the common soldiers whom
       he met, and at the posthouses and inns he was unusually affable to the mule drivers and

       water, for which the man had called when ill of a fever. Besides he spared hardly one of the
       money-lenders, contractors, and tax-gatherers who had ever demanded of him the payment of a
       debt at Rome or of a toll on a journey. When one of these had been handed over for execution
       just as he was paying his morning call and at once recalled, as all were praising the
       emperor's mercy, Vitellius gave orders to have him killed in his presence, saying that he
       wished to feast his eyes. In another case he had two sons who attempted to intercede for
       their father put to death with him. A Roman knight also, who cried as he was being taken off
       to execution, " You are my heir," he compelled to show his will; and reading that one of the
       man's freedmen was put down as joint-heir with himself, he ordered the death both of the

       obtained the broad stripe against his father's wish, and to have been severely rebuked in
       consequence. On the tour through Greece, among the companions of Nero,<note type="footnote"
        n="a">a See Nero, xxii. ff.</note> he bitterly offended the emperor by either going out
       often while Nero was singing, or falling asleep, if he remained. Being in consequence
       banished, not only from intimacy with the emperor but even from his public receptions, he
       withdrew to a little out-of-the-way town, until a province and an army were offered him while
       he was in hiding and in tear of his life. There had spread over all the Orient an old and
       established belief, that it was fated at that time for men coming from Judaea to rule the
       world. This prediction, referring to the emperor of Rome, as afterwards appeared from the
       event, the people of Judaea took to themselves; accordingly they revolted and after killing
       their governor, they routed the consular ruler of Syria as well, when he came to the rescue,
       and took one of his eagles. Since to put down this rebellion required a considerable army
       with a leader of no little enterprise, yet one to whom so great power could be entrusted
       without risk, Vespasian was chosen for the task, both as a man of tried energy and as one in
       no wise to be feared because of the obscurity of his family and name. Therefore there were
       added to the forces in Judaea two legions with eight divisions of cavalry and ten cohorts.

       shield. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>V. While Otho and Vitellius were fighting for the
       throne after the death of Nero and Galba, he began to cherish the hope of imperial dignity,
       which he had long since conceived because of the following portents. On the suburban estate
       of the Flavii an old oak tree, which was sacred to Mars, on each of the three occasions when
       Vespasia was delivered suddenly put forth a branch from its trunk, obvious indications of the
       destiny of each child. The first was slender and quickly withered, and so too the girl that
       was born died within the year; the second was very strong and long and portended great
       success, but the third was the image of a tree. Therefore their father Sabinus, so they say,
       being further encouraged by an inspection of victims, announced to his mother that a grandson
       had been born to her who would be a Caesar. But she only laughed, marvelling that her son
       should already be in his dotage, while she was still of strong mind. Later, when Vespasian
       was aedile, Gaius Caesar, incensed at his neglect of his duty of cleaning the streets,
       ordered that he be covered with mud, which the soldiers accordingly heaped into the bosom of
       his purple-bordered toga; this some interpreted as an omen that one day in some civil
       commotion his country, trampled under foot and forsaken, would come under his protection and

       unknown to him and at a distance. Two thousand soldiers of the three legions that made up the

       as Aquileia, because they did not believe the report. There, taking advantage of the lawless
       state of the times, they indulged in every kind of pillage; then, fearing that if they went
       back, they would have to give an account and suffer punishment, they took it into their heads
       to select and appoint an emperor, saying that they were just as good as the Spanish army
       which had appointed Galba, or the praetorian guard which had elected Otho, or the German army
       which had chosen Vitellius. Accordingly the names of all the consular governors who were
       serving anywhere were taken up, and since objection was made to the rest for one reason or
       another, while some members of the third legion, which had been transferred from Syria to
       Moesia just before the death of Nero, highly commended Vespasian, they unanimously agreed on
       him and forthwith inscribed his name on all their banners. At the time, however, the movement

       letters came with the news that Vitellius had been routed at Cremona and the emperor himself

       was an unexpected and still new-made emperor; but these also were given him. A man of the
       people who was blind, and another who was lame, came to him together as he sat on the

       the god declared that Vespasian would restore the eyes, if he would spit upon them, and give
       strength to the leg, if he would deign to touch it with his heel. Though he had hardly any
       faith that this could possibly succeed, and therefore shrank even from making the attempt, he
       was at last prevailed upon by his friends and tried both things in public before a large
       crowd; and with success. At this same time, by the direction of certain soothsayers, some

       from being led by any suspicion or fear to cause anyone's death, that when his friends warned

       and taught the same subjects by the same masters. At that time, so they say, a physiognomist
       was brought in by Narcissus, the freedman of Claudius, to examine Britannicus and declared
       most positively that he would never become emperor; but that Titus, who was standing near by

       refused to regard favours granted by previous emperors as valid, unless they had themselves
       conferred the same ones on the same individuals, Titus was the first to ratify them all in a
       single edict, without allowing himself to be asked. Moreover, in the case of other requests
       made of him, it was his fixed rule not to let anyone go away without hope. Even when his
       household officials warned him that he was promising more than he could perform, he said that
       it was not right for anyone to go away sorrowful from an interview with his emperor. On
       another occasion, remembering at dinner that he had done nothing for anybody all that day, he
       gave utterance to that memorable and praiseworthy remark; “Friends, I have lost a day.” </p>

       illness, when Domitian ordered that he be left for dead, before he had actually drawn his
       last breath. And after his death he bestowed no honour upon him, save that of deification,

       edicts. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>III. At the beginning of his reign he used to spend
       hours in seclusion every day, doing nothing but catch flies and stab them with a
       keenly-sharpened stylus. Consequently when someone once asked whether anyone was in there
       with Caesar, Vibius Crispus made the witty reply: "Not even a fly." Then he saluted his wife
       Domitia as Augusta. He had had a son by her in his second consulship, and in the following
       year a daughter; he divorced her because of her love for the actor Paris, but could not bear
       the separation and soon took her back, alleging that the people demanded it. In his

       reason being given an audience, he stabbed the emperor in the groin as he was reading a paper
       which the assassin handed him, and stood in a state of amazement. As the wounded prince
       attempted to resist, he was slain with seven wounds by Clodianus, a subaltern, Maximus, a
       freedman of Parthenius, Satur, decurion of the chamberlains, and a gladiator from the

       servants; but he found nothing at the head of the bed save the hilt, and besides all the
       doors were closed. Meanwhile the emperor grappled with Stephanus and bore him to the ground,

       with common prostitutes. After persistently refusing his niece, who was offered him in

     <p>THE manuscripts of the Dialogus and Agricola of Tacitus contain also a treatise “On
      Grammarians and Rhetoricians,” attributed to Suetonius. This work was used by Gellius (Nod.
      Att. 15. 11) and by Hieronymus, but after the latter s day was lost for many centuries. About
      the middle of the fifteenth century,<app n="1">
       <note>1 The date is variously given: 1455, Teuffel, Gesch. d. rüm. Lit. 6; 1457-8, Gudeman,

      </app> in the course of a journey through Germany and Denmark, Enoch of Ascoli <app n="2">
       <note>2 Enoch's discovery of this manuscript has been doubted by some, but is now accepted by
        most scholars.</note>
      </app> found the two works of Tacitus and the treatise on Grammarians and Rhetoricians,
      apparently at Hersfeld and in a single codex, and brought them to Italy. This codex is now
       lost,<app n="3">
       <note>3 Except for one quaternio, now at Esinus (Josi).</note>
      </app> but some eighteen copies of the De Grammaticis et Rhetoribus are in existence, all
      belonging to the fifteenth century, which show remarkable differences in reading, considering
      that they are derived from a single archetype, and are separated from it by so short a time.
      These manuscripts, not all of which have been collated, fall into two classes, distinguished
      from each other by the presence or absence of the index of names at the beginning of the
      treatise. </p>
     <pb n="389"/>
     <p> Roth in his edition of 1858 asserted the superiority of the former class, and Ihm is
      inclined to agree with him,<app n="1">
       <note>1 Rhein. Museum. 61 (1906), p. 543.</note>
      </app> For a list of the better codices with their sigla see p. 395. Owing to the late date of
      all the manuscripts, the early printed editions are of some value in the criticism of the
      text; see the Bibliographical Note, p. 394. The work begins with an index, containing a list
      of the grammarians and rhetoricians who are to be discussed, which, as has been said, is
      omitted by some of the manuscripts. This is followed by an introduction on the origin and
      development of grammatical studies at Rome, and the connection of grammar with rhetoric, after
      which the individual representatives of the subject are treated. The part devoted to
      rhetoricians also begins with an introduction on the history of the study, but the work comes
      to an end after dealing with five of the fifteen persons named in the index. It has been
      generally recognized that this treatise on "Grammarians and Rhetoricians'' formed part of a
      larger work by Suetonius, entitled De Viris Illustrious, which treated of Romans who were
      eminent in the field of literature. <app n="2">
       <note>2 See Volume I, p. xi.</note>
      </app> It seems to have consisted of five divisions, devoted respectively to Poets, Orators,
      Historians, Philosophers, and Grammarians and Rhetoricians under one head. The order of the
      various divisions, or books, cannot be determined. <app n="3">
       <note>3 Hieronymus used the De Viris Illustrious of Suetonius as his model in the composition
        of a work of the same title, devoted to the worthies of the Church, as well as in his
        translation and enlargement of the " Chronicle " of Eusebius. From the latter numerous
        fragments of the De Viris Illustribus of Suetonius have been recovered, and the general plan
        of bis work made out.</note>
      </app></p>
     <pb n="390"/>
     <p> To judge from the personages treated by Suetonius and those whom he omits, the De Viris
      Illustribus appears to have been written between 106 and 113. It was therefore his earliest
      work, and is in all probability the one to which Pliny refers.<app n="1">
       <note>1 See Volume I, p. x, footnote 1.</note>
      </app> As was the case with the Lives of the Caesars, he apparently set as his limit the close
      of the reign of Domitian, so that Juvenal, Tacitus and the younger Pliny were not included.
      While the greater part of the De Vitis Illustribus has been lost, some passages of
      considerable length, in addition to the “Grammarians and Rhetoricians," have been recovered
      from various sources. These consist of Lives of various Roman writers, prefixed to their works
      by way of introduction. <app n="2">
       <note>2 For the manuscripts and their sigla see pp. 450 and 451.</note>
      </app> None of these has come down to us in its original form, and they differ greatly in the
      amount of abridgment or of interpolation to which they have been subjected. Those which may
      properly be included in an edition of Suetonius are the following. From the book on Poets (De
      Poetis), to which an index of thirty-three names has been compiled from the references in
       Hieronymus,<app n="3">
       <note>3 This is given on p. 450.</note>
      </app> we have a Life of Terence, preserved in the Commentary of Aelius Donatus, of the fourth
      century, and ascribed by </p>
     <pb n="391"/>
     <p> him to Suetonius. A Life of Horace, which is found in some of the manuscripts, is not
      directly attributed to Suetonius, but is believed to be his because of the occurrence in it of
      certain statements which are credited to Suetonius by the scholiasts. <app n="1">
       <note>1. See for example Porphyrio on Epist. 2. 1. 1.</note>
      </app> A very fragmentary Life of Lucan is assigned to Suetonius also on internal evidence.
      With regard to the ultimate authorship of these three Lives there is little, if any,
      difference of opinion. With regard to three others the agreement is not so general, but they
      are assigned to Suetonius by some scholars. These are the Life of Vergil, in Donatus
      Commentary, where it is followed by an introduction to the Bucolics from Donatus own hand; a
      Life of Tibullus, greatly abridged, and a Lite of Persius. The last is directly attributed to
      Valerius Probus, but in spite of this is believed by many to be Suetonian. <app n="2">
       <note>2 See especially G. Körtge, In Suet, de Viris Ill. libro. Inquisitionum Caput Primum,
        Halis Saxonum. 1899, PP. 41 ff.</note>
      </app> The discussion of the varieties of poetry, found in Diomedes, Grammatici Latini, i.
      482. 14 ff. K., was assigned to Suetonius by Reifferscheid and printed in his edition of 1860.
      Schanz also includes this among the fragments of the De Viris Illustribus,<app n="3">
       <note>3 Gesch. d. röm. Litt., in Müller's Handbuch, viii. 3, p. 53.</note>
      </app> but on insufficient grounds; see Teuffel, Geschichte der römischen Literatur, 6th ed.,
      iii., p. 57 and the literature there cited. From the Orators (De Oratoribus), with an index of
      fifteen names, only the brief abstract of the Life of Passienus Crispus has come down to us,
      preserved in the scholia Pithoeana on Juvenal 4. 81, where </p>
     <pb n="392"/>
     <p> Passienus is confused with Vibius Crispus. Although his source is not given by the
      scholiast, the Life is generally attributed to Suetonius. Since in the excerpts from the De
      Oratoribus made by Hieronymus we find no orator earlier than Cicero, it has been inferred that
      Suetonius began his biographies with Cicero and treated the earlier orators in a general
      introduction. From the Historians, with an index of six names, we have only the Life of Pliny
      the Elder, which is attributed to Suetonius in the manuscripts which contain it. Here
      Suetonius seems to have begun with Sallust, discussing the earlier historians in his
      introduction. From the De Philosophis we have only an index of three names, Marcus Terentius
      Varro, Publius Nigidius Figulus, and Lucius Annaeus Seneca, which have been recovered from
      Hieronymus. As in the Lives of the Caesars, Suetonius' sources for the Lives of Illustrious
      Men were in the main literary, in particular Varro, the previous writers of books of the same
      title (Nepos, Santra and Hyginus), Asconius and Fenestella. In part through these writers, and
      perhaps in part directly, his work goes back to the Greek authors Antigonus of Carystos,
      Aristoxenes, Satyros, and Hermippos. He also made some use of private letters, public
      documents, hearsay evidence and personal recollection. The Text of the De Grammaticis et
      Rhetoribus is in a less satisfactory condition than that of the Caesars, Some manuscripts of
      the better class have not yet been collated, and Ihm's untimely death has prevented or
      indefinitely postponed the publication of </p>
     <pb n="393"/>
     <p> the second volume of his edition with the text of the fragments. New recensions of the
      Lives have appeared in various editions of the authors in question and one of the Life of
      Vergil by E. Diehl in the Kleine Texte für theologische und philologische Vorlesungen und
      Uebungen, Bonn, 1911. To these may be added the careful examination and classification of the
      manuscripts by Rodney P. Robinson,<app n="1">
       <note>1 De Fragmenti Suetoniani de Gramm, et Rhet. Codicum Nexu et Fide, in the University of

      have usually not been recorded in our critical notes. Those readings of his which have been

      <p> THERE are three editions of the De Grammaticis et Rhetoribus that rank as principes: one
       of uncertain authorship and date, believed by some to have been published by Nicolas Jensen
       at Venice in 1472, a Venetian edition of 1474, and one issued at Florence in 1478. Other
       early editions are the Aldine, 1508, based upon the three principes, and those of R.
       Stephanus, E. Vinetus, and Achilles Statius. In more recent times separate editions have been
       published by L. Tross, 1841, Fr. Osann, Giessen, 1854, L. Roth, Leipzig, 1858, and A.
       Reifferscheid, Leipzig, 1860. The last two are still the standard texts. The De Viris
       Illustribus was first published with the Caesars by Antonius Gryphius at Lyons in 1566 and
       Th. Pulmann at Antwerp, in 1574. They were followed by Casaubon, and his edition, as well as
       others of those mentioned on p. xxvii of Volume I, contains the fragments. In 1863 H.
       Doergens published an edition at Leipzig with a German translation and a commentary. The only
       translation into English, so far as I know, is that of T. Forester in the Bohn library; see

       early days, still less held in any esteem; and naturally enough, since the state was then
       still uncultivated and given to war, and had as yet little leisure for liberal pursuits. The
       beginnings of the subject, too, were humble, for the earliest teachers, who were also both
       poets and Italian <note type="footnote" n="b">b Livius Andronicus came from Tarentum, and
        Ennius was a native of Rudiae in Calabria.</note> Greeks (I refer to Livius and Ennius, who
       gave instruction in both tongues at home and abroad, as is well known), did no more than
       interpret the Greeks or give readings from whatever they themselves had composed in the Latin
       language. For while some tell us that this same Ennius published a book " On Letters and
       Syllables " and another "On Metres, Lucius Cotta is right in maintaining that these were not
       the work of the poet, but of a later Ennius, who is also the author of the volumes " On the
       Science of Augury." <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>II. In my opinion then, the first to
       introduce the study of grammar into our city was Crates of Mallos, a contemporary of
       Aristarchus. He was sent to the senate by king Attalus between the second and third Punic
       wars, at about the time when Ennius died; <note type="margin">169 B.C.</note> and having
       fallen into the opening of a sewer in the Palatine quarter and broken his leg, he held

      <p> constantly gave instruction, and thus set an example for our countrymen to imitate. Their
       imitation, however, was confined to a careful criticism of poems which had as yet but little
       circulation, either those of deceased friends or others that met with their approval, and to
       making them known to the public by reading and commenting on them. For example, Gaius
       Octavius Lampadio thus treated the “Punic War " of Naevius, which was originally written in a
       single volume without a break, but was divided by Lampadio into seven books. At a later time
       Quintus Vargunteius took up the "Annals" of Ennius, which he expounded on set days to large
       audiences; and Laelius Archelaus and Vettius Philocomus the satires of their friend Lucilius,
       which Lenaeus Pompeius prides himself on having read with Archelaus, and Valerius Cato with
       Philocomus. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>III. The foundations of the study were laid, and
       it was advanced in all directions, by Lucius Aelius of Lanuvium and his son-in-law Servius
       Clodius, both of whom were Roman knights and men of wide and varied experience in scholarship
       and statecraft. Aelius had two surnames, for he was called Praeconinus because his father had

        <note type="footnote" n="b">b From stylus, an instrument for writing; see note on Jul.

       was so devoted to the aristocratic party, that he accompanied Metellus Numidicus into exile.
       Servius stole one of his father-in-law's books before it was published, and being in
       consequence disowned, left the city through shame and remorse, and fell ill of the gout.

       authority; but that it should strictly be used of interpreters of the poets, whom the Greeks
       call grammatici. That these were also called litteratores is shown by Messala Corvinus in one
       of his letters, in which he says: “I am not concerned with Furius Bibaculus, nor with Ticidas
       either, or with the litterator Cato. For he unquestionably refers to Valerius Cato, who was
       famous both as a poet and as a grammarian. Some however make a distinction between litteratus
       and litterator, as the Greeks do between grammaticus and grammatista, using the former of a
       master of his subject, the latter of one moderately proficient. Orbilius too supports this
       view by examples, saying: " In the days of our forefathers, when anyone s slaves were offered
       for sale, it was not usual except in special cases to advertise any one of them as litteratus
       but rather as litterator, implying that he had a smattering of letters, but was not a
       finished scholar. The grammarians of early days taught rhetoric as well, and we have
       treatises from many men on both subjects. It was this custom, I think, which led those of
       later times also, although the two professions had now become distinct, nevertheless either
       to retain or to introduce certain kinds of exercises suited to the training of orators, such
       as problems, paraphrases, addresses, character sketches and similar things; doubtless that
       they might not turn over their pupils to the rhetoricians wholly ignorant and unprepared.

       />VIII. Marcus Pompilius Andronicus, a native of Syria, because of his devotion to the
       Epicurean sect was considered somewhat indolent in his work as a grammarian and not qualified
       to conduct a school. Therefore, realizing that he was held in less esteem at Rome, not only
       than Antonius Gnipho, but than others of even less ability, he moved to Cumae, where he led a
       quiet life and wrote many books. But he was so poor and needy that he was forced to sell that
       admirable little work of his, “Criticisms of the Annals of Ennius " <note type="footnote"
        n="a">a Elenchus is a transliteration of the Greek ἔλεγχος, “refutation."

       the death of his parents, both of whom were slain on the selfsame day by treacherous enemies,
       at first earned a living as an attendant on the magistrates. He then served as a subaltern in
       Macedonia, and later in the cavalry. After completing his military service, he resumed his
       studies, to which he had given no little attention from boyhood; and after teaching for a
       long time in his native place, he at last went to Rome in his fiftieth year, when Cicero was

       Eratosthenes, who was first to lay claim to that surname, he regarded himself as a man of
       wide and varied learning. And that he was such is evident from his commentaries, though very

       set about writing history, he provided the one with an epitome of all Roman story, from which
       to select what he wished, and the other with rules on the art of composition. This makes me

       so that he was the more easily stripped of his patrimony in the lawless times of Sulla. He
       had many distinguished pupils and was regarded as a very competent teacher, especially of
       those who had a bent for poetry; as indeed is especially evident from these verses: " Cato,
       teacher of letters, Siren Latin-born, He, and none other, poets reads and makes." Besides

      <p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>I. THE study of rhetoric was introduced into our country
       in about the same way as that of grammar, but with somewhat greater difficulty, since, as is
       well known, its practice was at times actually prohibited. To remove any doubt on this point,
       I shall append an ancient decree of the senate, as well as an edict of the censors: “In the
       consulship of Gaius Fannius Strabo and <note type="margin">161 B. C.</note> Marcus Valerius
       Messala the praetor Marcus Pomponius laid a proposition before the senate. As the result of a
       discussion about philosophers and rhetoricians, the senate decreed that Marcus Pomponius, the
       praetor, should take heed and provide, in whatever way seemed in accord with the interests of
       the State and his oath of office, that they be not allowed to live in Rome." Some time
       afterward the censors Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus and Lucius Licinius <note n="marg">92
        B.C.</note> Crassus issued the following edict about the same class of men: “It has been
       reported to us that there be men who have introduced a new kind of training, and that our
       young men frequent their schools; that these men have assumed the title of Latin
       rhetoricians, and that young men spend whole days with them in idleness. Our forefathers </p>

      <p> determined what they wished their children to learn and what schools they desired them to
       attend. These innovations in the customs and principles of our forefathers do not please us
       nor seem proper. Therefore it appears necessary to make our opinion known, both to those who
       have such schools and to those who are in the habit of attending them, that they are
       displeasing to us.'' By degrees rhetoric itself came to seem useful and honourable, and many
       devoted themselves to it as a defence and for glory. Cicero continued to declaim in Greek as
       well as Latin up to the time of his praetorship, and in Latin even when he was getting on in
       years and that too in company with the future consuls Hirtius and Pansa, whom he calls “his
       pupils and his big boys.''<note type="footnote" n="a">a Cf. Seneca, Controv. 1. praef. 11
        ff.;Cic. Att. xiv. 22. 1; de Fato, 2.</note> Some historians assert that Gnaeus Pompeius
       resumed the practice of declaiming just before the civil war, that he might be the better
       able to argue against Gaius Curio, a young man of very ready tongue, who was espousing
       Caesar's cause; and that Marcus Antonius, and Augustus as well, did not give it up even
       during the war at Mutina. <note type="footnote" n="b">b Cf. Aug. lxxxiv. 1.</note> The
       emperor Nero declaimed in public in the first year of his reign, and had also declaimed twice
       before that. Furthermore, many even of the orators published declamations. In this way
       general enthusiasm was aroused, and a great number of masters and teachers flocked to Rome,
       where they were so well received that some advanced from the lowest estate to senatorial
       dignity and to the highest magistracies. But they did not all follow the same method of
       teaching, and the individual teachers also varied in their practice, since each one trained
       his pupils </p>

       the credibility of myths, an exercise which the Greeks call “destructive” and “constructive”
       criticism. But finally all these exercises <note type="footnote" n="b">b They corresponded in
        general with the Roman suasoriae, which with the controversiae formed the stock exercises of

       earlier debates were based either upon historical narrative, as indeed is sometimes the case
       at present, or upon some event of recent occurrence in real life. Accordingly they were
       usually presented with even the names of the localities included. At any rate that is the
       case with the published collections, from which it may be enlightening to give one or two
       specimens word for word. " Some young men from the city went to Ostia in the summer season,
       and arriving at the shore, found some fishermen drawing in their nets. They made a bargain to
       give a certain sum for the haul. The money was paid and they waited for some time until the
       nets were drawn ashore. When they were at last hauled out, no fish was found in them, but a
       closed basket of gold. Then the purchasers said that the catch belonged to them, the
       fishermen that it was theirs.” </p>

       wide experience, who believed that one s mind could better be trained by exercises in Greek.”
       Marcus Caelius, in a speech in which he defended himself against a charge of violence,
       implies that this same Plotius, for he lived to a great age, supplied Caelius's accuser,

       aedile in his native town and chanced to be sitting in judgment, was dragged by the feet from
       the tribunal by those against whom he was rendering a decision. Indignant at this, he at once

       Plancus, who had the habit, when he was going to declaim, of calling upon someone to speak
       before him. Albucius undertook that role, and filled it so effectively, that he reduced
       Plancus to silence, since he did not venture to enter into competition. But when Albucius had
       thus become famous, he opened a lecture room of his own, where it was his habit after

      <p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>I. PUBLIUS TERENTIUS AFER, born at Carthage, was the slave
       at Rome of Terentius Lucanus, a senator, who because of the young man's talent and good looks
       not only gave him a liberal education, but soon set him tree. Some think that he was taken in
       war, but Fenestella shows that that could not possibly be, since Terence was born and died
       between the end of the second Punic war and the beginning of the third; <note type="margin"
        >201-149 B.C.</note> and even if he had been taken by the Numidians and Gaetulians, he could
       not have come into the hands of a Roman general, since commerce between the Italic and the
       African races did not begin until after the destruction of Carthage. He lived on <note
        type="margin">146 B.C.</note> intimate terms with many men of high rank, in particular with
       Scipio Africanus and Gaius Laelius. It is even thought that he won the favour of these two
       men by his youthful beauty, but Fenestella denies this too, maintaining that he was older
       than either of them. Nepos, however, writes that they were all three of an age, and Porcius

       <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>III. It is common gossip that Scipio and Laelius aided
       Terence in his writings, and he himself lent colour to this by never attempting to refute it,
       except in a half-hearted way, as in the prologue to the Adelphoe”: “For as to what those
       malicious critics say, that men of rank aid your poet and constantly write in concert with
       him; what they regard as a grievous slander, he considers the highest praise, to please those
       who please you all and all the people, whose timely help everyone has used without shame in
       war, in leisure, in business.” Now he seems to have made but a lame defence, because he knew
       that the report did not displease Laelius and Scipio; and it gained ground in spite of all
       and came down even to later times. Gaius Memmius in a speech in his own defence says. "

       if Terence had really needed help in his writing, he would not have been so likely to resort
       to Scipio and Laelius, who were then mere youths, as to Gaius Sulpicius Gallus, a scholarly
       man, at whose consular games he brought out his first play, or to Quintus Fabius Labeo and
       Marcus Popillius, both of whom were ex-consuls and poets; and that it was for that reason

      <p>PUBLIUS VERGILIUS MARO, a native Of Mantua, had parents of humble origin, especially his
       father, who according to some was a potter, although the general opinion is that he was at
       first the hired man of a certain Magus, an attendant on the magistrates, later became his
       son-in-law because of his diligence, and greatly increased his little property by buying up
       woodlands and raising bees. He was born in the first consulship of Gnaeus Pompeius the Great
       and Marcus Licinius Crassus, on the Ides <note n="marg">Oct. 15, 70 B.C.</note> of October,
       in a district called Andes, not far distant from Mantua. While he was in his mother's womb,
       she dreamt that she gave birth to a laurel-branch, which on touching the earth took root and
       grew at once to the size of a full-grown tree, covered with fruits and flowers of various
       kinds; and on the following day, when she was on the way to a neighbouring part of the
       country with her husband, she turned aside and gave birth to her child in a ditch beside the
       road. They say that the infant did not cry at its birth, and had such a gentle expression as
       even then to give assurance of an unusually happy destiny. There was added another omen; for
       a poplar branch, which, as was usual in that region on such occasions, was at once planted
       where the birth occurred, grew so fast in a short time that it equalled in size poplars
       planted long before. It was called from him " Vergil's tree” and was besides worshipped with
       great veneration by </p>

       early life at Cremona until he assumed the gown of manhood, upon his fifteenth birthday, in
       the consulship of the same two men who had been consuls the year he was born; and <note
        n="marg">55 B.C.</note> it chanced that the poet Lucretius died that very same day. Vergil,
       however, moved from Cremona to Mediolanum, and shortly afterwards from there to Rome, He was
       tall and of full habit, with a dark complexion and a rustic appearance. His health was
       variable; for he very often suffered from stomach and throat troubles, as well as with
       headache; and he also had frequent haemorrhages. He ate and drank but little. He was
       especially given to passions for boys, and his special favourites were Cebes and Alexander,
       whom he calls Alexis in the second poem of his “Bucolics.” This boy was given him by Asinius
       Pollio, and both his favourites had some education, while Cebes was even a poet. It is common
       report that he also had an intrigue with Plotia Hieria. But Asconius Pedianus declares that
       she herself used to say afterwards, when she was getting old, that Vergil was invited by
       Varius to associate with her, but obstinately refused. Certain it is that for the rest of his
       life he was so modest in speech and thought, that at Naples he was commonly called "
       Parthenias," <note type="footnote" n="a">a “The Maiden."</note> and that whenever he appeared
       in public in Rome, where he very rarely went, he would take refuge in the nearest house, to

       “Culex" when he was sixteen years old. The story of the “Culex " is this. When a shepherd,

      <p> remarking that he fashioned his poem after the manner of a she-bear, and gradually licked
       it into shape. In the case of the " Aeneid," after writing a first draft in prose and
       dividing it into twelve books, he proceeded to turn into verse one part after another, taking
       them up just as he fancied, in no particular order. And that he might not check the flow of
       his thought, he left some things unfinished, and, so to speak, bolstered others up with very
       slight words, which, as he jocosely used to say, were put in like props, to support the
       structure until the solid columns should arrive. The "Bucolics" he finished in three years,
       the " Georgics'' in seven, the “Aeneid” in twelve. The success of the “Bucolics” on their
       first appearance was such, that they were even frequently rendered by singers on the stage.
       When Augustus was returning after his victory at Actium and lingered at Atella to treat his
       throat, Vergil read the "Georgics" to him for four days in succession, Maecenas taking his
       turn at the reading whenever the poet was interrupted by the failure of his voice. His own
       delivery, however, was sweet and wonderfully effective. In fact, Seneca has said that the
       poet Julius Montanus used to declare that he would have purloined some of Vergil's work, if
       he could also have stolen his voice, expression, and dramatic power; for the same verses
       sounded well when Vergil read them, which on another's lips were flat and toneless. Hardly
       was the "Aeneid" begun, when its repute became so great that Sextus Propertius <note
        type="footnote" n="a">a 2. 34. 65 f.</note> did not hesitate to declare: " Yield, ye Roman
       writers; yield, ye Greeks; A greater than the Iliad is born." </p>

       Aeneid '"; to use his own words, "either the first draft of the poem or any section of it
       that he pleased." But it was not until long afterwards, when the material was at last in
       shape, that Vergil read to him three books in all, the second, fourth, and sixth. The last of
       these produced a remarkable effect on Octavia, who was present at the reading; for it is said
       that when he reached the verses about her son, "Thou shalt be Marcellus,"<note
        type="footnote" n="a">a Aen. 6. 884 f.</note> she fainted and was with difficulty revived.
       He gave readings also to larger audiences but never frequently, and he selected for the most
       part passages about which he was in doubt, in order to get the benefit of criticism. They say
       that Eros, his amanuensis and freedman, used to report, when he was an old man, that Vergil
       once completed two half-verses off-hand in the course of a reading. For having before him
       merely the words " Misenum Aeoliden,” he added " quo non praestantior alter,”<note
        type="footnote" n="b">b Aen. 6. 164.</note> and again to "aere ciere viros " he joined

       like inspiration, and ho immediately ordered Eros to add both half-lines to his manuscript.
       In the fifty-second year of his age, wishing to give the final touch to the " Aeneid," he
       determined to go away to Greece and Asia, and after devoting three entire years to the sole
       work of improving his poem, to give up the rest of his life wholly to philosophy. But having

      <p>QUINTUS HORATIUS FLACCUS of Venusia had for a father, as he himself writes, a freedman who
       was a collector of money at auctions; but it is believed that he was a dealer in salted
       provisions, for a certain man in a quarrel thus taunted Horace: “How often have I seen your
       father wiping his nose with his arm!" Horace served as tribune of the soldiers in the war of
       Philippi, at the instance of Marcus Brutus, one of the leaders in that war. When his party
       was vanquished, he was pardoned and purchased the position of a quaestor's clerk. Then
       contriving to win the favour, first of Maecenas and later of Augustus, he held a prominent
       place among the friends of both. How fond Maecenas was of him is evident enough from the well
       known epigram. " If that I do not love yon, my own Horace, more than life itself, behold your
       comrade leaner than Ninnius.” <note type="footnote" n="a">a Ninnius is unknown, but if the
        reading be correct, he was notorious for his leanness; cf. Telegenius, Claud. xl. 3.</note>
       But he expressed himself much more strongly in his last will and testament in this brief
       remark to Augustus: " Be as mindful of Horatius Flaccus as of myself." Augustus offered him
       the post of secretary, as appears in this letter of his to Maecenas: " Before this I was able

        patron,” since Augustus would hardly use regiam literally of his table. The meaning would
        then be "let the parasite change tables (and patrons).”</note> Even when Horace declined,
       Augustus showed no resentment at all, and did not cease his efforts to gain his friendship.
       We have letters from which I append a few extracts by way of proof: “Enjoy any privilege at
       my house, as if you were making your home there; for it will be quite right and proper for
       you to do so, inasmuch as that was the relation which I wished to have with you, if your
       health had permitted." And again, " How mindful I am of you our friend Septimius can also
       tell you; for it chanced that I spoke of you in his presence. Even if you were so proud as to
       scorn my friendship, I do not therefore return your disdain. Besides this, among other
       pleasantries, he often calls him "a most immaculate libertine”<note type="footnote" n="b">b
        See Th. Birt, Müller's Handbuch, 1 3. 3.166.</note> and "his charming little man, and he
       made him well to do by more than one act of generosity. As to his writings, Augustus rated
       them so high, and was so convinced that they would be immortal, that he not only appointed
       him to write the Secular Hymn, but also bade him celebrate the victory of his stepsons
       Tiberius and Drusus over the Vindelici, and so compelled him to add a fourth to his three
       books of lyrics after a long silence. Furthermore, after reading several of his " talks,"
        <note type="footnote" n="c">c Sermones was apparently the title which Horace gave his "

       which begins with these words: " Seeing that single-handed thou dost bear the burden of tasks
       so many and so great, protecting Italy's realm with arms, providing it with morals, reforming

       part, as an apology. But you seem to me to be afraid that your books may be bigger than you

       pot, that the circumference of your volume may be well rounded out, like that of your own

       with mirrors he had harlots so arranged that whichever way he looked, he saw a reflection of
       venery. He lived for the most part in the country on his Sabine or Tiburtine estate, and his
       house is pointed out near the little grove of Tiburnus. I possess some elegies attributed to
       his pen and a letter in prose, supposed to be a recommendation of himself to Maecenas, but I

       a Roman knight, but was connected by blood and by marriage with men of the senatorial order.
       He died on his estate near the eighth milestone of the Appian Way. His father Flaccus died
       when his son was about six years old, leaving him to the care of a guardian. His mother,
       Fulvia Sisennia, afterwards married a Roman knight named Fusius, but buried him also within a
       few years. Flaccus studied until the twelfth year of his age at Volaterrae, and then at Rome

       the rhetorician Verginius Flavus. When he was sixteen years old he became so intimate a
       friend of Annaeus Cornutus that he never left his side; and from him he obtained some
       knowledge of philosophy. From early youth he enjoyed the friendship of Caesius Bassus, the
       poet, and of Calpurnius Statura, who died in youth, while Persius still lived. Servilius

       Flaccus, that when the author read them in the usual way,<note type="footnote" n="a">a That
        is, gave a public reading.</note> he could hardly wait until he finished before saying that
       they were true poems, and his own mere child's play. Towards the end of his life he made the
       acquaintance also of Seneca, but was not impressed by his talents. At the house of Cornutus
       he enjoyed the society of two learned and venerable men, who were then eagerly pursuing
       philosophical studies: Claudius Agathurnus, a physician of Lacedaemon, and Petronius
       Aristocrates of Magnesia, whom he admired exceedingly and emulated, although they were of the
       same age as Cornutus, while he was a younger man. He was also for nearly ten years so great a
       favourite of Paetus Thrasea that he sometimes even travelled abroad with him; and Paetus's
       wife, Arria, was a relative of his. He was very gentle in manner, of virginal modesty and
       very handsome; and he showed an exemplary devotion to his mother, sister, and aunt. He was
       good and pure. He left about two million sesterces to his mother and sister, and a letter
       addressed only to his mother. He requested her to give Cornutus a hundred thousand, as some
       say, or according to others, fifty thousand sesterces, and twenty pounds of silver plate,
       besides about seven hundred volumes of Chrysippus, or his entire library. But Cornutus, while

      <p> He wrote rarely and slowly. This very volume <note type="footnote" n="a">a The collection
        of six satires, for which this Life was used as an introduction.</note> he left unfinished,
       and some verses were taken from the last book, that it might have the appearance of
       completion. Cornutus made some slight corrections, and on the request of Caesius Bassus that
       he might publish it, turned it over to him for that purpose. In his boyhood Flaccus had
       written a praetexta <note type="footnote" n="b">b A Roman tragedy.</note> one book describing
       his travels, and a few verses on the mother-in-law of Thrasea,<note type="footnote" n="c">c

       advised the poet's mother to destroy. As soon as his book appeared, men began to admire it
       and to buy it up rapidly. He died of a stomach trouble in the thirtieth year of his age. As
       soon as he left school and his teachers, he conceived a strong desire to write satires from
       reading the tenth book of Lucilius. The beginning of this he imitated with the intention at
       first of criticizing himself; but presently turning to general criticism,<note
        type="footnote" n="d">d Text and meaning are uncertain; see Marx, Lucilius, 2, p.
        145.</note> he so assailed the poets and orators of his day, that he even attacked Nero, who
       was at that time emperor. His verse on Nero read as follows: “King Midas has ass s ears,” but
       Cornutus by merely changing the name, and writing “Who has not an ass's ears? " so altered it
       that Nero might not think that it was said of him. </p>

      <p>PASSIENUS CRISPUS, a native of Visellium, began his first speech in the senate with these
       words: "Conscript fathers and you, Caesar," and was in consequence highly commended by
       Tiberius, though not sincerely. He voluntarily pleaded a number of cases in the court of the

       respectively the aunt and the mother of the emperor Nero. He possessed an estate of two
       hundred million sesterces. He tried to gain favour with all the emperors, but especially with
       Gaius Caesar, whom he attended on foot when the emperor made a journey. When he was asked by
       Nero <note type="footnote" n="c">c Gaius is obviously intended, instead of Nero.</note> in a
       private conversation whether he had commerce with his own sister, as the emperor had with
       his, he replied "Not yet”; a very fitting and cautious answer, neither accusing the emperor
       by denying the allegation, nor dishonouring himself with a lie by admitting it. He was slain
       by the treachery of Agrippina, whom he had made his heir, and was honoured with a public
       funeral. </p>

    <p>sestertius (semis tertius, se. nummus), a Roman coin, originally of silver but later of
     bronze, equal to 24 asses, or one-fourth of a denarius. It was equal to 2½d. or 5 cents, and is
     the unit in which sums of money were most commonly reckoned by the Romans. It was abbreviated
     HS=2½. In reckoning thousands of sesterces the original gen. pl. sestertium was often used as a
     neuter singular; e. g. Tib. XLII. 2 ducenta sestertia=200,000 sesterces; but cf. Calig. XXXIX.
     2 ducentis milibus. In reckoning larger sums the numeral adverb was commonly used, either with
     the gen. pl. sestertium, or with the case of sestertium demanded by the context. In such
     instances centena milia is understood: e.g. Jul. L. 2 sexagiens (centena milia) sestertium
     margaritam mercatus est (=6,000,000 sesterces, or $300,000); Tib. XLVIII. 1, proposito milies
     (centena milia) sestertium (=100,000,000 sesterces). Suetonius has 23 cases of the former
     construction and apparently always used it. The latter, however, is not uncommon; see, for
     example, Tac. Ann. 2. 37 liberalitate decies sestertli, and for a full discussion of the
     subject, Howard, Harvard Studies in Classical Philology, VII. 210 ff.</p>

    <p>Zmyrna, Gr. XVIII. (bis); An epic poem of C. Helvius Cinna, a contemporary of Cicero and
     Caesar, on the subject of the love of Myrrha, or Zmyrna, for her father Cinyras. Although the
     poem was of small compass he spent nine years in elaborating it, and it abounded in obscure
     mythological allusions and pedantic learning; so that many grammarians acquired fame by writing
     commentaries on it.</p>
