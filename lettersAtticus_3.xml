                <p> INTRODUCTION The letters contained in this volume begin with one written just
                    after Caesar's final victory over the remains of the Pompeian party at Thapsus
                    in April, 46 B.C., and cover three of the last four years of Cicero's life. When
                    they open, Cicero was enjoying a restful interval after the troublous times of
                    the Civil War. He had made his peace with Caesar and reconciled himself to a
                    life of retirement and literary activity. In the Senate he never spoke except to
                    deliver a speech pleading for the return from exile of his friend Marcellus; and
                    his only other public appearance was to advocate the cause of another friend,
                    Ligarius. In both he was successful; and, indeed, so he seems also to have been
                    in private appeals to Caesar on behalf of friends. But their relations were
                    never intimate,<note type="footnote" n="1">1 XIV. 1 and 2.</note> and Cicero
                    appears always to have felt ill at ease in Caesar's society,<note
                        type="footnote" n="2">2 XIII. 52.</note> disliking and fearing him as a
                    possible tyrant or at least an anomaly in a Republican state. He evidently felt,
                    too, some natural qualms at being too much of a turn-coat, as he dissuaded his
                    son from joining Caesar's expedition to Spain at the end of the year on that
                    ground, and persuaded him to go to Athens to study instead.<note type="footnote"
                        n="3">3 XII 7.</note> No doubt he considered that it was more consonant with
                    the dignity which he was always claiming for himself to take no part in public
                    affairs at all than to play a secondary part where he had once been first.
                    Consequently he spent the year 46 peacefully engaged in writing and in his </p>

                <pb n="viii"/>
                <p> private affairs; and even of those we hear little, as he was at Rome the greater
                    part of the time. Somewhat under protest he wrote, apparently at the suggestion
                    of the Caesarian party,<note type="footnote" n="1">1 XII. 4.</note> with most of
                    whom he was on good terms, a work on Cato, which satisfied neither friend nor
                    foe, as Brutus thought it necessary to write another himself, and Caesar
                    composed an Anti-Cato. Of his other writings, two rhetorical works, the Brutus
                    and the Orator, and one philosophical, the Paradoxa, fall in this year. In the
                    early part of it he divorced Terentia, and at the end of it married his rich and
                    youthful ward Publilia; but he soon separated from her. The unhappy marriage
                    between his daughter Tullia and her profligate husband, Dolabella, was dissolved
                    at much the same time, but she only survived for a few months. Her death, which
                    occurred in February, 45 B.C., seems to have prostrated Cicero with grief, and a
                    long series of daily letters, from March to August of that year, are largely
                    filled with reiterations of his grief and projects for the erection of a shrine
                    in her honour. They are interesting for the light they cast on Atticus'
                    treatment of Cicero when he was unstrung and excited. Atticus evidently
                    disapproved entirely of the project; but from Cicero's answers one infers that
                    he kept on humouring him and at the same time delaying action on his part by
                    continual suggestions of a fresh site for the shrine, knowing that Cicero's
                    ardour would cool and the scheme drop through, as it did. Much is said, too, in
                    these letters about the literary work to which Cicero turned with more eagerness
                    than ever to assuage his grief; and the output was enormous. A book on
                    consolation in </p>

                <pb n="ix"/>
                <p> times of sorrow, a general introduction to the philosophical works which
                    followed, the De Finibus, the Academica—rewritten three times<note
                        type="footnote" n="1">1 XIII. 13 and 16.</note>—and a small rhetorical
                    treatise, the Partitiones Oratoriae, were published during the year, while the
                    Tusculanae Disputationes, the De Natura Deorum and the De Senectute were
                    projected and begun. Certainly Cicero was right in saying that he had no lack of
                        words!<note type="footnote" n="2">2 XII. 52.</note> Of political affairs
                    little is said; indeed, in Caesar's absence there was not much to say. But there
                    are occasional sneers at the honours paid to him<note type="footnote" n="3">3
                        XII. 45; XIII. 27 and 44.</note> and at his projected extension of
                        Rome.<note type="footnote" n="4">4 XIII. 35.</note> For the latter part of
                    the year, after Caesar's return from Spain, there are no letters in this
                    collection except two amusing letters in December, one describing a conversation
                    with his nephew, who was trying to make peace with his relatives after a violent
                        quarrel,<note type="footnote" n="5">5 XIII. 42.</note> and the other
                    Cicero's entertainment of Caesar at Puteoli.<note type="footnote" n="6">6 XIII.
                        52.</note> Not long afterwards came the murder of Caesar, at which Cicero to
                    his regret was not present, though he was in Rome and hastened to the Capitol to
                    lend his support to the murderers. He found, however, the cold Brutus hard to
                    stir into action, and after Antony's speech at the funeral he thought it wiser
                    to retire from Rome. The letters written at the time are full of rejoicing at
                    the death of a man, towards whom he never seems to have felt any attraction, in
                    spite of the kindness he had received at his hands. But he soon realised the
                    hopelessness of the Republican cause, which lacked both a leader and a
                    following. He himself regained something </p>

                <pb n="x"/>
                <p> of his old position, and we find him not only consulted by Brutus and the rest
                    of his party, but politely addressed by Antony in a note, asking his permission
                    to recall Cicero's old enemy Clodius.<note type="footnote" n="1">1 XIV.
                        13a.</note> Cicero, taking the request as a demand, returned an equally
                    polite note of assent;<note type="footnote" n="2">2 XIV. 13b.</note> but what he
                    thought of the request and of Antony is shown by a letter sent to Atticus
                        simultaneously.<note type="footnote" n="3">3 XIV. 13.</note> For a while
                    there are occasional bursts of hope in a revival of the old constitution, for
                    instance when Dolabella threw down the column erected in the forum in honour of
                        Caesar;<note type="footnote" n="4">4 XIV. 15.</note> but despair at the
                    inactivity of Brutus and his friends and at Antony's growing influence and the
                    respect shown for Caesar's enactment after his death prevail; and Cicero
                    contemplated crossing to Greece to visit his son and escape from the war he
                    foresaw. Octavian's arrival and opposition to Antony did not comfort him much,
                    in spite of attentions paid to himself by the future emperor, as he mistrusted
                    Octavian's youth, his abilities and his intentions. But, when just on the point
                    of sailing, news reached him that there was a chance of Antony giving way and
                    peace with something of the old conditions being restored; and he hurried back
                    to Rome to take his part in its restoration.<note type="footnote" n="5">5 XVI.
                        7.</note> There he found little chance of peace, but, once returned, he
                    recovered sufficient courage to take the lead in the Senate and deliver his
                    first Philippic against Antony. After that there arc only a few letters written
                    towards the end of the year. In them he still expresses great mistrust for
                    Octavian, who was continually appealing to him for his support;<note
                        type="footnote" n="6">6 XVI. 9 and 11.</note> and, in spite of his renewed
                    entry into public affairs, one </p>

                <pb n="xi"/>
                <p> is rather surprised to find that he was still working at his philosophical
                    treatises, writing the De Officiis to dedicate to his son,<note type="footnote"
                        n="1">1 XVI. 11.</note> and even eager to turn to history at the suggestion
                    of Atticus.<note type="footnote" n="2">2 XVI. 13b.</note> Such is the last
                    glimpse we get of him in the Letters to Atticus. Shortly afterwards he returned
                    to Rome, and for some six months led the senatorial party in its opposition to
                    Antony; but, when Octavian too turned against the party and the struggle became
                    hopeless, he retired to Tusculum, where he lived until he was proscribed by the
                    Triumvirs early in December. Then he contemplated flight to Greece, but was
                    killed at Astura before he had succeeded in leaving Italy. I must again
                    acknowledge my indebtedness in preparing the translation to Tyrrell's edition of
                    the Letters and to Shuckburgh's translation, from both of which I have
                    "conveyed" many a phrase. The text is as usual based on the Teubner edition, and
                    textual notes have been mainly confined to passages where a reading not found in
                    that edition was adopted. In those notes the following abbreviations are used:—
                    M=the Codex Mediceus 49, 18, written in the year 1389 A.D., and now preserved in
                    the Laurentian Library at Florence. Ml denotes the reading of the first hand,
                    and M2 that of a reviser. Δ = the reading of M when supported by that of the
                    Codex Urbinas 322, a MS. of the fifteenth century, preserved in the Vatican
                    Library. 0 = Codex 1, 5, 34 in the University Library at Turin, written in the
                    fifteenth century. 01 denotes the reading of the first hand, and O'2 that of a
                    reviser. </p>

                <pb n="xii"/>
                <p> C =the marginal readings in Cratander's edition of 1528, drawn from a MS. which
                    is lost. Z = the readings of the lost Codex Tornaesianus. Zb, Zl, Zt the
                    readings of the same MS. when attested only by Bosius, Lambinus, or Turnebus
                    respectively. L (marg.) = readings in the margin of Lambinus' second edition.

                    Silani, Murenae, designatorum consulum. Cur ergo in sententiam Catonis? Quia
                    verbis luculentioribus et pluribus rem eandem comprehenderat. Me autem hic

                    perscribendaque censuerat, idcirco in eius sententiam est facta discessio. Hic
                    autem se etiam tribuere multum mi putat, quod scripserit " optimum consulem."

                    TO ATTICUS, GREETING. <note type="margin">Arpinum, Not. 23, B.C. of 46</note> On
                    the eleventh day after parting from you I have scribbled these few lines while
                    leaving my country house before daybreak. I am thinking stopping to-day at my
                    place at Anagnia, to-morrow at Tusculum and staying there one day. On the 26th
                    then to our tryst; and I only wish I could run straight to the embraces of my
                    Tullia and the lips of Attica. What those little lips are prattling, please
                    write and let me know, while I am at Tusculum, or, if she is in the country,
                    what she is writing to you: and in the meantime pay my respects by letter or in
                    person to her, and to Pilia too. And all the same, though we are to meet at
                    once, write to me, if you have anything to say. As I was folding up this letter,
                    a messenger came in the night to me with a letter of yours, and on reading it I
                    was naturally very sorry to hear of Attica's slight attack of fever. Everything
                    else I was wanting to hear, I learn from your letter. You say it is a sign of
                    old age to want a bit of fire in the morning: it's a worse sign of old age to be
                    a bit weak in your memory. I had arranged for the 27th with Axius, the 28th with
                    you, and the 26th, the day I arrive, with Quintus. So please count on </p>

                    What's the use of writing then? What's the use of our meeting and chattering
                    about everything that comes into our heads? A bit of gossip is something after
                    all, and, even if there is nothing in our talk, the mere fact of talking
                    together has some charms. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>II CICERO TO ATTICUS,

                    eight days of games! Picture their dinners and their extravagant goings on.
                    Perhaps in the meantime the great question has been settled. What people they
                    are! So Balbus is building: little he recks. But, if you ask me, is not life
                    over and done with, when a man begins to look for pleasure rather than duty? In

                    sometimes in the case of other people, certainly we never use it to one another.
                    So listen to what I am saying with all sincerity. On my life, Atticus, I don't
                    count even the Isles of the Blest, let alone my place at Tusculum—though in
                    other respects I'm comfortable enough there—worth so long a separation from you.
                    So let us harden our hearts for these three days—assuming that you are affected
                    as I am, which I am sure is the case. But I should like to know whether you are

                    three means I might use. I could buy the property at a public auction; but I
                    would rather lose it—it comes to the same thing in the end, besides the
                    disgrace. I might transfer my rights for a bond payable a year hence by the
                    buyer: but whom can I trust, and when would that " year of Meton "<note

                    look into the matter. The fact is I am afraid Caesar may not hold any auction

                    anxious because Tiro had said you looked to him rather flushed. So I will stay
                    another day, as you suggest. But about Cato, that would puzzle a Philadelphia
                    lawyer. I cannot manage to write anything that your boon companions could read,
                    I won't say with pleasure, but even without annoyance. If I steer clear of his
                    utterances in the House and of his entire political outlook and policy, and
                    content myself with simply eulogizing his unwavering constancy, even that would
                    be no pleasant hearing for them. But he is a man who cannot properly be
                    eulogized, unless these points are fully treated, that he foresaw the present
                    state of affairs, and tried to prevent it, and that he took his own life by
                    preference to seeing it come about. Can I win Aledius' approval of any of that?
                    But pray be careful of yourself and devote the common sense you devote to other
                    things, before all to recovering your health. </p>

                        46</note> I have scribbled a note with all you want on a tablet, and given
                    it to Eros—quite shortly, but more than you ask for. In it I have spoken about
                    my son, of whose intentions you gave me the first hint. I took a most liberal
                    tone with him, and, if you think it convenient, I should like you to ask him
                    about that. But why put it off? I pointed out that you had told me what he
                    wished to do and what he wanted: " he wished to go to Spain, and wanted a
                    liberal allowance." As for the allowance, I said I would give him as much as
                    Publilius or Lentulus the flamen gave their sons. Against Spain I brought
                    forward two arguments, the first, the one I used to you, that I was afraid of
                    adverse criticism: "Was it not enough that we abandoned one side? Must we take
                    the other?" The second that he would be annoyed, if his cousin enjoyed Caesar's
                    intimacy and general goodwill more than he did. [ should prefer him to make use
                    of my liberal offer rather than of his liberty. However I gave him permission;
                    for I saw you did not really dislike the idea. I shall think the matter over
                    carefully, and I hope you will too. It is an important point: to stay is simple,
                    to go risky. But we shall see. </p>

                    fight against it. As to what you say about Appuleius, I don't think you need

                    I wrote to you yesterday about offering my excuses to Appuleius. I don't think

                <pb n="29"/>
                <p> refuse. But see Septimius, Laenas and Statilius. There must be three. However
                    Laenas undertook the whole matter for me. You say you have been dunned by
                    Junius. Well anyhow Cornificius is rich enough to pay: but I should like to know
                    when they say I went bail for him, and whether it was for the father or the son.
                    Still for all that, do as you say, and see Cornificius' agents and Appuleius the
                    estate agent. You are as kind as usual in wishing that I could get some relief
                    from my grief; but you can bear witness that it is no fault of mine. For every
                    word that has been written by anyone on the subject of assuaging grief I read at
                    your house. But my sorrow is beyond any consolation. Why, I have done what no
                    one has ever done before, tried to console myself by writing a book. I will send
                    it to you as soon as it is copied out. I assure you no other consolation equals
                    it. I write the whole day long, not that it does any good, but it acts as a
                    temporary check: not very much of that, for the violence of my grief is too
                    strong; but still I get some relief and try with all my might to attain some
                    composure of countenance, if not of mind. In so doing sometimes I think I am
                    doing wrong, and sometimes that I should be doing wrong, if I were not to do it.
                    Solitude helps a little, but it would have much more effect, if you at any rate
                    could be with me: and that is my only reason for leaving, for the place is as
                    right as any could be under the circumstances. However even the idea of seeing
                    you upsets me: for now you can never feel the same towards me. I have lost all
                    you used to love. I have mentioned Brutus' letter to me before: </p>

                <pb n="31"/>
                <p> it was full of wise saws, but nothing that could help me. To you he wrote asking
                    if I should like his company. Yes, it would do me some good, as he has so great
                    an affection for me. If you have any news, please write and let me know,

                    the other sureties; for before my aedileship I had no dealings with Cornificius.
                    It may be so: but I should like to know for certain. And please demand payment
                    from his agents, if you think it right. However it's of no importance: but
                    still—. Let me know when Pansa departs, when you know yourself. Pay my respects
                    to Attica, and pray look after her well. Greet Pilia for me. </p>

                        type="margin">Astura, March 11, B.C 45</note> In trying to escape from the
                    painful sting of recollection I take refuge in recalling something to your
                    memory. Whatever you think of it, please pardon me. The fact is I find that some
                    of the authors over whom 1 am poring now, consider appropriate the very thing
                    that I have often discussed with you, and I hope you approve of it. I mean the
                    shrine. Please give it all the attention your affection for me dictates. For my
                    part I have no doubt about the design (I like Cluatius' design), nor about the
                    erection (on that I am quite determined); but I have some doubts about the
                    place. So please consider it. I shall use all the opportunities of this
                    enlightened age to consecrate her memory by every kind of memorial borrowed from
                    the genius of all the masters, Greek and Latin. Perhaps it will only gall my
                    wound: but I consider myself pledged by a kind of vow or promise; and I am more
                    concerned about the long ages, when I shall not be here, than about my short
                    day, which, short though it is, seems all too long to me. I have tried
                    everything and find nothing that gives me rest. For, while I was engaged on the
                    essay 1 mentioned before, I was to some extent fostering my grief. Now I reject
                    everything and find nothing more tolerable than solitude. Philippus has not
                    disturbed it as I feared: for after paying me a visit yesterday he returned at
                    once to Rome. I have sent you the letter I have written at your suggestion to
                    Brutus. Please have it delivered with your own. However I have sent you a copy
                    of it, </p>

                <pb n="37"/>
                <p> so that, if you don't approve of it, you may not send it. You say my private
                    affairs are being properly managed. Write and tell me what they are; for there
                    are some things I am expecting to hear about. See that Cocceius does not
                    disappoint me: for I count Libo's promise, of which Eros writes, as trustworthy.
                    My capital of course I leave in Sulpicius' and Egnatius' hands. Why trouble
                    yourself about Appuleius, when my excuse is so easily made? About coming to me
                    as you suggest, take care not to inconvenience yourself. It is a long way, and
                    it will cost me many a pang to let you go again, when you want to go, which may
                    happen very quickly. But just as you please. Whatever you do, I shall count it
                    right and know you have done it for my sake. <milestone unit="section" n="18a"

                    to my not calling certain people as witnesses, in the first place it never
                    entered my mind, and in the second the reason why it never entered it, was
                    because it was of no importance. You know, if you remember, that I told you to
                    bring some of your friends. What need was there of many? I had asked members of
                    my household. Then you thought I ought to send tor Silius. Hence it came about
                    that I sent for Publilius. But neither of them was necessary. Manage the point

                    times in the countless years to come, if our empire last, and must arrange that
                    that shrine may remain as consecrated ground. For my part I don't want a large
                    income now and can be contented with little. I think at times of buying some
                    gardens across the Tiber, especially for this reason: I don't see any other
                    place that can be so much frequented. But what gardens, we will consider
                    together; provided only that the shrine must be completed this summer. However

                <p> What you say about Cocceius and Libo I approve, especially as regards my serving
                    on juries. if you have ascertained anything about my guarantee, I should like to
                    know, and anyhow, what Cornificius' agents say, though I don't want you to take
                    much trouble about the matter, when you are so busy. About Antony, Balbus and
                    Oppius too have written to me saying you wished them to write, to save me from
                    anxiety. I have thanked •them. I should wish you to know however, as I have said
                    before, that I was not disturbed at that news and shall never be disturbed at
                    any again. If Pansa has set out to-day, as you thought, henceforth begin to tell
                    me in your letters what you expect about Brutus' return, I mean about what day.
                    That you can easily guess, if you know where he is at the time of writing. As
                    regards your letter to Tiro about Terentia, I beg you, Atticus, to undertake the
                    whole matter. You see there is a question of my duty concerned, and you know all
                    about that: besides, some think there is my son's interest. With me it is the
                    first point that weighs most, as being the more sacred and the more important:

                    Brutus' letter and am sending it back to you. It is not at all a sensible answer
                    to the points in which you found him wanting. But that is his look out: though
                    in one thing it shows disgraceful ignorance on his part. He thinks Cato was the
                    first to deliver a speech for the punishment of the conspirators, though
                    everybody except Caesar had spoken before him: and that, though Caesar's speech,
                    delivered from the praetorian bench, was so severe, those of the ex-consuls,
                    Catulus, Servilius, the Luculli, Curio, Torquatus, Lepidus, Gellius, Volcacius,
                    Figulus, Cotta, L. Caesar, C. Piso, M'. Glabrio, and even the consuls elect
                    Silanus and Murena, were milder. Why then was the division taken on Cato's
                    proposal? Because he had summed up the same matter in clearer and fuller words.
                    My merit according to Brutus lay in bringing the affair </p>

                <pb n="45"/>
                <p> before the House, not in finding it out, nor in urging them to take steps, nor
                    yet in making up my own mind before I took the House's opinion. And it was
                    because Cato extolled those actions of mine to the skies and moved that they
                    should be put on record, that the vote was taken on his motion. Brutus again
                    seems to think he is giving me high praise by calling me an "excellent consul."
                    Why, has anyone, even a personal enemy, ever used a more grudging term? To the
                    rest of your criticisms too what a poor answer he has given! He only asks you to
                    alter the point about the decree of the Senate. He would have done as much as
                    that at the suggestion of a clerk. But that again is his own look out. Since you
                    approve of the garden idea, manage it somehow. You know my resources. If I get

                    There are things I could sell easily too. But without selling anything, if I pay
                    interest to the person from whom I buy for no more than a year, I can get what I
                    want, if you assist me. The most available are those of Drusus, as he wants to
                    sell. The next I think are Lamia's; but he is away. However scent out anything
                    you can. Silius again never uses his at all, and he will very easily be
                    satisfied with the interest. Regard it as your own business, and don't consider

                    thought you had some news from me: but I see you have answered my letter only as
                    regards the forum and the Senate. But, you say, my house at Rome is a forum.
                    What is the good of the house alone to me, if I have not the forum? I am dead
                    and done for, Atticus, and have been this long while: but now I confess it, when
                    I have lost the one link that bound me to life. So what I want is solitude.
                    Still if in my despite anything drags me to Rome, I shall strive, if possible
                    (and I will make it possible), to keep my grief from all eyes but yours, and, if
                    it is anyhow possible, even from yours. </p>

                <p> Besides there is this reason for not coming. You remember the questions Aledius

                    if I come? Arrange about Terentia as you say, and rid me of this addition—though
                    not the weightiest—to my weighty griefs and sorrows. To show you that my sorrow
                    is not prostration, you have entered in your Chronicle the date of the visit of

                        raiding Oropus.</note> I want to know now the cause of its coming. I think
                    it was about Oropus: but I am not certain. And, if that is so, what was the

                    and the head of the Garden at Athens; also who were the famous politicians
                    there? I think you can find all those things in Apollodorus' book. It is
                    annoying about Attica; but, as it is a mild attack, I expect it will be all
                    right. About Gamala I had no doubt. For why was his father Ligus so fortunate?
                    Need I mention my own case, when I am incapable of getting relief, though
                    everything I wish were to happen. The price you mention for Drusus' gardens I
                    too had heard, and had written about it to you, yesterday I think. Whatever the
                    price is, what is necessary is cheap. In my eyes, whatever you may think—for I
                    know what I think of myself—it relieves my mind of a bounden duty, if not of
                    sorrow. I have written to Sicca, because he is intimate with L. Cotta. If
                    nothing can be managed about gardens across the Tiber, Cotta has some at Ostia
                    in </p>

                <p> a very public place. They are cramped for room, but more than sufficient for
                    this purpose. Please think of that. But don't be afraid of the price you mention
                    for the gardens. I don't want plate or raiment or any pleasant places now: I
                    want this. I see, too, who can help me. But speak to Silius; you can't do
                    better. I have given Sicca a commission too. He answered that he has made an
                    appointment with him. So he will write and tell me what he has done, and you
                    will see to it. <milestone unit="section" n="24"/>XXIV CICERO TO ATTICUS,

                    changed at Athens or whether he must take it with him; and as regards the whole
                    matter please consider how and when you think he ought to go. Whether Publilius
                    is going to Africa and when, you can find out from Aledius. Please enquire and
                    let me know. And, to return to my own nonsense, please inform me whether P.
                    Crassus, the son of Venuleia, died in the lifetime of his father, P. Crassus the
                    ex-consul, as I seem to remember, or after his death. I also want to know
                    whether my recollection is right that Regillus, son of Lepidus, died in his
                    father's lifetime. You must settle the business about Cispius and Precius. As to

                    reported the matter to you; and you say the same in your letter. I am pleased
                    with the property and the conditions, except that I would rather pay money down
                    than assign property at a valuation. Silius will not want show places and I can
                    make myself contented on the income I have, though hardly on less. So where can
                    I get ready money? You can extort 5,000 guineas<note type="footnote" n="1"

                    it will be necessary; and I find I have another 5,000 by me. For the rest of the
                    money I will either pay interest to Silius, until I get it from Faberius, or get
                    the money to pay with at once from some debtor of Faberius. There will be some
                    coming in too from other quarters. But you can take charge of the whole matter.
                    I much prefer them to Drusus' gardens; indeed the two have never been compared.
                    Believe me I am actuated by one single motive. I know I have gone silly about
                    it; but continue to bear with my folly. For it is no use your talking about a

                    and it is because Sicca can content himself with that, that I am the more eager
                    for his visit. Besides you know how delicate our Nicias is, and his luxurious
                    way of living. So why should I want to put him to inconvenience, when he cannot
                    give me any pleasure? However I am grateful to him for wishing it. There is one

                    Silius, I know the terms well enough, but I expect to hear full details from
                    Sicca to-day. Cotta's place, which you say you don't know, is beyond Silius'
                    house, which I think you know. It is a shabby little house and very tiny, with
                    no ground, and not big enough for anything except the purpose for which I
                    require it. I am looking for a public position. But, if the matter is being
                    settled about Silius' gardens,—that is, if you settle it, for it rests entirely
                    with you—there is no reason for thinking of Cotta. About my son I will do as you

                    is necessary. If you have been able to get anything out of Aledius, as you say,
                    write and tell me. I gather from your letter, and certainly you will from mine,
                    that we have nothing to say to each other—the same old things day after day,
                    though they are long ago worn threadbare. Still I cannot help sending to you
                    every day to get a letter from you. However tell me about Brutus, if you have
                    any information. For I suppose he knows now where to expect Pansa. If, as is
                    generally the case, on the border of his province, he ought to be here about the
                    first of the month. I wish it were later; for there are plenty of reasons why I
                    shun the city. So I am even wondering whether I should make some excuse to him.
                    I could do so easily enough. But there is plenty of time to think about it. My

                    Silius I have learned nothing more from Sicca now he is here than from his
                    letter, for he had written quite fully. So if you meet him, write and tell me
                    your views. As to the matter on which you think a message has been sent to me, I
                    don't know whether one has been sent or not; certainly not a word has been said
                    to me. So go on as you have begun, and, if you come to any arrangement that
                    satisfies her, which I don't think at all likely, take my son with you to her,
                    if you like. It is to his interest to appear to have wanted to do something to </p>

                <p> please her; I have no interest in the matter, except that you know of, which I
                    consider important. You call me back to my old way of life. Well, I have long
                    been bewailing the loss of the Republic, and that was what 1 was doing, though
                    less strongly; for I had one harbour of refuge. Now I positively cannot follow
                    my old way of life and employment; nor do I think I ought to care what others
                    think about that. My own conscience is more to me than all their talk. For the
                    consolation I have sought in writing, I am not discontented with my measure of
                    success. It has made me show my grief less; but the grief itself I could not
                    lessen, nor would I, if I could. About Triarius you interpret my wishes well.
                    However do nothing without his family's consent. I love him, though he is dead:
                    I am guardian to his children, and feel affection for all his household. As
                    regards the business with Castricius, if he is willing to take money estimated
                    at its present rate instead of the slaves, nothing could be more convenient.
                    But, if things have gone so far that he is taking the slaves away, I don't think
                    it is fair to him to ask him (you ask me to give you my real opinion); for I
                    don't want my brother Quintus to have any bother, and I rather fancy you take
                    the same view. If Publilius is waiting for the equinox, as you say Aledius tells
                    you, I suppose he is going by sea; but he told me he was going by way of Sicily.
                    I should like to know which it is and when. I should like you too some time at
                    your convenience to pay a visit to little Lentulus<note type="footnote" n="1">1

                    meeting. I am not trying to avoid Brutus, though I don't expect to get any
                    consolation from him. But there are reasons why I do not want to go there at
                    this particular time. If those reasons continue to exist, I shall have to find
                    some excuse to offer him, and by the look of things at present, I think they
                    will continue. As for the gardens, please finish the business. The main point is
                    what you know. A further consideration is that I myself want something of the
                    kind; for I cannot exist in a crowd, nor can I be far from you. For my purpose I
                    cannot see anything better adapted than that particular place, and I should like
                    to know what your opinion is. I am quite sure, especially as I see you think so
                    too, that Oppius and Balbus are very fond of me. Let them know how eager I am
                    for the gardens and why; but that it is only possible, if the business with
                    Faberius is settled; and ask whether they will go bail for the payment. Even if
                    I must bear some loss in return for getting ready money, draw them on as far as
                    they will go: for there is no chance of getting the full debt. In fact, find out
                    if they show any inclination to assist my plan. If they do, it is a great
                    assistance; if not, we must manage somehow or other. Look upon it as "a place to
                    grow old in," to use your own phrase, or if you like as a burial place for me.
                    It is no use thinking of the place at Ostium. If we don't get this, I feel sure,
                    we shall not get Lamia's; so we must try for Damasippus' place. </p>

                    consent to do so, indeed it is more convenient than for me to write to Clodius
                    myself, as he wanted. As to Castricius' slaves I think it is most convenient

                    been in them; I know Coponius' country house is old and not very large and the
                    wood a fine one; but I don't know what either brings in, and that I think we
                    ought to know. But for me either of them should be reckoned rather by my need
                    than by the market value. However please consider whether I can get them or not.
                    If I were to sell my claim on Faberius, I should have no doubt about settling
                    for Silius' gardens even with ready money, if only he could be induced to sell.
                    If his are not for sale, I should have recourse to Drusus, even at the price
                    Egnatius said he asked. Hermogenes too can be a great assistance to me in
                    getting ready money. You must not mind my being eager, one ought to be when one

                    they will come to me—is the very thing I want to avoid, and the one way of
                    avoiding it is for me to flee. I don't want to, but I must. Now I want you to
                    find out how long I can stay without being caught. Act as you say, with
                    moderation. Please suggest to my son, that is if you think it fair, that he
                    should keep the expenses of this journey within the rents of my property in the
                    Argiletum and the Aventine, with which he would have been quite contented, if he
                    stayed in Rome and hired a house, as he was thinking of doing: and, when you
                    have made the suggestion, I should like you to arrange the rest, so that we may
                    supply him with what is necessary from those rents. I will guarantee that
                    neither Bibulus nor Acidinus nor Messalla, who I hear are at Athens, will spend
                    more than he will get out of those rents. So please see who the tenants are and
                    what they pay, secondly that they are punctual payers, and what journey money
                    and outfit will suffice. There is certainly no need of a carriage at Athens,
                    while for what he wants on the journey, we have more than enough, as you also
                    observe. <milestone unit="section" n="33"/>XXXIII CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.

                    forbid me to entertain that suspicion. So take care of her. I can write no more.

                    anxious to avoid its being taken for a tomb, not so much on account of the legal
                    penalty as to get as near to deification as possible. That would be possible, if
                    it were in the actual house where she died; but, as I have often said, I am
                    afraid of its changing hands. Wherever I build it in the open, I think I can
                    contrive that posterity shall respect its sanctity. You must put up with these
                    foolish fancies of mine, for such I confess they are; for there is no one, not

                    for the reason he gave you. For when I come to think of it, I don't think he
                    could have done anything ruder. If you think we ought to go on with our idea
                    about the shrine, I should like you to speak to Cluatius and spur him on. For,
                    even if we decide on another place, I think we must make use of his labour and

                    too, which only reached me on the thirteenth day. I am forwarding the letter
                    itself and a copy of my answer. About the shrine, if you don't get me any
                    gardens —and you ought, if you love me as much as I know you do—I approve highly
                    of your scheme about the place at Tusculum. In spite of your acute powers of
                    thought so bright an idea would never have come into your head, unless you had
                    been very anxious for me to secure what I was very much bent on having. But

                <p> Scapula's are the most public, and besides they are near and one can be there
                    without spending the whole day in the country. So before you go away, I should
                    very much like you to see Otho, if he is in town. If it comes to nothing, I
                    shall go to such lengths as to rouse your wrath, accustomed though you are to my
                    folly. For Drusus certainly is willing to sell. So, if there is nothing else, it
                    will be my fault if I don't buy. Pray see that I don't make any mistake about
                    it. The only way of making sure against that is to get some of Scapula's land,
                    if possible. Please let me know, too, how long you are going to be in your
                    suburban estate. With Terentia her liking for you may help as much as your
                    influence. But do as you think fit. For I know that you are generally more

                    the most cultivated and the one most worthy of a man of learning. But, when I am

                    you are as much concerned about as myself. I regard it as a debt and I cannot
                    lay aside my care, till I have paid it or see that I can pay it, that is, till I
                    have found a suitable place. If Scapula's heirs are thinking of dividing his
                    garden into four parts and bidding for them among themselves, as you say Otho
                    has told you, then there is no chance for a purchaser; but, if they put them up
                    for sale, we will see what we can do. For that place of Publicius', which now
                    belongs to Trebonius and Cusinius, has been offered to me; but you know it is a
                    mere building plot. I can't put up with it at any price. Clodia's gardens I
                    like, but I don't think they are for sale. Though you dislike Drusus' gardens, I
                    shall have to come back to them, unless you find something. The building does
                    not bother me. I shall only be building what I shall build in any case, even if
                    I don't have the gardens. I am as pleased with " Cyrus, Books IV. and V." as

                    Not to be prostrated? No one was ever less prostrated. While I sought relief in
                    your house, I was at home to every caller; and no one, who came, felt in the
                    way. I came to Astura straight from you. Those cheerful friends of yours who
                    blame me cannot read as much as I have written. How well it is written is not to
                    the point, but it was a kind of writing that no one whose spirit was broken
                    could do. I have been thirty days in these gardens. Who has failed to get access
                    to me or conversation with me? At this very moment I am writing and reading so
                    much that the people with me find the holiday harder work than I find working.
                    If anyone asks why I am not in town, " because it is the vacation ": why I am

                    put up with the crowd of visitors." So I am staying where the man, who prized
                    Baiae more than anyone, always used to spend this part of the year. When I come
                    to Rome, they shall have nothing to find fault with in my looks or my

                    in my bearing or my words. As to Scapula's gardens, it seems possible that, as a
                    favour, partly to you and partly to me, they may be put up at auction. If not,

                        >Astura, May 11, B.C. 45</note> I have nothing to write. But I want to know,
                    where you are; and, if you are away or are going away, when you will return. So
                    please send me word. You wanted to know, when I am leaving here: I have made up
                    my mind to stay at Lanuvium on the 16th, and then at Tusculum or at Rome on the
                    next day. Which I am going to do, you shall know on the day itself. You know how
                    full of grievances misfortune makes one. I have none against you; but still I
                    have a hungry longing for the shrine. I will venture to say so much, and you
                    must take it as you usually do, that unless I see it being built, 1 don't say
                    finished, my resentment will redound on you, quite unjustly, but you will put up
                    with what I am saying, as you put up with all my moods and always have put up
                    with them. 1 wish you would confine your attempts at consolation to that one
                    point. If you want to know my wishes, I choose Scapula's place </p>

                <p> first, and then Clodia's: after them, if Silius won't agree and Drusus acts
                    unfairly, Cusinius' and Trebonius' property. I think there is a third owner: I
                    know for certain that Rebilus was one. If however you prefer my place at
                    Tusculum, as you hinted in a letter, I will agree. Get the thing finished
                    somehow, if you want to see me consoled. You are blaming me already more
                    severely than is your wont, but you do it most affectionately, and I suppose it
                    is my fault for making you do so. However, if you wish to see me consoled, this
                    is the best consolation, or rather, to tell the truth, the only one. If you have
                    read Hirtius' letter, which seems to me a sort of first sketch of the tirade
                    Caesar has written against Cato, let me know what you think of it, if you can. I
                    return to the shrine. If it is not finished this summer (and we have the whole
                    summer before us), I shall not think myself free from guilt. <milestone

                    to know. So on the 10th I got your letter with nothing in it. For what was there

                    But you say something or other about Clodia. Where is she then or when is she
                    coming? I prefer her grounds to anyone's except Otho's. But I don't think she
                    will sell: she likes the place and has plenty of money: and how difficult the
                    other thing is, you are well aware. But pray let us make an effort to think out
                    some way of getting what I want. I think of leaving here on the 16th; but either
                    for Tusculum or for Rome, and then on perhaps to Arpinum. When I know for

                    occurred to me to advise you to do exactly what you are doing. For I thought you
                    could get that particular business over more conveniently at home without any
                    fear of interruption. As I said before, I intend to stop at Lanuvium on the
                    16th, and then either at Rome or Tusculum. You shall know in advance which. You
                    are right in saying that will lighten my sorrow, but believe me it will do so to
                    an extent which you cannot imagine. How eagerly I desire it you can judge from

                    it. I have doubts about Otho, perhaps because I am eager for his place. But

                <p> cially when we have to bid against a man, who is eager for the place, wealthy
                    and one of his heirs. What I should prefer after that is Clodia's. But, k if
                    nothing can be done about those, do anything. J I count myself more bound by

                        <note type="margin">Astura, May 13, B.C. 45</note> I am not at all annoyed
                    that Hirtius wrote to you May about me in a sympathetic tone (he was acting
                    kindly), and still less at your not sending his letter to me, in which you were
                    acting even more kindly. The reason why I want your copyists to circulate the
                    book he sent me about Cato, is that their abuse may enhance Cato's reputation.
                    You say you are negotiating through Mustela. He is a very suitable person and
                    very devoted to me since the affair of Pontianus. So get something settled. But
                    what is wanted except an opening for a purchaser? And that could be got through
                    any of the heirs. But I think Mustela will manage that, if you ask him. You will
                    have provided me not only with the very place I want for my purpose, but a place
                    to grow old in besides. For Silius' and Drusus' places don't seem to me quite
                    fit for a paterfamilias. Why, I should have to spend whole days in the country
                    house. So I prefer the others, Otho's first and then Clodia's. If nothing comes
                    of it, then we must play a trick on Drusus or fall back on the place at
                    Tusculum. </p>

                    business over and let me find you with some leisure again. As I saic 1 before, I
                    am going from here to Lanuvium on the 16th, then on the 17th to Tusculum. For I
                    have crushed down my feelings and perhaps have conquered them, if only it will
                    last. So you shall hear to-morrow perhaps, at the latest the day after. But what
                    is this, pray? Philotimus says Pompey is not shut in at Carteia (about that
                    Oppius and Balbus had sent me a copy of a letter to Clodius of Patavium, saying
                    they thought he was) and that there is quite an important war yet to come. Of

                    husband saying that, through going bail for Flaminius, Montanus owes Plancus
                    nearly £200;<note type="footnote" n="1">1 20,000 sesterces.</note> and that he
                    has made some request to you about it I should like you to assist him by
                    speaking to Plancus or in any other way you can. I feel under an obligation to
                    help him. If you know more about it than I do, or if you think Plancus should be
                    spoken to, I wish you would write to me, that I may know how the matter stands,
                    and what I ought to ask him. I am awaiting news as to what you have done about
                    the letter to Caesar. About Silius I am not much concerned. You must get me
                    either Scapula's or Clodia's gardens. But you seem to have some doubts about
                    Clodia. Is it about the date of her arrival or as to whether the gardens are for
                    sale? But what is this that I hear about Spinther divorcing his wife? </p>

                    accidere posset? Omnia igitur metuenda. Sed illud παρὰ τὴν ἱστορίαν, tu
                    praesertim, me reliquum consularem. Quid? tibi Servius quid videtur? Quamquam
                    hoc nullam ad partem valet scilicet, mihi praesertim, qui non minus bene actum
                    cum illis putem. Quid enim sumus aut quid esse possumus? domin an foris?
                    Quodnisi mihi hoc venisset in mentem, scribere ista nescio quae, quo verterem
                    me, non haberem. Ad Dolabellam, ut scribis, ita puto faciendum, κοινότερα
                    quaedam et πολιτικώτερα. Faciendum certe aliquid est; valde enim desiderat.
                    Brutus si quid egerit, curabis, ut sciam; cui quidem quam primum agendum puto,

                    Sed haec ipse optime, praesertim si etiam tecum loquetur. Mihi est in animo
                    proficisci XI Kal. Hic enim nihil habeo, quod agam, ne hercule illic quidem nec
                    usquam, sed tamen aliquid illic. Hodie Spintherem exspecto. Misit enim Brutus ad
                    me. Per litteras purgat Caesarem de interitu Marcelli; in quem, ne si insidiis
                    quidem ille interfectus esset, caderet ulla suspicio. Nunc vero, cum de Magio
                    constet, nonne furor eius causam omnem sustinet? Plane, quid sit, non intellego.
                    Explanabis igitur. Quamquam nihil habeo, quod dubitem, nisi, ipsi Magio quae
                    fuerit causa amentiae; pro quo quidem etiam sponsor sum factus. Et nimirum id
                    fuit. Solvendo enim non erat. Credo eum petisse a Marcello aliquid, et illum, ut
                    erat, constantius respondisse. <milestone unit="section" n="11"/>XI CICERO

                    Valde me momorderunt epistulae tuae de Attica nostra; eaedem tamen sanaverunt.
                    Quod enim te ipse consolabare eisdem litteris, id mihi erat satis firmum ad
                    leniendam aegritudinem. Ligarianam praeclare vendidisti. Posthac, quicquid
                    scripsero, tibi praeconium deferam. Quod ad me de Varrone scribis, scis me antea
                    orationes aut aliquid id genus solitum scribere, ut Varronem nusquam possem
                    intexere. Postea autem quam haec coepi φιλολογώτερα, iam Varro mihi
                    denuntiaverat magnam sane et gravem προσφώνησιν. Biennium praeteriit, eum ille
                    Καλλιππίδης adsiduo cursu cubitum nullum processerat, ego autem me parabam ad
                    id, quod ille mihi misisset, ut " αὐτῷ τῷ μέτρῳ καὶ λώϊον," si modo potuissem.
                    Nam hoc etiam Hesiodus ascribit, " αἴ κε δύνηαι." Nunc illam περὶ τελῶν σύνταξιν

                <p> Bruto, ut tibi placuit, despondimus, idque eum non nolle mihi scripsisti. Ergo
                    illam Ἀκαδημικήν, in qua homines nobiles illi quidem, sed nullo modo philologi
                    nimis acute loquuntur, ad Varronem transferamus. Etenim sunt Antiochia, quae
                    iste valde probat. Catulo et Lucullo alibi reponemus, ita tamen, si tu hoc

                    ut mihi tacendum fuerit. Crassus enim loquitur, Antonius, Catulus senex, C.
                    Iulius, frater Catuli, Cotta, Sulpicius. Puero me hic sermo inducitur, ut nullae

                    Ita confeci quinque libros περὶ τελῶν, ut Epicurea L. Torquato, Stoica M.
                    Catoni, περιπατητικὰ M. Pisoni darem. Ἀζηλοτύπητον id fore putaram, quod omnes

                    ipsum capere potuerit. Hac de re igitur exspecto litteras tuas. Varroni scribis
                    te, simul ac venerit. Dati igitur iam sunt, nec tibi integrum est, hui, si
                    scias, quanto periculo tuo! Aut fortasse litterae meae te retardarunt; nisi eas
                    nondum legeras, cum has proximas scripsisti. Scire igitur aveo, quo modo res se
                    habeat. De Bruti amore vestraque ambulatione etsi mihi nihil novi adfers, sed
                    idem quod saepe, tamen hoc audio libentius quo saepius, eoque mihi iucundius
                    est, quod tu eo laetaris, certiusque eo est, quod a te dicitur. </p>

                    proscribenda equidem locutus sum cum Balbo. Placebat (puto conscripta habere
                    Offilium omnia; habet et Balbus) sed Balbo placebat propinquum diem et Romae; si
                    Caesar moraretur, posse diem differri. Sed is quidem adesse videtur. Totum
                    igitur considera; placet enim Vestorio. </p>

                    Nam ad patrem de me quid scripserit, nescio, de matre quam pie! " Volueram,"
                    inquit, "ut quam plurimum tecum essem, conduci mihi domum et id ad te

                    non possum; qua de causa, scis." Hanc autem causam pater odium matris esse
                    dicebat. Nunc me iuva, mi Attice, consilio, “πότερον δίκᾳ τεῖχος ὕψιον,” di est

                    used just the right amount of severity and of moderation in your letter to my
                    son, and it was exactly as I should have wished it to be. Your notes, too, to
                    the Tullii<note type="footnote" n="1">1 L. Tullius Montanus and M. Tullius
                        Marcianus, who were at Athens with Cicero's son.</note> were full of good
                    advice. So either those letters will set things right or we shall have to try
                    some other means. As to the money, I see you are making every effort, or rather
                    you have done so already. If you manage it, I shall owe the gardens to you.
                    Indeed, there is no other kind of property I should prefer, especially for the
                    matter I have in hand. You remove my impatience by your promise, or rather your
                    pledge, about the summer. There is nothing either that could be found more
                    likely to solace my declining years and my sorrow. My eagerness for it impels me
                    at times to urge you to haste. But I restrain myself, for I have no doubt that,
                    as you know I want it very much, your eagerness more than equals mine. So I
                    count the matter as already settled. I am waiting to hear what your friends
                    decide about the letter to Caesar. Nicias is as devoted to you, as he ought to
                    be, and is highly delighted at your remembering him. I am extremely fond of </p>

                    himself as much as I loved his father; and you most of all for trying to promote
                    this feeling between us. If you see the gardens, and if you let me know about
                    the letter, you will supply me with something to write about; but, anyhow, I

                    character of public host, has monopolized him; and I am not sorry for it.

                    must make the best of them as they are. Sometime you would have had to go bail
                    for me even in this sale.<note type="footnote" n="2">2 i.e. even in the purchase

                    delay in collecting the money, if only I get what I want, I think I can arrange
                    for delay with the auctioneer or at any rate with the heirs. See about Crispus
                    and Mustela, and I should like to know what the share of the two is. I had heard
                    already of Brutus' arrival, for my freedman Aegypta had brought me a letter from
                    him. I have -.ent it to you, as it is obligingly written. <milestone

                    who died lately, often used to recite to me letters Mummius wrote to his friends
                    from Corinth in clever verse. But I have no doubt he was a special legate to his
                    brother, not among the ten ambassadors. Here is another point too that I have
                    been taught, that it was not the custom of our ancestors to appoint among the
                    ten ambassadors anyone who was related to the generals, as we in ignorance of,
                    or rather in contempt for, the soundest institutions did in sending M. Lucullus
                    and L. Murena and others to L. Lucullus. But it was most natural that he should
                    be among the first of his brother's legates. What a lot of work you get through,
                    attending to points like this, managing my affairs and bestowing nearly as much

                    a call, but he stayed at my invitation. Trebatius is with me too, and this
                    morning came Dolabella. We had a long talk till late in the day. I cannot
                    exaggerate his cordiality and friendliness. However, we touched on young
                    Quintus. Much of what he told me was unmentionable, unspeakable; but there was
                    one thing so bad that, if the whole army did not know of it, I should not dare
                    to dictate it to Tiro or even to write it down myself. But enough of this.
                    Torquatus came to me opportunely, while Dolabella was with me, and Dolabella
                    very kindly repeated to him what I had just been saying. For I had just been
                    pleading his cause very earnestly; and my earnestness seemed to please Torquatus
                    greatly. I am waiting to know if you have any news about Brutus. However, Nicias
                    thought that the matter was settled, but that the divorce was not approved. For
                    that reason I am all the more eager about the thing, as you are too. For, if any
                    offence has been given, this can remedy it. I must go to Arpinum. For my little

                    sorts of new dangers. For who would have feared this? Such a thing never
                    happened before and it did not seem as though nature could allow such things to
                    happen. So one may fear anything. But fancy you of all people making such a
                    historical slip as to call me the only surviving ex-consul. Why, what about
                    Servius? However, that of course has not the slightest importance in any
                    respect, least of all to me, who think my dead comrades' fate quite as happy as
                    my own. For what am I or what can I be? Am I anything in private life or in
                    public? If it had not occurred to me to write my books, such as they are, I
                    should not know what to do with myself. I think I must follow your advice and
                    dedicate something more general and more political to Dolabella. 1 must
                    certainly do something for him, as he is very anxious for it. If Brutus makes
                    any move, pray let me know. I think he ought to make one as soon as possible,
                    especially if he has made up his mind.<note type="footnote" n="2">2 About his

                    thinking of setting out on the 21st, for I have nothing to do here, and precious
                    little to do there or anywhere else; still there is something to do there.
                    To-day I am expecting Spinther, for Brutus has sent him to me. He writes to
                    exculpate Caesar of Marcellus' death. But no suspicion would have fallen on
                    Caesar, even if his death had been due to treachery; and now that Magius is
                    known to be mad, surely that accounts for everything. I don't see his point at
                    all. Perhaps you will explain. However, there is nothing I am in doubt about
                    except the reason for Magius' madness; why, I had even gone security for him.
                    That no doubt was the point; he was insolvent. I suppose he asked some favour of
                    Marcellus, and the latter, as was his way, gave a rather decided answer.

                    from its eminent interlocutors and transferred it to our friend: and from two
                    books I have turned it into four. They are certainly finer than the first draft
                    though a good deal has been cut out. But I should very much like you to tell me
                    how you knew Varro wanted it: and one thing at any rate I want to know, who </p>


                <pb n="133"/>
                <p> was it of whom you noticed he was jealous: unless perhaps it was Brutus. Upon my
                    word that is the only possible answer:<note type="footnote" n="1">1 Or "that is
                        the last straw," or "the height of absurdity."</note> but still I should
                    much like to know. Unless I am deceived like most people by egotism, the books
                    have turned out superior to anything of the kind even in Greek. You must not be
                    annoyed at the loss you have incurred in having the part of the Academica you
                    have copied in vain. The new draft will be far finer, shorter, and better. But
                    now I don't know where to turn. I want to do something for Dolabella, as he is
                    very anxious for it. But I can't think of anything, and at the same time " I
                    fear the Trojans,"<note type="footnote" n="2">2 i.e. public opinion. Cf. Aft.
                        ii. 5.</note> and even if I can think of something, I shall not escape
                    criticism. So I must either be idle or rack my brains for something. But why do
                    I bother about trifles like this? Pray tell me how dear Attica is. I am very
                    anxious about her. But I keep dipping into your letter again and again, and that
                    solaces me. Nevertheless I am looking forward to a fresh one. Brinnius'
                    freedman, my co-heir, has written to me that the rest of the heirs want him and
                    Sabinus Albius to come to me, if I am willing. I am all against that: it is more
                    than the legacy is worth. However, they can easily manage to attend the auction,
                    which is on the 13th, if they meet me at my place at Tusculum early on the 8th.
                    But, if they want to put off the date still further, they can do so two or three
                    days or as much as they like: it does not matter to me. So, unless the people
                    have started already, stop them. If Brutus has done anything, or if you have any
                    news about Caesar or anything else, let me know.</p>

                    CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING. <note type="margin">Arpinum, June 27, B.C 45</note>
                    Please give your earnest consideration to deciding whether what 1 have written
                    ought to be sent to Varro: though the point has some personal interest for you
                    too: for you must know I have brought you in as a third speaker in the dialogue.
                    So I think we must consider. The names, however, have been entered, but they can
                    be scratched out or altered. Pray tell me how Attica is. It is three days since
                    I heard from you, and no wonder: for no one has come here, and perhaps there was
                    no reason for writing. So I myself have nothing to write. However, I am
                    expecting one of my messengers the very day I am giving this to Valerius. If he
                    comes and brings something from you, I foresee I shall have no lack of material.

                    streams and solitude, to make life more endurable, at present I have not stirred
                    a foot away from the house; we have had such heavy and continuous rain. The
                    "Academic Treatise " I have transferred entirely to Varro. At first it was
                    assigned to Catulus, Lucullus, and Hortensius; then, as that seemed
                    inappropriate because they were well-known not to be up in such matters, though
                    not illiterate, as soon as I came here I transferred the conversations to Cato
                    and Brutus. Then came your letter about Varro and he seemed the most appropriate
                    person possible to air Antiochus' </p>

                <p> views. However, I should like you to write whether you approve of dedicating
                    anything to him, and, if you do, whether you approve of this particular book.
                    What about Servilia? Has she come? Has Brutus done anything, and when? What news
                    of Caesar? I shall arrive on the 7th of July, as I said. Make some arrangement
                    with Piso, if you can. <milestone unit="section" n="17"/>XVII, <milestone

                        type="margin">Arpinum, June 29, B.C. 45</note> I was expecting some news
                    from Rome on the 27th. Then I should have given some orders to your men. Now I
                    have only the same old questions, What is Brutus thinking of doing, or, if he
                    has done anything, has any comment come from Caesar? But why do I ask about
                    these things, when I care very little about them? I do want to know how our dear
                    Attica is getting on. Though your letter (but that is quite out of date now)
                    bids me be hopeful, still I am anxious for fresh news. You see the advantage of
                    being near at hand. Certainly let us settle about the gardens. We seemed to be
                    talking to one another, when I was at Tusculum, so frequent was the interchange
                    of letters. But that will be the same again soon. Meantime I have taken your
                    hint and finished off some really quite clever books for Varro. But I am waiting
                    for your answer to my questions: first, how you knew he wanted anything from me,
                    when in spite of his voluminous writings he has never challenged me; and next,
                    who it was of whom he was jealous, unless it may have been Brutus. If he is not
                    jealous of him, he certainly cannot be of Hortensius or the speakers in the De </p>


                <pb n="139"/>
                <p> Republica. I should like you to make this quite clear to me, especially whether
                    you abide by your opinion that I should send him what I have written, or whether
                    you think it is unnecessary. But of this when we meet. <milestone unit="section"

                        30, B.C 45</note> The copyist Hilarus had just left on the 28th, and I had
                    given him a letter to you, when your messenger came with your letter of the day
                    before. What I was most glad to see in it was the sentence " Our dear Attica
                    begs you not to be anxious " and your own statement that there is no danger. I
                    see your influence has given my speech for Ligarius a good start. For Balbus has
                    written to me with Oppius, saying that he is extraordinarily pleased with it;
                    and for that reason he has sent the little thing to Caesar. So that is what you
                    wrote to me some time ago. In Varro's case I should not be disturbed about
                    appearing to be tuft-hunting—for my principle has always been not to insert any
                    living characters in my dialogues; but it was because you say Varro wants it,
                    and appreciates the compliment, that I have finished off the work and have
                    comprised the whole of the Academic philosophy—how well I cannot say, but with
                    all possible care—in four books. All the fine array of arguments against the
                    uncertainty of apperceptions collected by Antiochus I have given to Varro; I
                    answer him myself, and you are the third speaker in our conversation. If I had
                    made Cotta and Varro carry on the argument between them, as you suggest in your
                    last letter, I</p>


                <pb n="141"/>
                <p> should have been a mere lay figure. That suits admirably when the characters are
                    persons of olden times; and that is what Heraclides often did in his works; and
                    I myself did so in my six books De Republica. It is the same, too, in my three
                    books De Oratore, of which I think very highly; in them, too, the characters
                    were such that I could properly keep silent. For the speakers are Crassus,
                    Antonius, old Catulus, his brother C. Julius, Cotta and Sulpicius; and the
                    conversation is supposed to take place when I was a boy, so that I could have no
                    part in it. But in a modern work, I follow Aristotle's practice: the
                    conversation of the others is so put forward as to leave him the principal part.
                    I arranged the five books De Finibus so as to give the Epicurean parts to L.
                    Torquatus, the Stoic to M. Cato, and the Peripatetic to M. Piso. I thought that
                    could not make anybody jealous, as they were all dead. This present work, the
                    Academica, as you know, I had shared between Catulus, Lucullus and Hortensius. I
                    must admit that the work did not suit the characters; for it was far too
                    philosophical for them to have ever dreamt of such things. So, when I read your
                    note about Varro, I jumped at it as a godsend. Nothing could have been more
                    appropriate for expounding the system of philosophy in which he seems to be
                    specially interested, and for introducing a part which prevents me from seeming
                    to give my own cause the superiority. For the views of Antiochus are very
                    persuasive, and I have put them carefully with all Antiochus' acuteness and my
                    own polished style, if I possess one. But do you consider carefully, whether you
                    think I ought to dedicate the books to Varro. Some objections occur to me; but
                    of that when we meet. </p>

                        type="margin">Arpinum, July 2 or 3, B.C. 45</note> I have received a letter
                    of consolation from Caesar, posted on the last of April at Hispalis. I did not
                    understand what the proposals for improving the city are; and I should much like
                    to know. I am not displeased that Torquatus is satisfied with my attentions, and
                    I shall not cease to increase them. To the speech for Ligarius I cannot add
                    anything now about Tubero's<note type="footnote" n="1" place="opposite">1 Tubero

                    speech is widely circulated, and I do not wish to offend Tubero; for he is most
                    touchy. You certainly had a good audience. Though I am happy enough here, I am
                    longing to see you; so I shall come as arranged. I think you have met my
                    brother; so I am anxious to know what happened. About my reputation I don't care
                    a straw; though I did once write to you foolishly that there was nothing better;
                    for it is not worth bothering about. And see what deep philosophy there is in
                    this other sentiment of mine, "In all one's life one ought not to stray a nail's
                    breadth from the straight path of conscience." Do you think I am engaged in
                    philosophical treatises for nothing? I should be sorry for you to distress
                    yourself about a mere nothing. Now I come back to my point. Do you suppose I
                    care for anything in the whole matter, except that I should not be untrue to
                        it.<note type="footnote" n="2">2 The sense and the reading of this sentence

                        29, B.C. 45</note> I have sent a very bulky letter to Hirtius, which I wrote
                    lately at Tusculum. This letter which you have sent, I will answer later. Just
                    now I prefer other things. What can I do for Torquatus, unless I hear from
                    Dolabella? As soon as I hear, you shall know at once. I am expecting messengers
                    from him to-day or to-morrow at the latest; and, as soon as they come, they
                    shall be sent on to you. I am expecting to hear from Quintus. For when I was
                    starting from Tusculum on the 25th, as you know, I sent messengers to him. To
                    return to business, the word inhibere suggested by you, which at first took my
                    fancy very much, I strongly disapprove of now. For it is exclusively a nautical
                    word. That, however, I knew before; but I thought rowers rested on their oars,
                    when told to inhibere. Yesterday, when a ship put in by my house, I learned that
                    was not so. They don't rest on their oars, they back water. That is very
                    different to the Greek ἐποχή. So change the word back to what it was in the
                        book<note type="footnote" n="1">1 Academica n. 94. Ἐποχή, of which the Latin
                        rendering is here discussed, is the technical term in philosophy for
                        "suspension of judgment."</note>; and tell Varro to do </p>


                <pb n="147"/>
                <p> the same, if he has altered it. One can't improve on Lucilius: " Pull up chariot
                    and horses as a good driver oft does." And Carneades always compares the
                    philosopher's suspension of judgment (ἐποχή) to the guard of a boxer and the
                    pulling up of a charioteer. But the inhibitio of rowers implies motion, and
                    indeed the rather violent motion of rowing to back the boat. You see how much
                    more attention I pay to this than either to rumour or to Pollio. Let me know too
                    about Pansa, if anything definite is known, and I suppose it has come out, about
                    Critonius, if there is any news, and anyhow about Metellus and Balbinus.

                <p> I am in such a hurry to send what I have written to Varro, as you suggested,
                    that I have sent it already to Rome to be copied. If you like, you shall have it
                    at once. For I wrote to my copyist telling them to give your people leave to
                    copy, if you liked. Please keep it, however, till I see you. You are generally
                    most careful to do so, when I have told you. I was nearly forgetting to say that
                    Caerellia, inspired of course by love of philosophy, is copying from your
                        people<note type="footnote" n="1" place="opposite">1 Or " copies."</note>;
                    she has those very books De Finibus. I assure you, so far as it is humanly
                    possible to affirm anything, that she did not get it from mine, for my copy was
                    never out of my sight. So far were my people from making two copies, that they
                    could scarcely make up one. However, I am not finding any fault in your people,
                    and I hope you will not either, for I omitted to say that I did not want the
                    books circulated yet. Dear me, how I do harp on trifles. The fact is I have
                    nothing of importance to say. I agree about Dolabella. My co-heirs I will meet
                    at Tusculum, as you suggest. As to Caesar's arrival, Balbus has written that he
                    won't be here till the first of August. It is good news that Attica's attack
                    gets slighter and slighter and that she is bearing it cheerfully. As to that
                    idea of ours, about which I am quite as eager as you are, so far as 1 know
                    anything about the man, I approve of him, his family, and his fortune. What is
                    most important is that, though I do not know him himself, I hear very well of
                    him, even quite recently from Scrofa. If it is of any importance, one may add
                    that he is even better bred than his father. So we will speak of it when we
                    meet, and I am disposed to approve. For in addition, as I think you know, I am
                    with good reason and long have been fonder of his father than either you or he
                    himself is aware. </p>

                    are no hands in which I would rather have my writings than in yours, but I
                    should prefer them not to leave your hands till we have agreed on it. I acquit
                    your copyists of fault and I bring no charge against you; but there was
                    something different that I did mention in a letter, that Caerellia had some
                    things she could only have got from you. In Balbus' case I realize of course
                    that you had to satisfy him; only I am sorry that Brutus should get anything
                    stale or Balbus anything unfinished. I will send to Varro, as soon as I have
                    seen you, if you agree. Why I have hesitated, you shall know, when I do see you.

                    you say, for you would have known and told me. How- ever, you have written such

                <pb n="159"/>
                <p> Brutus was that I had gathered from your note that he did not wish me to come to
                    Rome now just to pay my respects to him—but, as you say you have read the
                    letter, perhaps I was not quite clear. However, as I am just on the point of
                    coming, please see that my presence on the 15th does not prevent his coming to
                    Tusculum at his convenience. For I shall not want him at the auction—surely in
                    such a business you alone will be enough: but I do want him when I make my will.
                    That I would rather postpone for another day now, so as not to seem to have come
                    to Rome expressly for that purpose. So I have written to Brutus now that I shall
                    not want him, as I had thought, on the 15th. I should like you to look after all
                    this and see that we don't inconvenience Brutus in the least. But what on earth
                    is the ^reason why you are so frightened at my bidding you send the books to
                    Varro on your own responsibility? Even now, if you have any doubts, let me know.
                    Nothing could be more finished than they are. I want Varro, especially as he
                    desires it: but, as you know, he is "a fearsome man; the blameless he would
                    blame." I often picture him to myself complaining of this perhaps, that my side
                    in the books is more fully defended than his own, though I assure you, if ever
                    you come to Epirus, I will convince you it is not. For at present I have to give
                    way to Alexio's<note type="footnote" n="1">1 Atticus' steward.</note> letters.
                    However, I don't despair of winning Varro's approval; and, as I have gone to the
                    expense of a large paper copy, I should like to stick to my plan. But I repeat
                    again, it must be on your responsibility. So, if you have doubts, let us change
                    to Brutus: he is also a </p>

                    desire for this. So I keep coming back to the idea of my place at Tusculum. For
                    anything is better than not getting it finished this summer. Under the present
                    circumstances I am as comfortable at Astura as I could be anywhere. But as those
                    who are with me are in a hurry to go home, I suppose because they cannot put up
                    with my melancholy, though I might remain, I shall leave here, as I told you, so
                    as not to seem deserted. But where am I to go? From Lanuvium I am trying to
                    bring myself to go to Tusculum. But I will let you know soon. Please write the
                    letters. You wouldn't believe how much writing I get done by night as well as
                    day, for I cannot sleep. Yesterday I even composed a letter to Caesar, as you
                    desired. There was no harm in writing it in case you thought it necessary: as </p>

                    However, I will send you a copy, perhaps from Lanuvium, unless I happen to come
                    to Rome. But you shall know to-morrow. <milestone unit="section" n="27"/>XXVII

                        45</note> As for the letter to Caesar, I was always ready to let your
                    friends read it first. If I had not been, I ' should not have done my duty by
                    them, and should ' very nearly have imperilled myself, if I were likely to
                    offend him. But they have acted frankly, and I am thankful to them for not
                    concealing their feelings; but the best thing of all is that they want to make
                    so many alterations that there is no sense in my writing it all over again.
                    However, what view ought I to have taken of the Parthian war except what I
                    thought he wanted? Indeed what other purpose had my letter save to kowtow to
                    him? Do you suppose I should have been at a loss for words, if I had wanted to
                    give him the advice which I really thought best? So the whole letter is
                    unnecessary. For, when I cannot make a coup, and a fiasco, however slight, would
                    be unpleasant, why should I run unnecessary risk? Especially as it occurs to me
                    that, as I have not written before, he would think I should not have written
                    until the whole war were over. Besides I am afraid he may think it is to sugar
                    the pill of my Cato. In fact I am very sorry I wrote it, and nothing could suit
                    my wishes better than that they do disapprove of my zeal. I should have fallen
                    foul of<note type="footnote" n="1" place="opposite">1 Or" come into contact

                    the subject of eternal fame, and they exhort him to follow honour. There is
                    plenty to say on that: but what can I say? However, from hard material I had
                    rough hewn something that seemed to me to take shape. Because there were a few
                    touches in it a little better than the actual facts past or present, fault is
                    found with them; and I don't regret it a bit. For, if the letter had reached its

                    though not against my advice. The rest I have written myself. When I was
                    discussing men of learning with Nicias, we chanced to speak of Talna. He had not
                    much to say for his intelligence, though he gave him a good and steady
                    character. But there was one thing that seemed to me unsatisfactory. He said he
                    knew he had lately sought in marriage Cornificia, Quintus' daughter, though
                    quite an old woman and married more than once before; but the ladies would not
                    agree as they found he was not worth more than 7,000 guineas.<note

                    the smaller could be made into a winter snuggery. So a covered passage would
                    have to be added, and, if I made one the same size as that at my place at
                    Tusculum, the cost would be about half as much in that district. However, for
                    the erection we want to make nothing could be more suitable than the grove,
                    which I used to know well; then it was not at all frequented, now I hear it is
                    very much so. There is nothing I should prefer. In this, humour my whim, in
                    heaven's name. For the rest, if Faberius pays that debt, don't bother about the
                    cost; I want you to outbid Otho: and I don't think he will bid wildly, for I
                    fancy I know the man. Besides I hear he has had such bad luck that I doubt if he
                    will buy. For would he put up with it, if he could help it?<note type="footnote"

                    price; if not, we cannot even at a low. So then we must fall back on Clodia. In
                    her case I see more grounds for hope, as her property is worth much less, and
                    Dolabella's debt seems so safe that I feel confident of being able to pay in

                    to you, when Eros arrived. But in his letter there was no news except that the

                    that he will not go against the Parthians until affairs are arranged here, is
                    what I advised in my letter. I told him he could do whichever he chose with my
                    full leave. For of course he wants that and won't do anything without my advice.
                    For heaven's sake let us give up flattery and be at least half-free; and that we
                    can manage by keeping quiet and out of sight. But approach Otho, as you say, and

                    away from the forum and yet being with you. As to the price, this has just
                    occurred to me. The nearest neighbour is C. Albanius. He bought some 600
                        acres<note type="footnote" n="2">2 1,000 jugera.</note> of M Pilius, so far

                    since he was at Corinth at the time and Hortensius was not speaking at random;
                    and I think you are right. You will be able to find out from Antiochus of course
                    in what year he was quaestor or military tribune. If he was neither, then he

                    that? " I said. " Why, I was going to the sale to buy Scapula's gardens, if I
                    could safely." "Don't you do it," he told me; "for the law will be passed:

                    enlarging the city, which he had never seen two years ago, and he thinks it too
                    small to hold the great man alone. On that point then I am expecting a letter
                    from you. You say you will present my book to Varro, as soon as he arrives. So
                    they are already given and you have no choice left. Ah, if you but knew what a
                    risk you are running! Or perhaps my letter stopped you, unless you had not read
                    it, when you wrote your last letter. So I am eager to know how the matter
                    stands. As to Brutus' affection and your walk, though you give me no actual
                    news, but only a repetition of what has often happened, yet the more often I
                    hear it, the gladder I am; and I find it the more gratifying, because you enjoy
                    it, and the more certain, because you tell me of it. </p>

                    could not happen more conveniently than you say they are happening in your
                    letter. Balbus the younger suggested the same to me the other day. I have no
                    news except that Hirtius has been taking my part most valiantly in arguments
                    against young Quintus. The latter is raving about me everywhere, especially at
                    dinner-parties, and then he falls back on his father: nothing he says is so
                    likely to be believed as that we are utterly irreconcilable to Caesar; that we
                    are not to be trusted, and that 1 ought to be held in suspicion, which would
                    have been terrifying, if were I not aware that the king knows I have no spirit
                    left. He says too that my son is being bullied by me: but that he may say as
                    much as he likes. I am glad I sent the funeral oration of Porcia to Lepta the
                    messenger before I got your letter. So, as you love me, have it sent to Domitius
                    and Brutus in the form you suggest, if it is to be sent at all. About the
                    gladiatorial games and the things which you call airy nothings send me news day
                    by day. I should like you to apply to Balbus and Offilius, if you think fit.
                    About giving notice of the auction I have spoken with Balbus. He agreed—I
                    imagine Offilius has a complete list, and so has Balbus—well Balbus agreed for a
                    day near at hand and for Rome as the place: if Caesar puts off coming, the day
                    might be deferred. But he seems to be close at hand. So think it all over; for
                    Vestorius is content. </p>

                    Epicureans before daybreak, I scribbled something or other to you circa by the
                    same lamp and at the same sitting and despatched it before daybreak. Then as I
                    was getting up with the sun after another sleep, I get a letter from your
                    sister's son, which I enclose. The beginning of it is most insulting: but
                    perhaps he did not stop to think. This is how it runs: " For, whatever there is
                    to be said to your discredit, I . . ." He wants me to understand there is plenty
                    to be said to my discredit, but he does not agree with it. Could anything be
                    more disgusting? You may read the rest (for I have sent it on) and judge for
                    yourself. I fancy it is the daily and continual complimentary remarks which, as
                    I hear from many, our friend Brutus is making about us, which have provoked him
                    into writing something to me and to you—let me know if he has written to you.
                    For what he has written to his father about me I don't know: about his mother
                    how affectionately! " I should have liked," he says, "to be with you as much as
                    possible and to have a house taken for me somewhere: and so I told you. You took
                    no notice: so we shall not be together much: for I cannot bear the sight of your
                    house: you know why." His father tells me the reason is his hatred of his
                    mother. Now, Atticus, help me with your advice. "By honest means shall I the
                    high wall climb? "<note type="footnote" n="1">1 From a fragment of Pindar, as

                    divided cannot truly tell." The first would suit my character best, of course,
                    but the second perhaps the times. But take it I have made up my mind to do
                    whatever you have made up your mind to do. I am horribly afraid of being caught
                    at Tusculum. It would be more comfortable in company. At Astura then? What if
                    Caesar arrives unexpectedly? Please assist me with advice. I will do what you
                    decide. <milestone unit="section" n="39"/>XXXIX CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.

                    hypocrisy! To write to his father that "he had no home owing to his mother," and
                    to his mother a letter full of affection. His father however is already cooling
                    down and says the son has a right to be angry with him. But I will follow your
                    advice; for I see " crooked ways " are what you favour. I will come to Rome, as
                    you think I ought, though against my will; for I cannot tear myself from my
                    writing. You say I shall find Brutus on the way: of course, but without this
                    other reason that would not be strong enough to move me. For he has not come
                    from the place I. should wish, nor has he been long away or sent me any letter.
                    Still I should like to know the result of his whole journey. Please send me the
                    books I asked for before, especially Phaedrus On the Gods and On Pallas.</p>

                    not even the man who began the whole criminal business has a good word to say
                    for young Quintus. Indeed, I was beginning to be afraid that even Brutus was
                    fond of him; for in his letter to me he said, " But I wish you could have had a
                    taste of his tales." But when we meet, as you say. However, what do you advise?
                    Shall I fly to meet him or stay where I am? For my part I am glued to my books,
                    and I don't want to receive him here. I hear his father has gone to-day to Saxa

                    against him that I remonstrated with him. But I am capable of acting the "giddy

                    young Quintus had sent an amiable letter to his mother and none to you. He was
                    surprised at the first, but said it was his fault about you, as he had often
                    written in anger to his son about your unfairness to him. However, he said his

                    mouth. So I asked, why he had the blues. " Need you ask," said he, " when I have

                    Debt," said he, "and yet not enough money for the journey." At that point I
                    borrowed something from your style of eloquence: I held my tongue. Well, he went
                    on. " But what worries me most is my uncle." " Why? " said I. " Because he is
                    angry with me," he answered. " Why do you let him be so? " I said, " for I would
                    rather put it that way than say, Why do you make him angry? " "I will not let
                    him," he said, " for I will remove the reason." I replied, "Very right of you,
                    too; but, if it is not a serious matter, I should like to know what the reason
                    is." " Because my hesitation which wife I should take annoyed my mother, and
                    consequently him, too. Now nothing is worth that, and I will do anything they
                    like." " I hope you will have luck," I said, "and I approve of your resolution.
                    But when are you going to do it? " "The time doesn't matter to me," said he,
                    "since I have made up my mind to it." " Well, I think you ought to do it before
                    you go," I said. " You would oblige your father, too, by doing so." " I will do
                    as you advise," he said; and there the conversation ended. But, look here, you
                    know it is my birthday on the 3rd of January. So you must come. I was just

                    told him to make all preparations for the games and not let him hurry back for

                    GREETING. <note type="margin">Tusculum, Aug. 12, B.C. 45</note> Pollex, having
                    arranged to meet me on the 13th of August, has done so at Lanuvium on the 12th:
                    but he is a mere thumb, and not a pointing finger.<note type="footnote" n="1">1
                        In the Latin there is a play on the proper name, which I am unable to
                        reproduce in English.</note> So you must get your news from him himself. I
                    have met Balbus: for Lepta, being anxious about the contract for the shows, took
                    me to him. Well, he was in the place at Lanuvium, which he made over to Lepidus:
                    and the first thing he said to me was, "I have just had a letter in which Caesar
                    definitely asserts that he will be here before the Roman games." I read the
                    letter. It dilated on my Cato, and he said that by reading it frequently he had
                    increased his flow of language, and, when he read Brutus' Cato, he began to
                    think himself eloquent. I learned from him that the formal acceptance of
                    Cluvius' legacy was an unconditional acceptance within sixty days before
                    witnesses. How careless of Vestorius not to tell me! I was afraid I should have
                    to send for him: but now I must </p>

                <p> commission him to accept at my orders. So this same Pollex can take the message.
                    I discussed Cluvius' gardens with Balbus too, and he was most obliging. For he
                    said he would write to Caesar at once, but that Cluvius had subtracted from
                    Hordeonius' legacy some .£500<note type="footnote" n="1" place="opposite">1

                    other things, but nothing from my share. Please remonstrate with Vestorius. It
                    is surely most out of place for Plotius the perfumer to send his own special
                    messengers with full particulars to Balbus so long in advance, while Vestorius
                    does not send me news even by my messengers. I am sorry about Cossinius; I was
                    fond of him. I will make over to Quintus anything that may be left after paying
                    my debts and making purchases, for which I am afraid I shall incur more debt.
                    About the house at Arpinum I know nothing. There is no necessity to grumble at
                    Vestorius, for to-night, after I had sealed this letter, my messenger came
                    bringing a letter full of details and a copy of the will. <milestone

                    I had a letter from Lepidus at Antium. That is where he is, for he has the house
                    I sold. He implores me to be in the Senate on the 1st, saying that both he and
                    Caesar would take it as a great favour. I don't think it is of any importance;
                    for Oppius would probably have said something to you, as Balbus is ill. However
                    I would rather come for nothing, if necessary, than have my absence noticed. I
                    should regret it afterwards. So to-day I go to Antium, tomorrow home by midday.
                    I should like you and Pilia to come to dinner on the last of the month, if you
                    are not engaged. I hope you have settled with Publilius. I shall rush back to
                    Tusculum on the 1st; for I prefer all the transactions with them to take place
                    in my absence. I am sending my brother's letter to you: it is not a very kind

                    is heir to one-twelfth of his estate—though I know nothing yet: but Lepta to a
                    third. He is afraid he may not be allowed to take the inheritance. It is absurd
                    of course, but still he is afraid. So, if he sends for me, I shall go at once:
                    if not, not till it is necessary. Send back Pollex, when you can. I am sending

                    send me the orations of M. Varro, and Ollius, at any rate that of Ollius. I have
                    read it, but I want to dip into it again: for there are things in it that I can

                    Cn. Octavius; but for Phamea's sake I agreed.<note type="footnote" n="1"
                        place="opposite">1 Or " I did also wish well to Phamea," as
                        Shuckburgh.</note> For, if you remember, when I was standing for the
                    consulship, he sent a promise of any assistance he could render through you; and
                    I appreciated it as much as if I had used it. He came to me and said the judge
                    had undertaken to hear his case on the very same day that the jury were bound by
                    the Pompeian law to settle that of our friend Sestius. For you know the days of
                    those cases have been fixed by law. I answered that he could not but be aware of
                    my obligations to Sestius. If he would choose any other day, I would not fail
                    him. So then he left me in a temper. I think I told you about it. I did not
                    bother myself about it of course, not thinking that a perfectly unwarrantable
                    fit of anger of a stranger concerned me. However I told Gallus the next time I
                    was in town what I had heard, without mentioning young Balbus. Gallus took the
                    matter up, as he tells me. He says Tigellius asserts that I suspect him because
                    of my bad conscience about my desertion of Phamea. Accordingly I commission you
                    to find out what you can from young Balbus, but not to bother your head about
                    me. It is quite a good thing to have somebody to hate with a will, and not to
                    pander to everybody any more than to be asleep for everybody.<note

                        to Gallus (Ad Fam. vit. 24) Cicero says, Cipius, opinor, olim " non omnibus

                        /> that Cipius used to shut his eyes to his wife's barefaced amours in his
                        presence; but when a servant, thinking him asleep, stole a cup before his
                        eyes, he woke up with this remark.</note> Though upon my word, as you know,

                    of your letters that I should set about composing a longer letter to send to
                    Caesar, and Balbus told me lately at Lanuvium that he and Oppius had written to
                    Caesar telling him I had read his books against Cato and strongly approved of
                    them: so I wrote a letter to Caesar about those books to be sent to Dolabella.
                    But I sent a copy to Oppius and Balbus, asking them to send on my letter to
                    Dolabella, if they themselves approved of the copy. So they have answered that
                    they never read anything better and have had my letter forwarded to Dolabella.
                    Vestorius has written asking me to make over my share in the property of
                    Brinnius to a slave of his on behalf of one Hetereius, so that he can complete
                    the transfer at Puteoli according to law. If you think it right, send the slave
                    to me; for I suppose Vestorius has written to you too. About Caesar's coming
                    Oppius and Balbus tell me the same as you. I am surprised that you have not yet
                    had a talk with Tigellius. For instance, I should much like to know just how
                    much he got; however I don't really care a straw. You ask what I think about
                    going to meet Caesar. Where are you thinking of, unless it is Alsium? Indeed I
                    have written to Murena asking him to take me in; but I suppose he has gone with
                    Matius. So I shall inflict myself on Sallustius. When I had written the last
                    line, Eros told me Murena gave him the kindest of answers: so let me make use of
                    him. For Silius has no cushions, while Dida, I believe, has given up his whole

                    when we met. So I wrote without flattery, and yet I think he will read it with

                    walked on the shore. After two he took his bath. Then he heard about Mamurra

                    haec fors viderit, ea quae talibus in rebus plus quam ratio potest. Nos autem id
                    videamus, quod in nobis ipsis esse debet, ut, quicquid acciderit, fortiter et

                    deliberationem, qua sollicitor. Ita multa veniunt in mentem in utramque partem.
                    Proficiscor, ut constitueram, legatus in Graeciam: caedis inpendentis periculum
                    non nihil vitare videor, sed casurus in aliquam vituperationem, quod rei
                    publicae defuerim tam gravi tempore. Sin autem mansero, fore me quidem video in
                    discrimine, sed accidere posse suspicor, ut prodesse possim rei publicae. Iam
                    illa consilia privata sunt, quod sentio valde esse utile ad confirmationem
                    Ciceronis me illuc venire; nec alia causa profectionis mihi ulla fuit tum, cum
                    consilium cepi legari a Caesare. Tota igitur hac de re, ut soles, si quid ad me
                    pertinere putas, cogitabis. Redeo nunc ad epistulam tuam. Scribis enim esse

                <p> nisi quid, quod magis me delectet, invenero. Quintus autem de emendo nihil curat

                    quicquam iucundius. Sed haec quoque hactenus. Redeo enim ad miseram seu nullam
                    potius rem publicam. M. Antonius ad me scripsit de restitutione Sex. Clodi; quam
                    honorifice, quod ad me attinet, ex ipsius litteris cognosces (misi enim tibi

                    quietam senectutem et honorificam potius agere quam sollicitam. Postremo meo

                    potuisses. Nam, cum te semper amavi, primum tuo studio, post etiam beneficio pro

                    habeam neminem. Litterae vero tuae cum amantissime tum honorificentissime
                    scriptae sic me adfecerunt, ut non dare tibi beneficium viderer, sed accipere a

                    enim umquam non modo acerbum in me fuit, sed ne paulo quidem tristius aut

                    modo non facturum, sed etiam ne passurum quidem fuisse. Sequetur Rufio
                    Vestorianus, Victor numquam scriptus, ceteri, quis non? Cui servire ipsi non
                    potuimus, eius libellis paremus. Nam Liberalibus quis potuit in senatum non

                    Rapinas scribis ad Opis fieri; quas nos quoque tum videbamus. Ne nos et liberati

                    venissem, quamquam erat oppressus totius corporis doloribus, tamen, antequam me
                    plane salutavit, " O mi Cicero," inquit, "gratulor tibi, cum tantum vales apud
                    Dolabellam, quantum si ego apud sororis filium valerem, iam salvi esse possemus.
                    Dolabellae vero tuo et gratulor et gratias ago; quem quidem post te consulem
                    solum possumus vere consulem dicere." Dein multa de facto ac de re gesta tua;
                    nihil magnificentia, nihil praeclarius actum umquam, nihil rei publicae
                    salutaris. Atque haec una vox omnium est. A te autem peto, ut me hanc quasi
                    falsam hereditatem alienae gloriae sinas cernere meque aliqua ex parte in
                    societatem tuarum laudum venire patiare. Quamquam, mi Dolabella, (haec enim
                    iocatus sum) libentius omnes meas, si modo sunt aliquae meae laudes, ad te
                    transfuderim quam aliquam partem exhauserim ex tuis. Nam, cum te semper tantum
                    dilexerim, quantum tu intellegere potuisti, tum his tuis factis sic incensus
                    sum, ut nihil umquam in amore fuerit ardentius. Nihil est enim, mihi crede,
                    virtute formosius, nihil pulchrius, nihil amabilius. Semper amavi, ut scis, M.
                    Brutum propter eius summum ingenium, suavissimos mores, singularem probitatem
                    atque constantiam. </p>

                <p> Tamen Idibus Martiis tantum accessit ad amorem, ut mirarer locum fuisse augendi

                    eum amorem, quem erga te habebam, posse aliquid accedere? Tantum accessit, ut
                    mihi nunc denique amare videar, ante dilexisse. Quare quid est, quod ego te
                    horter, ut dignitati et gloriae servias? Proponam tibi claros viros, quod facere
                    solent, qui hortantur? Neminem habeo clariorem quam te ipsum. Te imitere
                    oportet, tecum ipse certes. Ne licet quidem tibi iam tantis rebus gestis non tui
                    similem esse. Quod cum ita sit, hortatio non est necessaria, gratulatione magis
                    utendum est. Contigit enim tibi, quod haud scio an nemini, ut summa severitas
                    animadversionis non modo non invidiosa, sed etiam popularis esset et cum bonis
                    omnibus tum infimo cuique gratissima. Hoc si tibi fortuna quadam contigisset,
                    gratularer felicitati tuae, sed contigit magnitudine cum animi tum etiam ingenii
                    atque consilii. Legi enim contionem tuam. Nihil illa sapientius. Ita pedetemptim

                    florente Bruto nostro constitutaque re publica. Sed nunc quidem, ut scribis, non
                    utrumvis. Adsentiris enim mihi nostram aetatem a castris, praesertim civilibus,
                    abhorrere. Antonius ad me tantum de Clodio rescripsit, meam lenitatem et
                    clementiam et sibi esse gratam et mihi voluptati magnae fore. Sed Pansa furere
                    videtur de Clodio itemque de Deiotaro, et loquitur severe, si velis credere.
                    Illud tamen non belle, ut mihi quidem videtur, quod factum Dolabellae vehementer
                    improbat. De coronatis, cum sororis tuae filius a patre accusatus esset,
                    rescripsit se coronam habuisse honoris Caesaris causa, posuisse luctus gratia;
                    postremo se libenter vituperationem subire, quod amaret etiam mortuum Caesarem.
                    Ad Dolabellam, quem ad modum tibi dicis placere, scripsi diligenter. Ego etiam
                    ad Siccam; tibi hoc oneris non impono. Nolo te illum iratum habere. Servi

                    gesta et in solutione et in Albiano negotio, grata. De tuo autem Buthroto, cum
                    in Pompeiano essem, Misenum venit Antonius. Inde ante discessit, quam illum
                    venisse audissem in Samnium. A quo 1 vide quid speres. Romae igitur de Buthroto.

                    Ciceroni suppeditas, gratum. Quod errare me putas, qui rem publicam putem

                    TO ATTICUS, GREETING, <note type="margin">At Matins' villa, April 7, B.C.
                        44</note> I have stopped for a visit with the man we were speaking of in the
                        morning.<note type="footnote" n="1">1 C. Matius Calvena.</note> His view is
                    that nothing could be more disgraceful and the thing was quite hopeless. "For if
                    Caesar with his genius could not find a solution, who will find it now? " In a
                    word he said the end had come (which may be true, but he was pleased about it),
                    and assured me that in less than twenty days there would be a rising in Gaul. He
                    has not discussed the matter with anyone except Lepidus since the 15th of March:
                    and, in fine, things cannot pass off like this. What a wise man is Oppius! He
                    regrets Caesar quite as much, but says nothing that can offend any of the loyal
                    party. So much for that. Pray do not delay in sending me any news—and I expect
                    there is plenty: among other things whether we may be sure of Sextus, but
                    especially about our friend Brutus. About him the man I am staying with says
                    Caesar used to say: " What he wants is of great importance, but whatever he
                    wants, he wants it badly "; and that he noticed it, when he pleaded for
                    Deiotarus at Nicaea, for he seemed to speak with emphasis and with boldness, j
                    Again—I like to write </p>

                <pb n="219"/>
                <p> the first thing that comes into my head—recently, when at~Sestius' request I
                    paid Caesar a visit and was sitting waiting to be called in, he remarked: “Can I
                    doubt that I am heartily detested, when Cicero sits waiting and cannot visit me
                    at his convenience? Yet, if ever there was a good-natured man, he" is one.
                    However, I have no doubt that he detests me." That and more to the same effect.
                    But to return to the point. Write me anything there is to write, not only
                    important matters, but even petty details. I shall not let anything escape me.

                        type="margin">From Matius' villa. April 8,B.C. 44</note> I had two letters
                    from you yesterday. From the first I learned about the theatre and

                        of a mime by Publilius Syra.</note> good signs of the unanimous feeling of
                    the people. The applause given to Cassius I thought even overdone, The other
                    letter was about Bald-pate,<note type="footnote" n="2">2 Madaro = μαδαρῷ, "
                        bald-pate," a pun on Calvena, Matins' agnomen. The reading and rendering of
                        the rest of the sentence is doubtful.</note> though he is not so bald as you
                    think. For he has advanced, though not very far. I have been detained too long
                    by his talk. What I mentioned to you, perhaps a little obscurely, was like this.
                    He said Caesar remarked to him, when 1 went to see him at Sestius' request and
                    was sitting waiting: " Can I be foolish enough to think that this man,
                    good-natured though he is, is friendly to me, when he has to sit and wait for my
                    convenience so long." So you have in Bald-pate a bitter enemy of peace, that is
                    to say, of Brutus. </p>

                <pb n="221"/>
                <p> I am thinking of going to Tusculum to-day, to Lanuvium to-morrow, and then to
                    Astura. I am ready to entertain Pilia, though I should like Attica. However, I
                    forgive you. So greet me to them both. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>III

                        44</note> Your letter is full of peace, and I only hope peace may last some
                    time. Matius does not think it can. Here are my builders, who had gone off
                    harvesting, returning empty-handed and bringing a strong report that all the
                    corn is being taken to Antony's house at Rome. Of course it is a false alarm, or
                    I should have heard it from you. Not a sign as yet of Balbus' man Corumbus. I
                    know the name; he is said to be a good architect. It appears to me there was
                    reason in their asking you to be present at the sealing of that will: for they
                    want us to think them friendly, and I don't see why that should not be their
                    real feeling. But what does it matter to us? However, scent out Antony's
                    intentions; I fancy he is more concerned about his banquets than about plotting
                    any harm. If you have any news of practical importance, let me hear it; if not,
                    give me full details as to who were cheered by the people at the mimes, and the
                    epigrams of the actors. My love to Pilia and Attica. <milestone unit="section"

                <p> worries me is what never happened in any other state, that the constitution has
                    not been recovered when freedom has. It is frightful to listen to the rumours
                    and the threats: and I am afraid of a war in Gaul and of what side Sextus will
                    take. But though all the world conspire against us, the Ides of March console
                    me. Our heroes accomplished most gloriously and magnificently all that they
                    could accomplish by themselves; the other matters require money and forces, and
                    we have neither. That is all I have to say to you. If you have any news (for I
                    expect something every day), let me know quickly, and, even if there is no news,
                    don't let us break our custom and not exchange notes. I will see that 1 don't.

                        type="margin">Astura, April 11, B.C. 44</note> I hope you are as well as I
                    wish you to be by now, as you were fasting owing to a slight indisposition: but
                    I should like to know how you are. It is a good sign that Calvena is annoyed at
                    Brutus' suspicions; but it will be by no means a good sign if the legions come
                    from Gaul with their ensigns. What do you think about those that were in Spain?
                    Won't they make the same demands? And what of those that Annius took across? I
                    meant to say C. Asinius, but I had a lapsus memoriae. A fine mess the
                        gambler<note type="footnote" n="1">1 Antony.</note> is making. For that
                    conspiracy of Caesar's freedmen might have been put down easily, if Antony had
                    his wits about him. How foolish were my scruples in refusing a free legation
                    before the vacation for fear of appearing to shirk this turmoil. Of course, if I

                <p> have helped to remedy it, I had no right to fail in my duty. But you see the
                    magistrates, if they can be called magistrates; you see, in spite of all, the
                    tyrant's satellites in authority; you see his army, you see his veterans on our
                    flank. All these can easily be fanned into flame. But those who ought to be
                    hedged about and even honoured by the watchful care of the whole world, are only
                    praised and admired —and confined to their houses. And they, be that as it may,

                    Octavius' arrival, whether there was a rush to meet him and whether there was
                    any suspicion of a coup d'etat. I don't suppose there was, but still I should
                    like to know, whatever happened. I am writing this as I leave Astura on the 11th

                        type="margin">Fundi, April 12, B.C. 44</note> On the 12th I received your
                    letter at Fundi during dinner. First you are better, and secondly you send
                    better news. For the news about the coming of the legions was annoying. That
                    about Octavius is neither here nor there. I am anxious to hear about Marius. I
                    thought Caesar had got rid of him. Antony's conversation with our heroes is not
                    unsatisfactory under the circumstances. However, nothing at present gives me any
                    pleasure except the Ides of March. For now that I am at Fundi with our friend
                    Ligur, I am annoyed at an estate of a Sextilius being in the hands of a knave
                    like Curtilius. In mentioning this instance I am speaking of a whole class. For
                    can there be a more wretched state of affairs than </p>

                <pb n="227"/>
                <p> that we should keep up the things for which we detested him? Are we to have
                    consuls and tribunes, too, for the next two years selected by him? I don't see
                    how I can possibly take part in politics. For nothing could be more topsy-turvy
                    than to belaud the slayers of the tyrant to the skies and to defend the tyrant's
                    acts. But you see the consuls; you see the other magistrates, if they can be
                    called magistrates; you see the indifference of the loyalists. In the country
                    towns they are jumping for joy. I cannot describe their rejoicing, how they
                    flock round me, how they want to hear what I have to say about the state. And in
                    the meantime no senatorial decrees. For our policy is this, that we are afraid
                    of the conquered party. This I have written during dessert. I will write fuller
                    and more about politics later, and do you write what you are doing and what is
                    being done. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>VII CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.
                        <note type="margin">Formiae, April 15, B.C. 44</note> I saw Paulus at Caieta
                    on the 14th. He told me about Marius and gave me very bad news about the State.
                    From you, of course, I have nothing, as none of my men have arrived. But I hear
                    our friend Brutus has been seen near Lanuvium. Where on earth is he going to be?
                    For I want to know among other things everything about him. I am writing this as
                    I leave Formiae on the 15th, and I hope to reach Puteoli on the next day. I have
                    had a letter from my son in quite the best style, and fairly long. Other things
                    may be put on, but the style of the letter shows that he is learning something.
                    Now I appeal to you earnestly to see </p>

                <pb n="229"/>
                <p> that he wants for nothing: I had already mentioned the point to you. It is a
                    point that concerns my duty and my reputation and dignity as well; and I see you
                    take that view yourself. Of course, if I go to Greece, as I should like, in
                    July, everything will be easier: but, as the times are such that I cannot be
                    sure what will be honourable, possible, or expedient for me, I beg you to be
                    careful that we supply him with a reasonable and liberal income. As usual you
                    will consider these points and others that concern me, and will write and tell
                    me the pertinent facts or, if there are none, whatever comes into your head.

                    ATTICUS, GREETING. <note type="margin">Puteoli, April 17, B.C. 44</note> From
                    your letters I have learned much about politics. I had a whole batch of them at
                    the same time from the freedman of Vestorius. However, I will answer your
                    questions shortly. Firstly, I am delighted about the Cluvian property. You ask
                    why I sent for Chrysippus. Two of my shops have fallen down and the rest are
                    cracking: so not only the tenants, but even the mice, have migrated. Other
                    people call it a calamity, but I don't count it even a nuisance. O Socrates and
                    followers of Socrates, I can never thank you sufficiently. Ye gods! how
                    insignificant I count all such things. However, at the advice and on the
                    suggestion of Vestorius I have adopted a plan of rebuilding which will make my
                    loss a profit. There are lots of people here, and I hear there </p>

                <pb n="233"/>
                <p> will be more. Two of them are the so-called consuls designate. Good God, the
                    tyranny lives though the tyrant is dead! We rejoice at his assassination and
                    defend his actions. So see how severely M. Curtius criticizes us! We feel
                    ashamed to live, and he is perfectly right. For to die is a thousand times
                    better than to suffer such things, which seem to me to be likely to continue for
                    some considerable time. Balbus, too, is here, and is often with me. He has had a
                    letter from Vetus, dated the last of December, saying that when Caecilius was
                    besieged and already within his grasp, the Parthian Pacorus came with a large
                    force, and so Caecilius was snatched from his hands and he lost many men. For
                    that he blames Volcacius. So I suppose there is a war imminent there. But that
                    is Dolabella's and Nicias' look out. Balbus also has better news about Gaul.
                    Twenty-one days ago he had a letter that the Germans and the tribes there, on
                    hearing about Caesar, sent ambassadors to Aurelius, who was appointed by
                    Hirtius, saying that they would do as they were bidden. In fact everything seems
                    peaceable there, contrary to what Calvena said. <milestone unit="section" n="10"

                    to return to my point. Shall I not be able to maintain to some extent my case

                    of respect and friendship. His people address him as Caesar, but Philippus does
                    not, and so I do not either. I hold that it is impossible for a loyal citizen to
                    do so. We are surrounded by so many who threaten death to our friends, and

                        type="margin">Puteoli, April 26, B.C. 44</note> The letter you sent on the
                    19th did not reach me for seven days. In it you ask whether I take more pleasure
                    in hills and a view or a walk by the silver sea, and you seem to think I may not
                    know myself. Upon my word, both are so beautiful, as you say, that I doubt which
                    to prefer. "But no thought have we of the service of a dainty meal; nay, seeing
                    a woeful heavy bane sent on us by heaven, we shudder in doubt whether we shall
                    be saved or perish." For although you have sent me great and welcome news about
                    D. Brutus having joined his troops, in which I see great hopes, still, if there
                    is going to be civil war—and that there must be, if Sextus stays under arms, as
                    I know for certain he will—I don't know what we are to do. For now there will be
                    no chance of sitting on the fence, as there was in Caesar's war. For, if this
                    gang of ruffians thinks anyone was rejoiced at the death of Caesar—and we all of
                    us showed our joy quite openly—they will count him an enemy; and that looks like
                    a considerable massacre. Our alternative is to take refuge in Sextus' camp, or
                    join ourselves to Brutus if we can. That is a hateful business and unsuitable
                    for our age, </p>

                <pb n="245"/>
                <p> especially considering the uncertainty of war; and somehow or other it seems to
                    me that I can say to you and you to me: " My son, to thee are not given the arts
                    of war; nay, do thou rather compass the witching arts of speech."<note
                        type="footnote" n="1">1 In the original the last word is γάμοιο not
                        λόγοιο.</note> But that we must leave to chance, which is of more importance
                    in such matters than reason. For ourselves, let us look to the one thing that
                    ought to be in our power, that, whatever may happen, we may bear it with courage
                    and philosophy, remembering that we are but mortal, and console ourselves a good
                    deal with literature and not least with the Ides of March. Now come to my aid in
                    settling a point which is causing me anxiety. So much to be said on both sides
                    occurs to me. If I set off, as I intended, on a free embassy to Greece, it seems
                    as though I might avoid to some extent the danger of a massacre which is
                    threatening, but I shall not escape some blame for deserting the state in such a
                    crisis. On the other hand, if I stay, I see I shall be in danger, but I suspect
                    there is a possibility that I may help the State. There are also private
                    considerations, that I think it would be of great use in settling my son down if
                    I went to Athens; and that was the only reason for my going, when I had the idea
                    of getting the offer of an embassy from Caesar. So consider every side of the
                    case, as you usually do in my affairs. I return now to your letter. You say
                    there are rumours that I am thinking of selling my house on the Lucrine lake and
                    of handing over to Quintus my tiny villa at quite a fancy price, that he may
                    bring the heiress Aquilia to it, as young Quintus says. Ι have had no thought of
                    selling it, unless I </p>

                <pb n="247"/>
                <p> find something that suits me better, while Quintus is not thinking of buying it
                    at the present time. He is quite bothered enough with repaying the dowry,<note
                        type="footnote" n="1">1 To Pomponia, sister of Atticus, whom he had recently
                        divorced.</note> and is expressing the deepest gratitude to Egnatius for his
                    assistance. To marrying again he is so averse that he declares a bachelor's
                    couch is the most comfortable in the world. But enough of this also. For now I
                    return to the crushed or rather nonexistent republic. M. Antonius has written to
                    me about the recall of Sex. Clodius. You will see from the copy I include that
                    the tone of his letter, so far as concerns myself, is complimentary enough. But
                    you can easily imagine the proposal is so unprincipled, so disgraceful, and so
                    mischievous, that at times one almost wishes for Caesar back again. For things
                    that Caesar never would have done, nor allowed to be done, are now being brought
                    forward from forged notes of his. However, I have shown myself quite complaisant
                    to Antonius. For when he has once got it into his head that he may do what he
                    chooses, he would have done it just as readily against my will. So I have sent
                    you a copy of my letter too. <milestone unit="section" n="13a"/>XIIIa ANTONY THE
                    CONSUL SENDS HIS GREETINGS TO M. CICERO. <note type="margin">Rome, April 22 to

                    suddenly, that I did not see you personally about the following request. So I
                    fear I may have less weight with you in my absence. But if your goodness of
                    heart answers to the opinion I have always had of you, I shall be very glad. </p>

                <pb n="249"/>
                <p> I petitioned Caesar for the return of Sex. Clodius, and obtained my request. It
                    was my intention even then only to use his favour if you allowed. So I am now
                    the more anxious that you may let me do it with your permission. But, if you
                    show yourself hard-hearted to his affliction and misery, I will not contend with
                    you, though I think I ought to observe Caesar's memoranda. But upon my word, if
                    you are ready to take a generous, philosophical, and amiable view of my actions,
                    you will, I am sure, show your indulgence, and will wish that most promising
                    youth, P. Clodius, to think that you did not act spitefully to his father's
                    friends when you had the chance. I beseech you to let it seem that your feud
                    with his father was on public grounds, not because you despised the family. For
                    we can lay aside quarrels we took up on public grounds with more honour and more
                    readiness than those that come from a personal insult. So give me a chance of
                    inculcating this lesson, and while the boy's mind is still receptive, let us
                    convince him that quarrels should not be handed down from generation to
                    generation. Though I know your fortune, Cicero, is above any danger, yet I think
                    you would rather enjoy old age with peace and honour than with anxiety. Finally
                    I feel a right to ask you this favour, for I have done all I could for your
                    sake. If I do not gain it, I shall not grant Clodius his restoration, so that
                    you may understand how much your authority weighs in my eyes, and that may make
                    you all the more placable. </p>

                        <note type="margin">puteoli April 26 B.C. 44</note> There is one reason why
                    I wish you had made personally the request you are making by letter. Then you
                    could have seen my affection for you not only from what I said, but from my
                    "expression, eyes and brow," as the phrase goes. For I have always had an
                    affection for you, urged thereto at first by your attention to me and afterwards
                    by benefits received, and in these days public affairs have so recommended you
                    to me that there is no one for whom I have more regard. The letter you have
                    written to me in such a friendly and flattering tone makes me feel as though I
                    were receiving a favour from you, not granting one to you, since you refuse to
                    recall your friend, who was my enemy, against my will, though you could quite
                    easily do so. Of course I grant your request, my dear Antony, and I think
                    myself, too, most liberally and honourably treated, when you address me in such
                    a strain. I should have thought it right to grant it you freely, whatever the
                    facts had been, and besides, I am gratifying my own natural kindliness. For I
                    never had any bitterness or even the slightest sternness or severity in me,
                    except what was demanded by public necessity. Besides, I never had any special
                    grudge against Clodius himself, and I always laid down the rule that one should
                    not attack one's enemies' friends, especially their humbler friends, nor should
                    we ourselves be deprived of such supporters. As regards the boy Clodius I think
                    it is your duty to imbue his "receptive mind," as you say, with the idea that </p>

                <pb n="253"/>
                <p> there is no enmity between our families. I fought P. Clodius because I was
                    fighting for the State, he for his own hand; and the State decided the merits of
                    our controversy. If he were alive now I should have no further quarrel with him.
                    So, since in making your request you say you will not use the power you have
                    against my will, you may make this concession to the boy too in my name, if you
                    will; not that a man of my age has anything to fear from a youth of his, or that
                    a person of my position needs shrink from any quarrel, but that we may be more
                    intimate than we have been as yet. For these feuds have come between us, and so
                    your heart has been more open to me than your house. But enough of this. I have
                    one thing to add, that, whatever I think you wish, and whatever is to your
                    interest, I shall never have any hesitation in carrying out with all my heart
                    and soul. Of that I hope you will feel fully persuaded. <milestone

                    Let us consider the more political part. You defend Brutus and Cassius, as
                    though you thought I blamed them, though I cannot find praise enough for them.
                    It is the weak points of the situation, not of the persons that I put together.
                    For though the tyrant is dead, I see the tyranny persists. For things that he
                    would not have done are being done now, as, for example, the recalling of
                    Clodius —a thing I am sure he had no intention of doing and would not even have
                    allowed to be done. Vestorius' enemy Rufio will follow, and Victor, whose name
                    was never in Caesar's notes, and the rest; every one in fact. We could not be
                    Caesar's slaves, but we bow down to his note-books. For who dared absent himself
                    from the Senate on the Liberalia?<note type="footnote" n="2">2 March 17. Cf.
                        Att. XIV. 10.</note> Suppose it had been possible somehow: even when we did
                    come, could we speak our mind freely? Had we not to take precious good care of
                    the veterans, who were there under arms, since we had no support ourselves. You
                    can bear witness that that sitting -till on the Capitol was not approved by me.
                    Well, was that the fault of Brutus and the rest? Not a bit of it: it was the
                    fault of the other brute beasts, who think themselves cautious and canny. They
                    thought it enough to rejoice, some of them to go so far as to congratulate, none
                    to stand their ground. But let us put the past behind us: let us guard our
                    heroes with all our care and protection: and, as you say, let us be content with
                    the Ides of March. That day gave our friends, who are more than men, an entrance
                    to heaven, but it did not give freedom to </p>

                <p> the Roman people. Recall your words. Don't you remember how you exclaimed that
                    all was lost if Caesar had a public funeral? And very wise it was. So you see
                    what has come of the funeral. You say Antony is going to bring a proposal before
                    the Senate on the 1st of June about the allotment of provinces, that he should
                    have Gaul and that both his own and his colleague's tenure should be prolonged.
                    Will the House be allowed to vote freely? If so, I shall rejoice that liberty
                    has been regained; if not, what has this change of masters brought me except the
                    joy of feasting my eyes on the just death of a tyrant? You say there is
                    plundering at the Temple of Ops: I saw it then with my own eyes. Yea, we have
                    been set free by heroes and are not free after all. So theirs is the praise and
                    ours the blame. And you advise me to write history, to collect all the crimes of
                    those who even now have us under their thumb. Shall I be able to resist praising

                    this feigning of regret, which up to now was creeping on day by day, and, if it
                    became a habit, I was afraid it might be dangerous to our tyrannicides. Now I
                    quite agree with your letter and hope for better things. However I cannot put up
                    with the people who under a pretence of wishing for peace defend criminal
                    actions. But still we can't have everything at once. Things are beginning to get
                    better than I had expected, and of course I will not go away, unless you think I
                    can do so honourably. My friend Brutus certainly I will never desert; and I
                    should act in the same way, even if there were no ties between us, on account of
                    his extraordinary and incredible strength of character. </p>

                    the villa at the Lucrine lake to Pilia with its servants and care-takers. Myself
                    I am threatening our friend Paetus' cheese and herrings •or that day; in a few
                    days I am going to Pompeii and after that sailing back to my domains here at
                    Puteoli and Cumae. What very attractive places they are, if it were not that one
                    almost has to shun them on account of the crowd of visitors. But to return to
                    the point, what a magnificent stroke of our friend Dolabella! How it will make
                    people open their eyes. For my part I keep on praising and encouraging him. You
                    are right in what you say in every letter about the deed and about the man. To
                    me it seems that our friend Brutus could walk through the forum with a golden
                    crown on his head now. For who would dare to hurt him with the cross and rock
                    before his eyes, especially when the rabble have shown such applause and
                    approbation? Now, my dear Atticus, do put things straight for me. I want to run
                    over to Greece, as soon as I have quite satisfied Brutus. It is a matter of
                    great concern to my son, or rather to me, or upon my word to both of us, that I
                    should drop in upon </p>

                <pb n="263"/>
                <p> him at his studies. For what is there to give us any particular satisfaction in
                    the letter of Leonidas, which you have sent to me? I shall never be content with
                    his praise, when it is phrased, " as things go at present." There is no evidence
                    of confidence, rather of anxiety in that. Again I had commissioned Herodes to
                    write to me in detail: but as yet I have not had a single syllable from him. I
                    am afraid he has had no news that he thought would gratify me, if I heard it. I
                    am very grateful to you for writing to Xeno; for that my son should not be short
                    of money concerns both my duty and my reputation. I hear that Flaminius Flamma
                    is in Rome. I have written to tell him that I have instructed you by letter to
                    speak to him about Montanus' business: and, I should be glad if you would see
                    that the letter I have sent for him is delivered, and would speak with him at
                    your leisure. I think, if the man has any sense of shame, he will see that the
                    payment is not deferred to my loss. You were very kind in informing me of
                    Attica's recovery before I knew of her illness. <milestone unit="section" n="17"

                        44</note> I reached Pompeii on the 3rd of May, having established Pilia in
                    my place at Cumae the day before, as I told you in a former letter. While I was
                    at dinner there, the letter you had given to the freedman Demetrius on the last
                    of April was delivered. There was a lot of wise advice in it, but, as you admit
                    yourself, with the reservation </p>

                <pb n="265"/>
                <p> that everything seems to depend on chance. So these points we will discuss on
                    the spot when we meet. As regards the business about Buthrotum I only wish I
                    could meet Antony. I am sure [ could make good headway with him. But people
                    think he won't stir from Capua, and I fear his going there will do a great deal
                    of harm to the state. L. Caesar, whom I saw yesterday very ill at Naples,
                    thought the same too. So I shall have to handle this subject and get it settled
                    on the 1st of June. But enough of this. Young Quintus has sent his father a most
                    unpleasant letter, which was delivered when we reached Pompeii. The chief point
                    of it was that he would not put up with Aquilia as a step-mother: but that
                    perhaps is excusable. But to say he owed everything to Caesar, nothing to his
                    father, and for the future he looked to Antonius—what a scoundrel! However that
                    shall be attended to. I have written to Brutus, to Cassius and to Dolabella. I
                    send you copies; not that I am in doubt whether to send the letters or not; for
                    I feel sure that they ought to be sent, and I have no doubt you will agree with
                    me. Please, dear Atticus, supply my boy with as much money as you think fit, and
                    forgive me for troubling you. For what you have done already I am most grateful.
                    That unpublished book of mine<note type="footnote" n="1">1 Possibly his poem De

                    against that disreputable party with less danger in the tyrant's </p>

                    whichever way we turn, we are reminded not only of Caesar's enactments, but also
                    of his intentions. Please see about Montanus, since Flamma has arrived. I think
                    the matter ought to be put on a better footing. <milestone unit="section"

                        type="margin">Pompeii, May 3, B.C 44</note> Though I feel content with the
                    glory you have won, my dear Dolabella, and it affords me the greatest joy and
                    pleasure, still I cannot help confessing that the crowning point of my joy is,
                    that in the popular opinion my name is associated with yours in people's praise.
                    I am daily meeting many people; for quite a number of persons of consideration
                    come here for their health, besides many acquaintances of mine from the country
                    towns; and I have not met anyone who does not extol you to the skies, and in the
                    same breath offer me the sincerest congratulations. For they say they have no
                    doubt that it is by following my precepts and advice that you are snowing
                    yourself a most distinguished citizen and an excellent consul. Though I can
                    answer them with the fullest truth that what you do, you do acting on your own
                    judgment and on your own initiative and that you need no advice, still I do not
                    entirely assent, lest I should diminish your glory, if it all appears to have
                    sprung from my advice, nor do I quite deny it; for I have more than my proper
                    share of desire for glory. And yet it would not detract from your </p>

                <pb n="269"/>
                <p> dignity any more than it disgraced Agamemnon, the king of kings, to have some
                    Nestor to assist in your plans; while it would redound to my glory that you with
                    your brilliant reputation as a consul while still so young should be thought a
                    pupil of my training. Indeed L. Caesar, when 1 paid him a visit on his sick bed
                    at Naples, though he was racked with pains all over his body, had hardly
                    finished his first greeting before he said: " My dear Cicero, I congratulate you
                    on the influence you have with Dolabella. If I had had as much with my sister's
                        son,<note type="footnote" n="1">1 Julia, sister of L. Caesar, was mother of
                        Antony by her first husband, Antonius Creticus.</note> we might have been
                    safe now. Dolabella himself I both congratulate and thank: indeed he is the
                    first consul since yourself who can really be called a consul." Then he had much
                    to say about the incident and your achievement. No more splendid and magnificent
                    deed was ever done, nor any more salutary to the state: and that is what the
                    whole world is saying with one voice. I beg you to let me enter into this false
                    heritage of another's glory, and suffer me to share your praises in some slight
                    degree. However, my dear Dolabella, so far I have only been joking, and, if I
                    have any reputation myself, I would rather turn its full stream upon you, than
                    divert any part of yours upon myself. For, though I have always been as fond of
                    you as you must have realized, now by your actions my fondness has been fanned
                    into the most ardent love that is possible. For, believe me, there is nothing
                    fairer than virtue, nothing more beautiful, nothing more loveable. I have always
                    loved M. Brutus, as you know, for his great ability, his most agreeable manners,
                    his extraordinary upright- </p>

                <pb n="271"/>
                <p> ness and constancy. However on the Ides of March my affection was so enhanced
                    that I wondered there was any room for increase in what I had long thought had
                    reached its culminating point. Who would have thought that there could be any
                    increase in the affection I have for you? But there has been such an increase
                    that I seem to myself now to love, while before I only liked. So what need is
                    there that I should exhort you to have a regard for your dignity and glory?
                    Shall I do what people generally do when exhorting others, set before your eyes
                    distinguished examples? There is none more distinguished than your own. You must
                    imitate yourself and vie with yourself. Indeed, after such an achievement, you
                    dare not fail to be like yourself. As that is so, exhortation is unnecessary and
                    congratulation is more in place. For you have had the fortune, which I doubt if
                    anyone else ever had, that great severity in punishment should not only bring no
                    ill will, but should be popular and most pleasing to all, both of the upper and
                    of the lower class. If this had happened to you by a stroke of fortune, I should
                    congratulate you on your luck: but it has happened through your greatness of
                    heart, yes, and of ability and of prudence. For I have read your harangue.
                    Nothing could have been more skilful. You led up to the case so gradually and
                    gently, and then left it again, that by universal consent the facts themselves
                    showed it was high time to resort to punitive measures. So you freed the city
                    from danger and the state from fear, and you performed a sound service not only
                    to meet the emergency but to serve as a precedent. After that you ought to
                    understand that the republic is in your hand, and </p>

                <pb n="273"/>
                <p> that you should not only protect but honour the men who paved the way for
                    freedom. But I hope we shall soon meet to discuss these things. Do you, my dear
                    Dolabella, take the greatest care of yourself, since you preserve the state and
                    all of us. <milestone unit="section" n="18"/>XVIII CICERO TO ATTICUS. <note

                    strongly approve of his action, still it was one and then another letter of
                    yours which induced me to belaud it so highly. But Dolabella has entirely lost
                    your good graces for the same reason that he has made me too a bitter enemy.
                    What a shameless fellow! He has not paid yet, though he ought to have done so on
                    the first of January, especially as he has freed himself from enormous debts by
                    the handwriting of Faberius and has sought help from the goddess of help.<note

                    have my joke, that you may not think I am seriously concerned. I had written too
                    to him very early on the 8th, and on the same day in the evening I got a letter
                    from you at Pompeii, delivered very quickly on the third day after you wrote it.
                    But, as I told you then, my letter to Dolabella was sufficiently stinging. If it
                    takes no effect, 1 don't think he will be able to face me. I think you have
                    settled Albius' business. With </p>

                <p> regard to Patulcius' debt, it was most kind of you and just like yourself to
                    come to my aid. But I seem to have deserted Eros, who is just the man to clear
                    the matter up: it was through a grave fault of his that it went wrong. But I
                    will see to that with him. Montanus' business, as I have often said, you must
                    take charge of entirely. I am not surprised that Servius spoke to you in a tone
                    of despair, when he was leaving; and my despair quite equals his. What our
                    friend Brutus is going to do in the Forum, incomparable hero though he is, if he
                    is not going to attend the Senate on the first of June, I do not know. But he
                    should know this better himself. From the things I see in course of preparation
                    I don't think the Ides of March are going to help much. So I am daily thinking
                    more and more of Greece. For I fail to see what use I can be to Brutus, who, as
                    he writes to me, is meditating exile. Leonidas' letter did not give me much
                    pleasure. I agree about Herodes. I should like to have read Saufeius' note. I am
                    thinking of leaving Pompeii on the tenth of May. <milestone unit="section"

                    you wrote), lo and behold your letter and Brutus'. Brutus is meditating exile. I
                    however see another haven and a readier one for my age: but I would rather sail
                    into it with Brutus in prosperity and the republic set in order. But now, as you
                    say, I have not the choice. For you agree that age unfits me for a soldier's
                    camp, especially in civil war. Antony only answered about Clodius, that my
                    leniency and clemency had been very gratifying to him and would be a source of
                    pleasure to myself. But Pansa appears to be in a fury about Clodius and about
                    Deiotarus too; and, if you are willing to believe him, he expresses himself very
                    forcibly. But there is one thing that to my mind is shady, that he strongly
                    disapproves of Dolabella's action. As for the people who wore garlands, when
                    your nephew was reproved for it by his father, he answered that he wore a
                    garland for Caesar's honour, and laid it aside for grief; and finally that he
                    would willingly submit to reproaches for loving Caesar even after his death. To
                    Dolabella I have written carefully, as you advise: and I have written myself to
                    Sicca too. 1 do not want to lay this burden on you, for I don't want him to be
                    angry with you. I recognise Servius' way of talking; and there seems to me to be
                    more fright than wisdom in it. But, since we are all frightened, I agree with
                    Servius. Publilius has been hoaxing. For Caerellia was sent here by them as
                    their ambassadress to me;<note type="footnote" n="2">2 To persuade Cicero to

                <p> I persuaded her easily that what she asked was not even lawful, besides being
                    repugnant to me. If I see Antony, I will do my best for Buthrotum. I come to
                    your more recent letter, though I have answered already about Servius. You say I
                    make much of Dolabella's score. Well, I don't see that he could have made a
                    greater one considering the times and circumstances. However, all the credit I
                    give him I give in accordance with your letter. But I agree with you that it
                    would be still better, if he would pay off my score.<note type="footnote" n="1"

                    by sea to enjoy our friend Lucullus' hospitality on the 10th about nine o'clock
                    in the morning. As I disembarked, I received your letter, which your messenger
                    says was taken to Cumae, dated the 7th. 1 left Lucullus and reached Puteoli
                    about the same hour the next day. There I received two letters, dated one the
                    7th the other </p>

                <pb n="281"/>
                <p> the 9th, from Lanuvium. So listen to my answer to them all. First, my thanks for
                    what you have done in my affairs both in payment and in the business with
                    Albius. Then with regard to your Bnthrotum, when I was at Pompeii, Antony came
                    to Misenum: but he was gone again to Samnium, before I heard he had come. See
                    that you do not build much hope on him. So I must see to Buthrotum at Rome. L.
                    Antonius' speech is horrible, Dolabella's splendid. Let him keep his money now,
                    provided he pays on the Ides. I am sorry about Tertulla's<note type="footnote"

                    a crop of Cassii as much as one of Bruti. I hope it is true about Cleopatra and
                    about Caesar's son<note type="footnote" n="2">2 A child of Cleopatra, called
                        Caesarion. Caesar denied the parentage.</note> too. I have finished your
                    first letter, now I come to your second. The Quinti and Buthrotum we will leave
                    till I come to Rome, as you say. Thanks for supplying my son's needs. You think
                    I am wrong in thinking the republic hangs on Brutus: but it is a fact. There
                    will be none, or he and his party will save it. You exhort me to send a written
                    speech. You may take it from me, my dear Atticus, as a general axiom with regard
                    to those matters, in which I have sufficient experience, that no one, whether
                    poet or orator, ever thought anyone better than himself. This is so even in the
                    case of bad ones: and what do you think it will be in the case of Brutus, who
                    has talent and learning? Besides I have had experience of him lately over the
                    edict. I had written one at your request. I liked mine, he liked his. Nay more,
                    when I was induced by his entreaties to dedicate to him my book </p>

                <pb n="283"/>
                <p> "on the best oratorical style," he wrote not only to me but to you also, that
                    what I found pleasing, he did not approve. So, pray, let every man do his
                    writing for himself. "To each his own wife; mine for me. To each his own love;
                    mine for me." It is not neatly put, for it is by Atilius, the most wooden of
                    poets. I only hope Brutus may be able to deliver a speech. If he can enter the
                    city in safety, we have won. For, as the leader in a new civil war, no one will
                    follow him, or at least only those who can easily be conquered. I come to your
                    third letter. I am glad Brutus and Cassius were pleased with my letter: so I
                    have sent an answer. They want me to turn Hirtius into a better citizen. I am
                    doing my best, and his promises are fair enough, but he spends all his days and
                    nights with Balbus, whose promises are fair enough too. How much of them you can
                    believe, you must see for yourself. I observe you are very well satisfied with
                    Dolabella, and I am more than satisfied. I saw a lot of Pansa at Pompeii: and he
                    quite convinced me that he was well inclined and desirous of peace. I can see
                    quite clearly that a pretext for war is being sought. The edict of Brutus and
                    Cassius I approve. You want me to consider what I think they ought to do. One
                    has to form one's plans according to circumstances; and, as you see, they are
                    changing every hour. I think Dolabella's first move and this speech of his
                    against Antony have both done a lot of good. Things are certainly advancing: and
                    now we seem to be going to have a leader, which is the very thing the country
                    towns and the well affected want. You mention Epicurus and dare to say " take no
                    part in politics." Are you not </p>

                <pb n="285"/>
                <p> frightened out of such talk by our friend Brutus' frown? Young Quintus, you tell
                    me, is Antony's right hand man. So we shall easily get what we want through him.
                    I am wondering what sort of speech Octavius made, if, as you thought, L.
                    Antonius introduced him to a public meeting. I am writing in haste: for Cassius'
                    letter carrier is starting at once. I am going directly to call on Pilia, and
                    then on to dinner with Vestorius by boat. My best love to Attica. <milestone

                        May 11, B.C. 44</note> Just after I had given Cassius' messenger a letter
                    for you on the 11th, came my messenger, and, to my extraordinary surprise,
                    without a letter from you. But I quickly conjectured you had been at Lanuvium.
                    Eros however had hastened to let me have a letter from Dolabella, not about my
                    debt (for he had not got my letter yet), but an answer, and a very good answer
                    too, to the one of which I sent you a copy. No sooner had I got rid of Cassius'
                    messenger than Balbus came to see me. Good God, how easy it is to see that he is
                    afraid of peace! And you know how secretive the man is. Yet he told me Antony's
                    plans. He is canvassing all the veterans, asking them to support Caesar's acts
                    and to take an oath to that effect, to keep in camps, which are to be inspected
                    every month by two officials. He grumbled too about the prejudice against
                    himself, and everything he said seemed to show affection for Antony. In fact
                    there is no reliability in him. To me </p>

                <pb n="287"/>
                <p> there seems no doubt that things are tending towards war. For the deed was done
                    with the courage of men, but with the blind policy of a child. For who did not
                    see that the tyrant left an heir? And what could be more absurd than " to fear
                    the one, and reck not of his friend "? Nay even now there are many absurdities.
                    Think of the mother of the tyrannicide<note type="footnote" n="1"

                    for old age is beginning to make me ill-tempered. Everything puts me in a rage.
                    However, my life is over: the young people must look out for themselves. Take
                    care of my affairs for me, as you are doing. This I have written or rather
                    dictated when at dessert with Vestorius. To-morrow I am thinking of paying a
                    visit to Hirtius, the only survivor of the band of five.<note type="footnote"

                    seven-league boots. Anything is better than a camp. Please pay my best respects
                    to Attica. I am looking for Octavius' speech and any other news there may be,

                        >Puteoli, May 14, B.C 44</note> As soon as I learned from Pilia that she was
                    sending a messenger to you on the 15th, I scrawled this bit of a note. First
                    then I want you to know that I am leaving here for Arpinum on May 17th. So, if
                    you have anything to send after that, you must send it there: though I shall be
                    in Rome almost directly. For I want to scent out as clearly as possible what is
                    going to happen before I come to town. However, I fear my suspicions are not far
                    from the truth. For it is clear enough what they are doing. My pupil,<note
                        type="footnote" n="1">1 Ηirtius.</note> who dined with me to-day, is a warm
                    admirer of the man who was wounded by our Brutus: and, if you want to know, I
                    see quite clearly that they are afraid of peace. This is the theme on which they
                    are always dwelling: that a most distinguished person has been killed, that by
                    his death the whole state has been thrown into disorder; that his acts will be
                    null and void as soon as we have ceased to fear; that his clemency was his
                    destruction, and that, if he had not practised clemency, such a thing could not
                    have happened to him. I cannot help thinking, then, that if Pompey comes with a
                    strong force, which is quite possible, there will certainly be war. When I
                    picture this and think of it, I am disturbed: for now we shall not have the
                    choice you had before. For we have shown our joy openly. Again they speak of us
                    as ingrates. What you and many others did then certainly will not be possible
                    now. Must I put in an appearance, </p>

                <pb n="291"/>
                <p> then, and join the army? A thousand times better to die, especially at my time
                    of life. So now I am not so much consoled as I was with the thought of the Ides
                    of March, for there was a grave mistake committed then. However, those youths
                    "in other noble deeds wipe out their shame."<note type="footnote" n="1">1
                        Attributed to Sophocles.</note> But, if you have any better hope, as you
                    hear more news and are in the midst of affairs, please write, and at the same
                    time consider what I ought to do about the votive legation. Here many people
                    warn me against attending the Senate on the 1st. They say troops are being
                    collected secretly for that occasion, and that too against your friends, who to

                    nihil possit ultra. Ego tamen, si illam causam habuissent, scripsissem

                    esse praesidium. Quam orationem cum ingressus essem, Cassius intervenit. Ego
                    eadem illa repetivi. Hoc loco fortibus sane oculis Cassius (Martem spirare
                    diceres) se in Siciliam non iturum. "Egone ut beneficium accepissem contumeliam?

                    "Brute?" " Romam," inquit, "si tibi videtur." "Mihi vero minime; tuto enim non
                    eris." "Quid? si possem esse, placeretne? " " Atque ut omnino neque nunc neque
                    ex praetura in provinciam ires; sed auctor non sum, ut te urbi committas."
                    Dicebam ea, quae tibi profecto in mentem veniunt, cur non esset tuto futurus.
                    Multo inde sermone querebantur, atque id quidem Cassius maxime, amissas
                    occasiones Decimumque graviter accusabant. Ego negabam oportere praeterita,
                    adsentiebar tamen. Cumque ingressus essem dicere, quid oportuisset, nec vero

                    neminem umquam audivi! " Ego repressi. Sed et Cassius mihi videbatur iturus

                    consulto tolleretur), et noster cito deiectus est de illo inani sermone quo
                    Romae 1 velle esse dixerat. Constituit igitur, ut ludi absente se fierent suo
                    nomine. Proficisci autem mihi in Asiam videbatur ab Antio velle. Ne multa, nihil
                    me in illo itinere praeter conscientiam meam delectavit. Non enim fuit
                    committendum, ut ille ex Italia, priusquam a me conventus esset, discederet. Hoc
                    dempto munere amoris atque officii sequebatur, ut mecum ipse: "Ἡ δεῦρ᾿ ὁδός σοι

                    frumentariam rem aspernabatur; eam Servilia sublaturam ex senatus consulto se
                    esse dicebat. Noster vero καὶ μάλα σεμνῶς in Asiam, posteaquam mihi est adsensus

                    Navigia colligebat; erat animus in cursu. Interea in isdem locis erant futuri.
                    Brutus quidem se aiebat Asturae. L. quidem Antonius liberaliter litteris sine

                    nihil vidi apertius. Fugiamus igitur, et ut ais. Coram Theophanes quid velit,

                    me locutum secum esse Q. Ciceronem valde adseveranter se haec ferre non posse;
                    certum sibi esse ad Brutum et Cassium transire. Hoc enim vero nunc discere aveo:

                    ATTICUS, GREETING. <note type="margin">Puteoli, May 17, B.C. 44</note> What a
                    misfortune about Alexio! It has upset me more than you can believe, and not, I
                    assure you, particularly on the score which most people seem to think it has,
                    asking to what doctor I shall turn now. What do I want with a doctor now? And,
                    if I do want one, is there such a dearth of them? It is his love for me, his
                    kindness and charming manner that I miss. There is another thing, too. What have
                    we not to fear, when so temperate a person and so skilful a physician can be
                    overcome suddenly by such a disease? But for all these things there is one
                    consolation: we are born under this condition, that we may not refuse anything
                    that fate has in store for mortals. As for Antony, I have told you before that I
                    have not met him. For he came to Misenum when I was at Pompeii, and he left
                    before I knew he was there. But by chance, when I was reading your letter,
                    Hirtius was with me at Puteoli. I read it to him and pleaded with him. At first
                    he would not make any concession worth counting, but in the end he said I should
                    direct not only this matter but all his consulship. With Antony I shall put the
                    matter so that he may see that, if he obliges me in this par- </p>


                <pb n="295"/>
                <p> ticular matter, I shall be entirely his for the future. I hope Dolabella is at
                    home. Let us return to our heroes. You hint that you have good hopes for them in
                    the moderate tone of the edicts. But, when Hirtius left me at Puteoli on the
                    16th of May to meet Pansa at Naples, his whole mind was revealed to me. For I
                    took him aside and exhorted him to keep the peace. He could not, of course, say
                    that he did not want peace, but he did say that he was as much afraid of armed
                    action on our side as from Antony, and that after all both had reason for being
                    on their guard, and for his part he was afraid of hostilities from both. In fact
                    he is quite unreliable. About young Quintus I agree with you. His father, at any
                    rate, was most pleased with your nice letter. Caerellia I easily satisfied; she
                    did not seem to me to bother herself much, and, if she had, I certainly should
                    not have done so. As to the lady who you say is plaguing you, I wonder you
                    listened to her at all. For, if I did compliment her before friends, when three
                    of her own sons and your daughter were present, what is there in that? " Why
                    should I wear a mask before men's eves?" Is not old age itself a mask ugly
                    enough? You say Brutus asks me to come before the 1st. He has written to me too,
                    and perhaps I shall do so. But I really don't know what he wants. What advice
                    can I give him, when I want advice myself, and when he has thought of his
                    immortality rather than our peace of mind? The rumour about Cleopatra is dying
                    out. As to Flamma, pray do what you can. </p>

                        type="margin">Sinuessa, May 18, B.C 44</note> Yesterday I sent off a letter
                    to you as 1 was leaving Puteoli and stopped at my house at Cumae. There. 1 found
                    Pilia enjoying the best of health. Indeed, I saw her again shortly afterwards at
                    Cumae. For she had come for a funeral, which I also was attending. Our friend
                    Cn. Lucullus was burying his mother. So I stayed that day at Sinuessa, and there
                    I have scribbled this as I am starting early in the morning of the next day for
                    Arpinum. However, I have no news either to write to you or to ask from you,
                    unless you think this is to the point. Brutus has sent me the speech he
                    delivered in the meeting on the Capitol, and has asked me to correct it without
                    regarding his feelings, before he publishes it. Now the speech is most elegantly
                    expressed as regards its sentiments, and its language could not be surpassed.
                    But myself, if I had pleaded that cause, I should have written with more fire.
                    You realize what the theme is and what the speaker is. So I could not alter it.
                    For considering the style our friend Brutus affects and the opinion he holds of
                    the best style of oratory, he has attained it in its highest elegance in this
                    speech. But rightly or wrongly I have aimed at something different. However, 1
                    should like you to read the speech, if you have not done so already, and to let
                    me know your opinion, though I am afraid that your name will lead you astray and

                    . Then at Vescia your messenger delivered your letter, which contained more than
                    enough about Buthrotum. For you cannot and will not have that business at heart
                    more than I have and shall have: that is the way that I ought to care for your
                    business, and you for mine. Accordingly, as I have undertaken it, I shall give
                    it the preference to everything else. I hear from your letters and others that
                    L. Antonius' speech was a poor thing; but what it was like I do not know, as you
                    have not told me. I am glad to hear about Menedemus. Quintus certainly keeps on
                    reiterating what you mention. I am relieved to hear that you approve of my
                    determination not to write the sort of thing you asked me to write, and you will
                    approve of it much more, if you read the speech about which I am writing to you
                    to-day. What you say about the legions is true. But you do not seem to me to
                    have taken the point sufficiently to heart, if you hope we can settle the matter
                    of Buthrotum through the Senate. In my opinion (for so much I can see) we have
                    no chance of winning; but supposing I am mistaken about that, you will not be
                    disappointed about Buthrotum. About Octavius' speech I think the same as you,

                    want about Alexio. Hirtius is devoted to you. With Antonius I wish things were
                    going even worse than they are. About young Quintus, as you say, assez. About

                    Brutus, when he has published his own. How could that be proper? Should I write
                    as though against a tyrant justly executed? I shall have much to say and much to
                    write, but in another way and at another time. Well done the tribunes about

                    Rut to me his whole policy seems to point to war, since D. Brutus is being
                    robbed of his province. Whatever I may think of Brutus' resources, I don't think
                    that can happen without war. But I don't want war, since the Buthrotians are all
                    right as it is. You may smile: but I am sorry it was not rather accomplished by
                    my persistence, diligence, and influence. You say you don't know what our
                    friends are to do: that difficulty has been bothering me for a long time. So now

                    was that of men, believe me we had no more sense than children. We have only cut

                    engraved on my heart of hearts, if only, as you say, there is an opening for
                    action. You are very insistent about Brutus' speech, since you say so much about

                    and Cassius, not to enter upon any hot-headed scheme, as easily as you can from
                    me. For you say they wrote what you mention when on the point of leaving the

                    everything go to rack and ruin. For upon my honour things are already being
                    upset by rapine, fire, and slaughter. If they have any fear, let them take some
                    precaution merely, and not make any fresh move. Upon my honour they will not
                    accomplish any more by violent measures than they will by quiet, provided they
                    are careful. The present unsettled state of affairs cannot last long in the

                    There is Hirtius' letter. I answered, affirming that they had no hot-headed
                    scheme. 1 wanted you to know this for what it is worth. Just as I had sealed
                    this Balbus writes to me that Servilia has returned, and avers that they will

                    Balbus, with no news in them, and one from Hirtius, who says he is very annoyed
                    with the veterans. My mind is still anxious about what I shall do about the 1st.
                    So I have sent Tiro and some men with him—please give them letters one by one,
                    as things happen—and I have written to Antony about the legation, for fear that,
                    if I had written only to Dolabella, his quick temper might be aroused. But, as
                    it is said to be rather difficult to get an audience with him, I have written to
                    Eutrapelus, so that he may deliver my letter. I must have an embassy: a votive
                    embassy is more honourable, but I could use either. Your own position, I beg
                    you, review most carefully. I wish we could do so together; if not, we must
                    accomplish it by letters. Graeceius has written to me that he has heard from
                    Cassius that armed men are being got ready to be sent to my house at Tusculum. I
                    don't think that is the case; but still I must take care to have more safeguards
                    ready. But to-morrow may give us some food for reflection. </p>

                    present too. I had made up my mind on the journey, and advised him to accept the
                    control of the corn supply from Asia: there was nothing else for us to do now
                    except to keep him out of danger: by so doing we should have some safeguard for
                    the republic too. When I was in the midst of my speech, in came Cassius. I said
                    the same over again. Whereupon Cassius, with flashing eyes and fairly breathing
                    war, declared he would not go to Sicily. "Am I to take an insult like a favour?"
                    "What will you do then? " I asked; and he said he would go to Achaia. " What of
                    you, Brutus?" I said. "To Rome," he answered, "if you think I ought." " I don't
                    think so at all, for you won't be safe." "Well, if it were possible to be there
                    in safety, would you approve?" " Yes, I would rather you did not go to a
                    province either now or after your praetorship; but I don't advise you to trust
                    yourself in Rome." I gave him the reasons that will occur to you, why it would
                    not be safe. Then they kept on bewailing the chances that had been let slip,
                    especially Cassius, and they complained bitterly of Decimus. I said they ought
                    not to harp on the past, but I agreed with them. When I had gone on to explain
                    what ought to have been done, saying nothing new, but what everybody is saying
                    daily, </p>

                <p> and not touching on the point as to whether anyone else ought to have been
                    attacked, but saying that the Senate ought to have been called, the people in
                    their violent excitement ought to have been roused to fury, and the whole
                    conduct of affairs taken over by them, your friend Servilia exclaimed: "That I
                    never heard anyone ..." I interrupted her. But I think Cassius will go (for
                    Servilia promises she will see that that appointment to the corn-supply shall be
                    withdrawn from the senatorial decree): and our friend soon gave up his silly
                    talk of wanting to go to Rome. So he has made up his mind that the games may be
                    held in his absence under his name. I fancy, however, he wants to set out for
                    Asia from Antium. To cut the matter-short, I got nothing that satisfied me out
                    of that journey except the satisfaction to my conscience. For I could not allow
                    him to leave Italy before I had met him. Save for fulfilling the duty I owed to
                    our affection, I could not help asking myself: " What makest thou with thy
                    journey hither, seer?"<note type="footnote" n="1">1 The author of this line,

                    So, although I had no doubt even before, now I have still less that I must fly
                    away from here as fast as possible, "Where I may hear no bruit of Pelops'

                <p> Even you did not like the idea of a votive legation; for indeed it was absurd
                    for me to be fulfilling vows after the constitution was overthrown, which I had
                    made in case it were maintained. I fancy, too, free legations have a limit of
                    time set by one of Caesar's laws, and it is not easy to get it prolonged. I want
                    the kind of legation that lets you come and go as you please, and that I have
                    got now. It is a fine thing, too, to have the privilege for five years. Though
                    why do I think of five years? Things seem to me to be drawing to a crisis: but

                    plainly enough for you not to doubt that they are going to take things quietly
                    and accept Antonius' insulting favour. Cassius rejects the corn-supply job, and
                    Servilia says she will cut it out of the senatorial decree. Our friend is taking
                    things very seriously, now he agrees with me that he cannot be safe in Rome (for
                    he prefers the games to take place in his absence). He says he will go to Asia
                    at once, as soon as he has handed over the management of the games to those who
                    will attend to it. He is collecting vessels, and his heart is set on going.
                    Meantime they will stay in the same places. Brutus says he will be at Astura. L.

                    Bruti have we to thank for this? In Octavianus, as I have observed, there is
                    plenty of wit and plenty of spirit, and he seems likely to be as well disposed
                    to our heroes as we could wish. But it is a grave question how far we can trust
                    one of his age, name, heritage, and bringing up. His father-in-law, whom I saw
                    at Astura, thinks he is not to be trusted at all. However, we must look after
                    him, and, if nothing else, dissociate him from Antonius. Marcellus will be doing
                    well if he inculcates our views into Brutus, to whom Octavianus seems to be well
                    affected. In Pansa and Hirtius, however, he has but little trust. His

                    what I shall do. You say that two legions have arrived at Brundisium: you get
                    all the news first. So you must write whatever you hear. I am expecting Varro's

                    write. For to your own opinion, which I knew, you have added Peducaeus'

                    not to disappoint you in my industry or diligence. I am making much of Vettienus

                    That pretty fellow Dolabella has written to me from Formiae, though, when I was
                    writing this letter at dessert, I heard he had arrived at Baiae, and I got his
                    letter as I left my bath. He says he has done his level best about assigning
                    debts to me. He blames Vettienus—of course he is up to some dodge like a true
                    business man—but he says Sestius, who is a very honest fellow and a good friend
                    of mine, has undertaken the whole affair. Still, I should like to know what on
                    earth Sestius can do in this business that any of us could not have done. But if
                    anything does happen contrary to my expectation, you must let me know; while, if
                    it is, as I suspect, a hopeless business, write all the same: it will not
                    disturb me. I am philosophizing here (what else can I do?) and getting on
                    splendidly with my De Officiis, which I am dedicating to my son. A father could
                    not choose a more appropriate subject. Then I shall turn to other subjects. In
                    fact this excursion will have some works to show for itself. Varro is expected
                    either to-day or to-morrow; but I am hastening to Pompeii, not that anything
                    could be prettier than this place, but I shall be less bothered by interruptions
                    there. But please inform me what the charge was against Myrtilus,<note

                        44</note> On the 26th I received a letter from Dolabella, and I am sending
                    you a copy of it. In it he says he has done everything you wanted. I answered at
                    once, thanking him profusely. However, to prevent his wondering why I should do
                    so twice, I gave as a reason that I had not been able to get any information
                    from you before when I met you. But, to cut it short, here is a copy of my
                    letter:— "CICERO TO HIS FRIEND DOLABELLA THE CONSUL. "Once before, when our
                    friend Atticus had informed me by letter of your great liberality and the great
                    kindness you had shown him, and when you yourself had written that you had done
                    all that we wished, I sent you my thanks couched in such terms that you might
                    understand that you had done me the greatest favour. But afterwards, when
                    Atticus came himself to me at Tusculum solely to declare his gratitude to you,
                    as he had observed your remarkable and indeed wonderful kindness in the matter
                    of the people of Buthrotum and your strong affection for himself, I could not
                    help expressing my thanks again more clearly in this letter. For of all the
                    favours and services you have done for me, and they are overwhelming, my dear
                    Dolabella, let me assure you that the highest and the most gratifying is, that
                    you have shown Atticus how great my affection is for you, and yours for me. For
                    the rest, as one generally wishes to secure favours received, though the case of
                    Buthrotum and its existence as a city have been set on a firm footing by you, I </p>


                <pb n="337"/>
                <p> should like you to use your authority and your power to protect it, as it was
                    put in your care and repeatedly recommended to you by me. That will be
                    sufficient to safeguard Buthrotum for ever, and, if in compliment to me you will
                    undertake to see them always protected, you will relieve Atticus and me of a
                    great care and anxiety: and this I beg and entreat you to do." After finishing
                    this letter I have devoted myself to my treatise. I fear you will run your red
                    pencil under many passages in it. I have been so distracted and hindered by
                    weighty thoughts. <milestone unit="section" n="15"/>XV CICERO TO ATTICUS,

                    is obnoxious to the Buthrotians. I have drawn up a deposition, which shall be

                    to the people of Arpinum, pay it him back in full. In another letter I mentioned
                    the 1,000 guineas to be paid to Statius. Well, if Fadius asks for them, I wish
                    them to be paid to him, but to no one else. I think it was deposited with me. I
                    have written to Eros to pay it. I detest Cleopatra; and the voucher for her
                    promises, Ammonius, knows I have good reason to do so. Her promises were all
                    things that had to do with learning and not derogatory to my dignity, so I could
                    have mentioned them even in a public speech. Sara, besides being a knave, I have
                    noticed is also impertinent to me. Once, and only once, have I </p>


                <pb n="339"/>
                <p> seen him in my house; and then, when I asked politely what he wanted, he said he
                    wanted Attieus. But the insolence of the queen herself, when she was in her
                    villa across the river, I cannot mention without great indignation. So no
                    dealings with them. They don't credit me with any spirit or even any feelings at
                    all. My departure from Italy I see is hindered by Eros' management of my
                    affairs. For, although from the balances he made on April 5 I ought to have
                    plenty of cash, I have to borrow, and I think the receipts from those paying
                    concerns are set aside for the shrine. But I have given Tiro orders about this,
                    and am sending him to Rome on purpose. I did not want to add to your worries.
                    The more moderate in his demands my son is, the more am I concerned about him.
                    For he has not mentioned this point to me, the person of all others to whom of
                    course he ought to have mentioned it; but in a letter to Tiro he said I had sent
                    him nothing since April 1, which was the end of his financial year. Now I know
                    that you, with your usual amiability, have always agreed and indeed thought that
                    among other things my dignity demanded that he should be treated not only
                    liberally, but even with excessive and extravagant liberality. So I should like
                    you to see that he has a bill of exchange for his annual allowance payable at
                    Athens. I would not trouble you, if I could manage it through anyone else. Eros,
                    of course, will pay you. That is why I have sent Tiro. Please see about it and
                    let me know if you have any views on the point. </p>

                    letter. Now hear what I have to say to the second. You are acting as kindly as
                    usual in standing by Servilia, that is to say, Brutus. As to Cleopatra, I am
                    glad you are not anxious and that you accept the evidence. The state of Eros'
                    accounts I have heard from Tiro,:and I have sent for Eros himself. I am most
                    grateful for your promise not to let my son lack in anything. Messalla, on his
                    way back from our adversaries at Lanuvium, called on me with wonderfully good
                    news about him, and upon my word his own letter is so affectionate and
                    well-written that I should not be ashamed to read it before an audience. So I
                    feel all the more indulgently disposed towards him. I don't think Sestius is
                    annoyed about Bucilianus. As soon as Tiro returns home, I am thinking of going
                    to Tusculum. Please let me know at once, if there is anything that I ought to
                    know. </p>

                    tough piece of business, but one has to put up with it, and I am very thankful
                    for it. As to the imminence of war I never saw anything more obvious. So let me
                    flee, and in the way you suggest. I do not know why Theophanes wants to see me,
                    for he wrote to me. I answered as best I could. But he writes saying he wants to
                    come to me to discuss his own affairs and some that concern me. I am looking for
                    a letter from you. Pray see that nothing is done rashly. Statius has written to
                    me saying my nephew Quintus has told him with emphasis that he cannot put up
                    with things, and has resolved to go over to Brutus and Cassius. Here is
                    something I am very eager to understand: here is a puzzle I can't interpret.
                    Perhaps he is angry with Antony about something; perhaps he is looking for some
                    new way of distinguishing himself; or perhaps it is all bunkum; and no doubt
                    that is what it is. But for all that I am afraid, and his father is disturbed
                    about him, for he knows what he used to say about Antony; indeed, he said things
                    to me which I cannot repeat. What on earth he means I can't think. I shall only
                    have such commissions as I choose from Dolabella, that is, none at all. Tell me
                    if C. Antonius wanted to be put on the land commission.<note type="footnote"

                    Vettienus; for nothing could have been kinder. Let Dolabella give me what
                    commissions he will, provided I have something, even a message to Nicias. For,
                    as you say, who will deny it? Can any sane man doubt now that I am going away in
                    despair, not on a mission? You say that people, aye, even good citizens, are
                    talking of desperate political measures. I began to have my doubts on the day
                    that I heard that tyrant called " a most distinguished man." Afterwards, when I
                    was with you at Lanuvium and saw that our friends had precisely so much hope of
                    life as Antony gave them, I lost all hope. So, my dear Atticus, 1 hope you will
                    take what I am going to say with the same courage as I write it. As I think the
                    kind of death towards which the current of affairs is setting is disgraceful and
                    hold that we are practically condemned to it by Antony, I have decided to escape
                    from the toils, not so much to escape as in hope of a better death. All this is
                    Brutus' fault. You say Pompeius has been received at Carteia. So there will soon
                    be an army sent against him. Then which camp am I to choose? For Antony makes
                    neutrality impossible. That is weak, this is criminal. So let me hasten away.
                    But give me your counsel whether to sail from Brundisium or Puteoli. Brutus does
                    wisely to go, but it is sudden. I am rather upset about it, for when shall I see
                    him again? But such is life. You yourself cannot see him. Heaven confound that
                    dead man for ever touching Buthrotum. But away with the past; let us see what
                    has to be done. </p>


                <pb n="351"/>
                <p> Though I have not yet seen Eros, from his letters and from what Tiro found out I
                    know pretty well how his accounts stand. You say I must raise a fresh loan for
                    some £2,000 for five months, that is, till the 1st of November, when Quintus'
                    debt falls due. So, since Tiro says you do not want me to come to Rome on
                    purpose for that, if you do not mind, I should be glad if you would see where I
                    can get the money, and put it down on my account. I see it is necessary for the
                    present. I will enquire more closely into the rest from Eros himself, among
                    other things about the rents of Terentia's dower property. If they are properly
                    looked after for my son he will be pretty well provided for, though I want him
                    to be more liberally treated. I see I shall want some journey-money myself; but
                    he can get the rents of the property as they fall due, whereas I shall require a
                    lump sum. I certainly shall not leave until the money has been paid, though that

                    been arranged or not, I shall learn when I see you. I thought I had better write
                    this myself, and so I have done so. As you say about Fadius: the money must not
                    go to anyone else in any case. Please answer by return. <milestone

                    jumping for joy. For his son has written saying that his reason for wanting to
                    take refuge with Brutus is, that, when Antony asked him to secure him the
                    dictatorship and seize some fort, he refused, and the reason for </p>


                <pb n="353"/>
                <p> his refusal was that he did not want to hurt his father's feelings; and from
                    that time Antony has been his enemy. " Then," he says, " I pulled myself
                    together for fear that he should do you some mischief in his wrath with me; and
                    so I smoothed him down, and indeed got £4,000<note type="footnote" n="1">1 400

                    says he wants to live with his father—which is a wonder— and my brother is
                    delighted about it. Did you ever see a more thorough rascal? I approve of your
                    hesitation in the arrangement with Canus.<note type="footnote" n="2">2
                        Apparently there were negotiations for a marriage between young Quintus and
                        Canus' daughter, who had lately been divorced. Cf. XIII. 41.</note> I had no
                    idea about the documents: I thought her dowry had been paid back in full. I
                    shall look forward to the matters you refrain from mentioning till we meet. Keep
                    the messengers as long as you like, as you are busy. As to Xeno, quite right.
                    What I am writing I will send when it is finished. You told Quintus you had sent
                    him a letter, but none has been brought as yet. Tiro says you disapprove of
                    Brundisium now, and indeed says something about soldiers. But I have already
                    fixed upon Hydrus. Your saying that it was only a five-hour passage decided me.
                    Think of the endless voyage from here. But we shall see. I had no letter from
                    you on the 21st. Of course, for what news can there be now? Come, then, as soon
                    as you can. I am in a hurry, for Sextus may get here before I leave. They say he

                    he will oppose Antony: but when and how? How long are we to be fooled? I said
                    Sextus was coming, not because he was already near, but because he certainly has
                    it in mind, and does not show the least sign of laying down his arms. Certainly,
                    if he goes on, war must come. But our good lover of Cytheris<note

                    could in Quintus' business. He, however, is in distress and doubt as to whether
                    he shall oblige Lepta or damage his son's credit. I have heard a rumour that L.
                    Piso wants to go on a mission with a forged decree of the senate. I should like
                    to know what there is in it. The messenger I told you I had sent to Brutus came
                    to me at Anagnia on the night of the 30th of June, and brought me a letter in
                    which there was one request quite unlike his usual common-sense, the same old
                    request that I should be present at his games. I answered, of course, firstly
                    that I had already set out now, so that it was not in my power to do so, and
                    secondly that it would be most out of place for me, who have not been near Rome
                    at all since the outbreak of war— not so much to preserve my safety as to
                    preserve my dignity—suddenly to go to the games. For at such a time it was
                    honourable for him to give the games, since he had to do so, but, as there was
                    no necessity for me to attend them, it would not be honourable for me to do so.
                    Of course I keenly desire that they should be well attended and very popular,
                    and I trust they will be; and I beg you to send me a description of how these
                    games and all the other games are received day by day from the very beginning.
                    But enough of the games. The rest of the letter is, one must confess, of rather
                    a dubious kind, but still he does at times emit some sparks of manly courage.
                    That you may judge for yourself what it is like, I have sent you a copy of the

                    forwarded to you from Tusculum. I have arranged my journeys so that I shall be
                    at Puteoli on the 7th of July; for, though I am in a great hurry, I mean to take
                    every care humanly possible in my voyage. Please relieve M. Aelius of his
                    anxiety. Tell him I thought that on a few feet at the far end of the land there
                    might be some sort of claims, and those only underground. Also that I have not
                    the slightest desire for it, and that I don't value water at that price.<note
                        type="footnote" n="1" place="opposite">1 The reading and meaning of this
                        passage is uncertain. Apparently either Cicero had asserted some claim on
                            some<pb n="361"/> underground water-pipes on property of Aelius
                        adjoining his own, and was now disclaiming it; or Aelius had been
                        commissioned to buy property for Cicero on which there was a disputed claim
                        to such pipes, and Cicero refuses to purchase on that ground. Servitus above
                        is used in the technical legal sense of an " easement " or liability on

                    to relieve him of anxiety than to suggest that I am in the least annoyed. Again,
                    about that debt of Tullius: speak to Cascellius frankly. It is a small matter,
                    but I am glad you attended to it. There was too much trickery about it: and, if
                    he had cheated me at all, which he very nearly did if you had not been too sharp
                    for him, I should have been very much annoyed. So, whatever happens, I would
                    rather the matter were broken off. Remember that an eighth share of the houses
                    of Tullius near the temple of Strenia is due to Caerellia, and see that it is
                    conveyed to her at the highest price bid at the auction. I think that was some
                    3,000 guineas.<note type="footnote" n="2">2 380 sestertia. On this debt cf. Att.
                        XII. 51.</note> If there is any news, and, even if you foresee anything you
                    think likely to happen, I should like you to write to me as often as possible.

                    the same messenger, to whom I gave the letter I sent you on the 2nd, I also gave
                    another for Sestius, written in very friendly terms. It is very good of him to
                    follow me to Puteoli, but he has no grounds for his complaint. For it was not my
                    business to wait for his return from Cosa, so much as it was his not to go until
                    he had seen me, or to return more quickly. He knew I wanted to start in a hurry,
                    and he told me he would come to me at Tusculum. I am grieved that you wept when
                    you left me. If you had done so in my presence, I might have changed all my
                    plans about going. But there is one good thing, that you were consoled by the
                    thought of meeting me again soon; and that, indeed, is the hope that buoys me

                    as far as Puteoli —what a noble citizen! you might call him a Favonius
                        Asinius.<note type="footnote" n="1" place="opposite">1 Favonius was a

                    He has two reasons: he wants to be with me and to make peace with Brutus and
                    Cassius. But what have you to say to this? For I know you are intimate with the
                    Othones. He says that Julia proposed it herself, for a divorce has been
                    arranged. His father has asked me what sort of reputation she has. Not knowing
                    why he asked, I said I had never heard anything about her except about her looks

                    though I was disgusted, I said I did not believe in those reports. My brother's
                    point is not to offer him any allowance, but she says it is no business of his.
                    I suspect, however, he is indulging in fairy tales as usual. Still I should like
                    you to make enquiries, which will be no trouble to you, and let me know. What,
                    pray, is this? When I had already sealed this letter, some Formians, who were
                    dining with me, said they had seen Plancus<note type="footnote" n="2"

                    from Buthrotus—the day before I wrote this, that is, on the 5th, with downcast

                    and the land-grabbers had been ejected by the Buthrotians. Well done they! But
                    pray let me know all the circumstances. </p>

                <p> Bruto tuae litterae gratae erant. Fui enim apud illum multas horas in Neside,
                    cum paulo ante tuas litteras accepissem. Delectari mihi Tereo videbatur et
                    habere maiorem Accio quam Antonio gratiam. Mihi autem quo laetiora sunt, eo plus
                    stomachi et molestiae est populum Romanum manus suas non in defendenda re
                    publica, sed in plaudendo consumere. Mihi quidem videntur istorum animi incendi
                    etiam ad repraesentandam improbitatem suam. Sed tamen, "dúm modo doleant
                    áliquid, doleant quídlibet." Consilium meum quod ais cotidie magis laudari,' non
                    moleste fero, exspectabamque, si quid de eo ad me scriberes. Ego enim in varios
                    sermones incidebam. Quin etiam idcirco trahebant, ut quam diutissime integrum
                    esset. Sed, quoniam furcilla extrudimur, Brundisium cogito. Facilior enim et
                    exploratior devitatio legionum fore videtur quam piratarum, qui apparere

                    res conveniret, nostri Romam redirent. Addebant etiam me desiderari,
                    subaccusari. Quae cum audissem, sine ulla dubitatione abieci consilium
                    profectionis, quo mehercule ne antea quidem delectabar. Lectis vero tuis
                    litteris admiratus equidem sum te tam vehementer sententiam commutasse, sed non
                    sine causa arbitrabar. Etsi, quamvis non fueris suasor et impulsor profectionis
                    meae, adprobator certe fuisti, dum modo Kal. Ian. Romae essem. Ita fiebat, ut,

                    etiamsi non prudenter, tamen ἀνεμέσητα sunt, primum! quod de mea sententia acta

                    tibi tum relinquere videbar? Tu id non modo non inhibebas, verum etiam

                    opus fuisset. " At hoc ipsum non constanter." Nemo doctus umquam (multa autem de
                    hoc genere scripta sunt) mutationem consilii inconstantiam dixit esse. Deinceps
                    igitur haec: " Nam, si a Phaedro nostro esses, expedita excusatio esset; nunc
                    quid respondemus?" Ergo id erat meum factum, quod Catoni probare non possem?
                    flagitii scilicet plenum et dedecoris. Utinam a primo ita tibi esset visum! tu
                    mihi, sicut esse soles, fuisses Cato. Extremum illud vel molestissimum: "Nam
                    Brutus noster silet," hoc est: non audet hominem id aetatis monere. Aliud nihil
                    habeo, quod ex iis a te verbis significari putem, et hercule ita est. Nam, XVI
                    Kal. Sept. cum venissem Veliam, Brutus audivit; erat enim cum suis navibus apud
                    Heletem fluvium citra Veliam mil. pass. III. Pedibus ad me statim. Dei
                    immortales, quam valde ille reditu vel potius reversione mea Iactatus effudit

                    Maxime autem dolebat me Kal. Sext. in senatu non fuisse. Pisonem ferebat in
                    caelum; se autem laetari, quod effugissem duas maximas vituperationes, unam,
                    quam itinere faciendo me intellegebam suscipere, desperationis ac relictionis

                    probabam), alteram, de qua Brutus, et qui una erant (multi autem erant),

                    turpius quovis rei publicae tempore, sed hoc ἀναπολόγητον. Ego vero austro
                    gratias miras, qui me a tanta infamia averterit. Reversionis has speciosas
                    causas habes, iustas illas quidem et magnas; sed nulla iustior, quam quod tu
                    idem aliis litteris: " Provide, si cui quid debetur, ut sit, unde par pari
                    respondeatur. Mirifica enim δυσχρηστία est propter metum armorum." In freto
                    medio hanc epistulam legi, ut, quid possem providere, in mentem mihi non
                    veniret, nisi ut praesens me ipse defenderem. Sed haec hactenus; reliqua coram.
                    Antoni edictum legi a Bruto et horum contra scriptum praeclare; sed, quid ista
                    edicta valeant aut quo spectent, plane non video. Nec ego nunc, ut Brutus
                    censebat, istuc ad rem publicam capessendam venio. Quid enim fieri potest? Num
                    quis Pisoni est adsensus? num rediit ipse postridie? Sed abesse hanc aetatem
                    longe a sepulcro negant oportere. Sed, obsecro te, quid est, quod audivi de
                    Bruto? Piliam πειράζεσθαι te scripsisse aiebat. Valde sum commotus. Etsi idem te

                    studiosum esse cognovi, mei vero ita cupidum, ut mehercule paucos aeque
                    observantes atque amantes me habere existimem. Ad paternas enim magnas et
                    veteres et iustas necessitudines magnam attulit accessionem tua voluntas erga me
                    meaque erga te par atque mutua. Buthrotia tibi causa ignota non est. Egi enim
                    saepe de ea re tecum tibique totam rem demonstravi; quae est acta hoc modo. Ut
                    primum Buthrotium agrum proscriptum vidimus, commotus Atticus libellum
                    composuit. Eum mihi dedit, ut darem Caesari; eram enim cenaturus apud eum illo
                    die. Eum libellum Caesari dedi. Probavit causam, rescripsit Attico aequa eum
                    postulare, admonuit tamen, ut pecuniam reliquam Buthrotii ad diem solverent.
                    Atticus, qui civitatem conservatam cuperet, pecuniam numeravit' de suo. Quod cum
                    esset factum, adiimus ad Caesarem, verba fecimus pro Buthrotiis, liberalissimum
                    decretum abstulimus; quod est obsignatum ab amplissimis viris. Quae cum essent
                    acta, mirari equidem solebam pati Caesarem convenire eos, qui agrum Buthrotium
                    concupissent, neque solum pati, sed etianu ei negotio te praeficere. Itaque et
                    ego cum illo locutus sum et saepius quidem, ut etiam accusare ab eo, quod parum
                    constantiae suae confiderem, et M. Messallae et ipsi Attico dixit, ut sine cura
                    essent! </p>

                    offendere nolle; cum autem mare transissent, curaturum se, ut in alium agrum
                    deducerentur. Haec illo vivo. Post interitum autem Caesaris, ut primum ex
                    senatus consulto causas consules cognoscere instituerunt, haec, quae supra
                    scripsi, ad eos delata sunt. Probaverunt causam sine ulla dubitatione seque ad
                    te litteras daturos esse dixerunt. Ego autem, mi Plance, etsi non dubitabam,
                    quin et senatus consultum et lex et consulum decretum ac litterae apud te
                    plurimum auctoritatis haberent, teque ipsius Attici causa velle intellexeram,

                    peterem, quod tua singularis humanitas suavissimique mores a te essent
                    impetraturi. Id autem est, ut hoc, quod te tua sponte facturum esse certo scio,
                    honoris nostri causa libenter, prolixe, celeriter facias. Mihi nemo est amicior
                    nec iucundior nec carior Attico. Cuius antea res solum familiaris agebatur eaque
                    magna, nunc accessit etiam existimatio, ut, quod consecutus est magna et
                    industria et gratia et vivo Caesare et mortuo, id te adiuvante obtineat. Quod si
                    a te erit impetratum, sic velim existimes, me de tua liberalitate ita
                    interpretaturum, ut tuo summo beneficio me adfectum iudicem. Ego, quae te velle

                    TO ATTICUS, GREETING. <note n="marg">Puteoli, July 8, B.C. 44</note> On the 7th
                    of Quinctilis I arrived at Puteoli, and I am writing this on the following day
                    as I am crossing to Brutus at Nesis. The day 1 arrived Eros brought me your
                    letter as I was dining. Is it really so? The 9th of July?1 Heaven confound them!
                    But I could go on cursing all day. Could they have insulted Brutus worse than
                    with their July?<note type="footnote" n="1" place="opposite">1 The month
                        Quinctilis had recently been renamed Julius after Caesar, who was born in
                        that month.</note> So I must fall back on my old cry, "How long, O Lord?" I
                    have never seen anything like that. But what, pray, is this I hear about the
                    land-grabbers being cut to pieces at Buthrotum? And why has Plancus been on the
                    run, as they tell me he has, day and night? I am very eager to know what it
                    means. I am glad my departure is approved; I must see whether my staying may be
                    approved too. That the people of Dyme, now they have been expelled from their
                    land, should take to piracy is no wonder. There may be some safeguard in having
                    Brutus as a fellow-passenger, but I think his vessels are small. I shall know
                    soon and will tell you to-morrow. I think the report about Ventidius is a false
                    alarm. It is held pretty certain that Sextus is laying down his arms; and, if
                    that is so, it looks as though we should be reduced to slavery without even a
                    civil war. What </p>

                <pb n="371"/>
                <p> hope have we, then? In Pansa, when he enters office? There is nothing but
                    midsummer madness in their drunken dreams. About the £2,000<note type="footnote"
                        n="1">1 210 sestertia.</note>: well done! Put my son's affairs straight. For
                    Ovius has just come, and brings much satisfactory news; among other things, what
                    is no bad hearing, that £700<note type="footnote" n="2">2 72 sestertia.</note>
                    is enough, quite enough, but that Xeno treats him very sparingly and niggardly.
                    The excess over the rental of the town houses that your bill of exchange cost,
                    may be reckoned to the year, in which there was the additional expense of the
                    journey. From the 1st of April on let him have up to £800,<note type="footnote"
                        n="3">3 80 sestertia.</note> for that is the rent of the city property now.
                    Some sort of provision must be made for him when he comes to Rome. For I don't
                    think he could endure that woman as a mother-in-law. I refused Pindarus' offer
                    for the villa at Cumae. Now let me tell you why I have sent a messenger. Young
                    Quintus is promising to be as prim as a puritan: and both he and his father have
                    begged me to go bail to you for him, but on the condition that you only believe
                    it when you see it. I shall give him a letter according to his fancy, but don't
                    take any notice of it. I am writing now to prevent you from thinking that I do.
                    God grant he keeps his promise. It would be a satisfaction to everybody. But I—I
                    won't say any more. He is leaving on the 9th. For he says there is some money to
                    be paid over on the 15th, but that he is very hard pressed. You will judge from
                    my letter how to answer. More when I have seen Brutus and am sending Eros back.
                    I accept dear Attica's apology and send her my best love. Give my regards to her
                    and Pilia. </p>

                        >Puteoli, July 11, B.C. 44</note> On the 10th I received two letters, one by
                    my own messenger, another from Brutus'. Here the story about the Buthrotians was
                    very different; but that, like many other things, we must put up with. I have
                    sent Eros back sooner than I intended, that there may be someone to pay
                    Hortensius and Ovia, with whom, indeed, he says he had made an appointment for
                    the 15th. It is really shameless of Hortensius, for there is nothing owing to
                    him except on the third instalment, which is due on the 1st of August; and the
                    greater part of that instalment has been paid some time before the proper date.
                    But Eros will see to that on the 15th. In Publilius' case I don't think there
                    ought to be any delay in letting him have a draft, for what is owing. But, when
                    you see how much I have yielded my rights in paying up half of a balance of
                        £4,000<note type="footnote" n="1">1 400 sestertia. The money was a repayment
                        of the dowry Cicero had received with his second wife, whom he had since
                        divorced.</note> in ready money, and now giving a bill for the rest, you
                    may, if you think fit, tell him that he ought to await my convenience, when I
                    have waived so much of my rights. But please, my dear Atticus—see how coaxingly
                    I put it—do transact, regulate, and manage all my affairs while you are in Rome,
                    without waiting for a hint from me. For though I have sufficient outstanding
                    debts to meet my creditors, it often happens that the debtors don't pay at the
                    proper time. If anything of that sort happens, consider nothing so much as my
                    credit. Preserve it not only by raising a fresh loan, but by selling if
                    necessary. </p>

                <pb n="375"/>
                <p> Brutus was pleased with your letter. I spent several hours with him at Nesis,
                    just after I received your letter. He seemed to be delighted at the Tereus
                    incident, and to feel more grateful to Accius than to Antonius.<note
                        type="footnote" n="1" place="opposite">1 There had been some exhibition of
                        public feeling at the performance of Accius' Tereus at the games given by
                        Brutus. Here, and in the Philippics II. 31, it is implied that it was<pb
                            n="375"/> favourable to Brutus, but Appius, B.C. in. 24, states that
                        outbursts against Caesar's assassins drove them to decide on leaving
                        Italy.</note> For my part the better the news is, the more it annoys and
                    pains me, that the Roman people use their hands not for defending the
                    constitution but for clapping. It seems to me that the Caesarian party is
                    possessed of a positive mania for parading its disloyalty. However, "so they but
                    suffer, be it what it will."<note type="footnote" n="2">2 From Afranius. Cf.
                        Cicero, Tuse. Disp. iv. 45 and 55.</note> You say my plan is daily more
                    commended. I am not sorry, and I am looking forward to anything you may say
                    about it. For I have met with various opinions; and, indeed, for that reason I
                    am hesitating as long as possible before committing myself. But since I am being
                    turned out with a pitchfork, I am thinking of Brundisium. For it seems to me to
                    be more certain and easier to avoid the soldiers than the pirates, who are said
                    to be in evidence. I expected Sestius on the 10th, but he has not come, so far
                    as I know. Cassius has arrived with his little fleet. When I have seen him, I am
                    thinking of going on the 11th to Pompeii, and thence to Aeculanum. You know the
                    rest. About Tutia, that is what I thought. As for Aebutius, I don't believe it;
                    nor do I care any more than you do. I have written of course to Plancus and
                    Oppius, as you asked me: but, if you think better of it, don't hold yourself
                    bound to deliver the letters. For, since they have done it all for your sake, I
                    fear my letters </p>

                <pb n="377"/>
                <p> may appear superfluous to them—to Oppius at any rate, as I know he is a great
                    admirer of yours. But just as you please. As you say you are going to spend the
                    winter in Epirus, I shall take it kindly if you will come before the time at
                    which you advise me to return to Italy. Send me letters as often as possible; if
                    on matters of little importance, by any messenger you can find; but if on
                    important affairs, send some one of your own. I will attempt a work in
                    Heracleides' style, if I get safe to Brundisium. I am sending you my De Gloria.
                    Please keep it as usual, but have select passages marked for Salvius to read
                    when he has an appropriate party to dinner. I am very pleased with them, and I
                    hope you will he too. Farewell, and yet again farewell. <milestone

                        >Pompeii,July 17, B.C 44</note> At last I am answering the letter you sent
                    me after meeting Antony at Tibur. Well, then, you. were wise in giving in and
                    even going so far as to thank him. For certainly, as you say, we shall be robbed
                    of our constitution before we are robbed of our private property. So you take
                    more and more delight in my treatise on Old Age daily. That increases my energy
                    in writing. You say you expect Eros not to come to you empty-handed. I am glad
                    you have not been disappointed in the event; but at the same time 1 am sending
                    you the same composition more carefully revised, indeed the original copy, with
                    plenty of additions between the lines and corrections. Have it copied on large
                    paper and read it privately to your guests; but, if you love me, do it </p>

                <pb n="379"/>
                <p> when they are in a good temper and have had a good dinner, for I don't want them
                    to vent on me the anger they feel towards you. In my son's case I hope things
                    may be as we hear. About Xeno I shall know when I see him, though I don't
                    suppose he is neglecting his duty or acting meanly. I will do as you say about
                    Herodes, and «iii find out what you mention from Saufeius and Xeno. As for young
                    Quintus, I am glad my letter was delivered by my messenger sooner than the one
                    he took himself, though you would not have been taken in anyhow. However—but I
                    am anxious to hear what he said to you and what you answered, though I have no
                    doubt you both behaved characteristically. I hope Curius will deliver that
                    letter to me. Though he is pleasant enough and I like him myself, still your
                    recommendation will add the crowning grace. "I have answered your letter
                    sufficiently; now hear what I am going to say, though I know there is no
                    necessity for me to say it. In regard to my journey I am distressed about many
                    things, the chief being that I am separated from you. Then again there is the
                    fatigue of the voyage, a thing unsuitable not only to my age but to my rank too,
                    and the time of my departure is rather ridiculous. For I am leaving peace to
                    return to war, and wasting in travelling time that might be spent in my country
                    houses, which are comfortably built and pleasantly situated. My consolations are
                    these. I shall either benefit my son or see how much he can be benefited. Then
                    again, as I hope and as you promise, you will soon be coming too; and if that
                    happens it will make me far happier. But the thing that worries me most is the
                    arranging of my balances; for, though things </p>

                <pb n="381"/>
                <p> have been put straight, I am anxious when I see Dolabella's name among them, and
                    drafts on people that I do not know among my assets: and that makes me more
                    uneasy than anything else. So I don't think I was wrong in applying to Balbus
                    quite openly to assist me, if such a thing should happen as my debts not coming
                    in properly, and telling him that I had commissioned you to communicate with him
                    in any such event. Do so, if you think fit, especially if you are starting for
                    Epirus. This I have written just as I was embarking from Pompeii with three
                    ten-oared pinnaces. Brutus is still in Nesis, Cassius at Naples. Can you like
                    Deiotarus and not like Hieras?<note type="footnote" n="1" place="opposite">1
                        Hieras and Blesamius were agents of Deiotarus in bribing Antony to restore

                    as she is: I was so pleased with the good wishes she sent me through you. So

                    would take two days going—I went to Nesis on the 8th: and there was Brutus. How

                        XVI. 1.</note> It quite upset him. So he said he would send orders for them
                    to advertise the beast-hunt, which is to take place on the day after the games
                    to Apollo, as on the "13th of Quinctilis." Libo came in, and he </p>

                <pb n="383"/>
                <p> told us that Philo, a freedman of Pompey, and Hilarus, one of his own, had come
                    from Sextus with a letter for the consuls, " or whatever they call them." He
                    read us a copy to see what we thought of it. There were a few odd expressions,
                    but in other respects it was sufficiently dignified and not aggressive. We only
                    thought it better to make an addition of "Praetors, Tribunes of the People, and
                    Senate" to the simple address to the "Consuls," for fear they should not publish
                    a letter sent to them. They say that Sextus has been at Carthage with only one
                    legion, and that he received the news about Caesar on the very day that he took
                    the town of Barea. After the capture there were great rejoicings and a change of
                    sentiment, and people flocked to him from every side, but he returned to the six
                    legions he had left in lower Spain. He has written to Libo himself saying it is
                    all nothing to him if he cannot get home. The upshot of his demands is, that all
                    the armies everywhere should be disbanded. That is all about Sextus. I have been
                    making enquiries in every direction about the Buthrotians, and discover nothing.
                    Some say the land-grabbers were cut to pieces, others that Plancus pocketed the
                    money and fled, leaving them in the lurch. So I don't see how I can find out
                    what there is in it, unless I get a letter at once. The route to Brundisium,
                    about which I was hesitating, seems to be out of the question. They say the
                    troops are arriving there. But the voyage from here has some suspicion of
                    danger, so I have made up my mind to sail in company with Brutus. I found him
                    better prepared than I had heard he was. For both he and Domitius have quite
                    good two-banked galleys, and there are also some good ships belonging </p>

                <pb n="385"/>
                <p> to Sestus, Bucilianus, and others. For I don't count on Cassius' fleet, which is
                    quite a fine one, beyond the straits of Sicily. There is one point that annoys
                    me a little, Brutus seems in no hurry. First he is waiting for news of the
                    completion of his games; then, so far as I can understand, he is going to sail
                    slowly, stopping at several places. Still I think it will be better to sail
                    slowly than not to sail at all; and if, when we have got some distance, things
                    seem clearer, we shall take advantage of the Etesian winds. <milestone

                        supposed it was the play called Brutus, whereas it was the Tereus.</note>
                    There had, however, been some breath of rumour that at the opening of the Greek
                    games the audience was small, at which, indeed, I was not at all surprised; for
                    you know what I think of Greek games. Now hear the most important point of all.
                    Quintus has been with me several days, and, if I had desired, he would have
                    stayed longer; but, so far as his visit went, you would not believe how pleased
                    I was with him in every way, and especially in that in which I used most to
                    disapprove of him. For he is so totally changed, partly by some works of mine,
                    which I have in hand, and partly by my continual advice and exhortation, that he
                    will in the future be as loyal as we could wish to the constitution. After he
                    had not only asseverated this, but convinced me </p>

                <pb n="387"/>
                <p> of it, he was very pressing for me to go bail to you that he will come up to
                    your and our expectations for the future; and he did not ask you to believe this
                    at once, but that you should restore your affection to him, when you had seen it
                    for yourself. If he had not convinced me of it, and I did not think that what I
                    am saying is trustworthy, I should not have done what I am going to tell you. I
                    took the young man with me to Brutus, and he was so convinced of what I mention
                    that he believed it on his own account, refusing to hold me sponsor for Quintus.
                    He praised him and mentioned you in the most friendly way, and dismissed him
                    with an embrace and a kiss. So, although there is more reason for congratulating
                    you than asking favours of you, still I do ask you, if you have regarded his
                    actions up to now as showing some of the flightiness of youth, to believe that
                    lie has - got rid of that, and to trust me that your influence will contribute
                    much, or rather everything, towards making his decision permanent. I have
                    frequently thrown out a hint to Brutus about sailing with him, but he does not
                    seem to jump at it as I thought he would. He seemed to me rather distrait, and
                    indeed he was, especially about the games. But when I got back home, Lucceius,
                    who is very intimate with him, said he was hesitating a good deal, not because
                    he has changed his mind, but in the hope that something may turn up. So I am
                    wondering whether to make for Venusia and there await news of the troops. If
                    they are not there, as some think, I shall go to Hydrus; if 'neither road is
                    safe, I will come back here. Do you think I am joking? Upon my life you are the
                    only person who keeps me here. Just look round you, but do it before I
                        blush.<note type="footnote" n="1" place="opposite">1 Possibly there is some

                    house at Vibo, and at present I have taken it easy and not exerted myself. We
                    have rowed most of the way, as there have been none of the usual north
                        winds.<note type="footnote" n="2" place="opposite">2 North-north-east winds,

                    there were two bays to cross, that of Paestum and that of Vibo. We crossed both
                    with the wind behind us.<note type="footnote" n="3">3 The pedes were ropes

                    eight days after leaving Pompeii, having stopped one day at Velia. There I
                    stayed at Talna's house very enjoyably, and I could not have been more liberally
                    entertained, especially as he was away. So I got to Sicca on the 24th, and here
                    I am quite at home. So I have stayed a day longer than I meant. But I think,

                    to proceed by a merchant vessel to Patrae or by packet-boats to Tarentine
                    Leucopetra, and thence to Corcyra; and, if by a merchant ship, whether direct
                    from the Sicilian strait or from Syracuse. On this point I will write to you
                    from Regium. Upon my word, Atticus, I often say to myself: " Why, what avails
                    thee all thy journey here?"<note type="footnote" n="1" place="opposite">1 A
                        verse from an unknown author, quoted in a fuller form in Att. xv. 11.</note>
                    Why am not I with you? Why may I not see my country houses, the jewels of Italy?
                    But that alone is enough and more than enough, that I am not with you. And what
                    am I fleeing from? Danger? Nay, unless I am mistaken, there is no danger now.
                    For it is precisely at the hour of danger that you bid me come back. For you say
                    my departure is praised to the skies, provided I return by the end of the year;
                    and that I will certainly strive to do. For I had rather be at home in fear and
                    trembling, than in vour loved Athens without a fear. However, keep your eye on
                    the trend of events, and write to me, or what I should much prefer, bring the
                    news yourself. Enough of this. Please take my next request in good part. I know
                    you devote more care to it than I do myself. For mercy's sake keep my accounts
                    clear and pay my debts. I have left a handsome balance; but it requires care to
                    see to the payment of my fellow-heirs for the Cluvian property on the 1st of
                    August. You will see how to manage about Publilius. He ought not to be pressing,
                    as I am not insisting upon my legal rights. Still I should much like him also to
                    be satisfied. As to Terentia, what am I to say? Pay her even before the proper
                    date, if you can. But if, as I hope, you are coming soon to Epirus, pray make </p>

                    and leave them paid. But of this enough, and I fear you may think too much. Now
                    I must confess my carelessness. I sent you the work On Glory. But the preface to
                    it is the same as that to the third book of the Academics. That is due to my
                    having a volume of prefaces, from which I select one when I have begun a
                    composition. So, when I was at Tusculum, forgetting I had used that preface, I
                    put it into the book I sent you. But when I was reading the Academics on the
                    boat I noticed my mistake. So I dashed off a new preface at once, and have sent
                    it to you. Please cut the other off and glue this on. Pay my respects to Pilia
                    and to my pet and darling Attica. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>VII CICERO TO

                        B.C. 44</note> When I had started from Leucopetra—for that was where I began
                    my crossing—on the sixth of August and gone some forty miles, I was driven back
                    to Leucopetra again by a strong south wind. While I was waiting there for the
                    wind—our friend Valerius has a house there, so I was at home and enjoying
                    myself—there came some men of mark of Regium, fresh from Rome, among them a
                    guest of our friend Brutus, who said he had left Brutus at Naples. They brought
                    an edict of Brutus and Cassius and news that there would be a full meeting of
                    the House on the first of the month and that a letter had been sent by Brutus
                    and Cassius to the ex- </p>

                <pb n="395"/>
                <p> consuls and ex-praetors»asking them to be present. They said there were great
                    hopes that Antony might yield, some agreement be arrived at, and our friends
                    allowed to return to Rome; and they added that I was missed and people were
                    inclined to blame me. When I heard that, I had no hesitation about giving up my
                    idea of going away, which to be sure I had never fancied even before that: and
                    when I read your letter, I was certainly surprised that you had so utterly
                    changed your opinion; but there seemed to me to be good reason for it. However,
                    though it was not you who persuaded and urged me to go, you certainly approved
                    of my going, if I got back by the end of the year. That would have meant, that,
                    when there was little danger, I should have been away, and should return when it
                    was in full blaze. But that, although it was not a counsel of prudence, I have
                    no right to resent, first because it happened by my own wish, and secondly, even
                    if you had advised me, an adviser need not guarantee anything but his sincerity.
                    What did astonish me beyond measure was that you should use the words: " A fine
                    thing for you, who talk of a noble death, a fine thing, i' faith. Go, desert
                    your country." Was I deserting it, or did you at the time think I was deserting
                    it? You not only raised no finger against it, you even approved of it. The rest
                    is even more severe: “I wish you would write me an explanatory note showing that
                    it was your duty to do it?” So, my dear Atticus? Does my action need defending,
                    especially to you, who expressed strong approval? Yes, I will write a defence,
                    but for some of those who opposed my going and spoke against it. </p>

                <pb n="397"/>
                <p> Though what need is there of an explanatory note? If I had gone on, there would
                    have been. "But coming back is not consistent." No philosopher ever called a
                    change of plan inconsistency, though there has been a good deal written on the
                    point. So you add: " If you were a follower of our friend Phaedrus,<note
                        type="footnote" n="1">1 An Epicurean philosopher at Athens; cf. Ad Fam.
                        XIII. 1.</note> one would have a defence ready: but, as it is, what answer
                    can one give?" So my deed was one Cato would not approve of, was it? Of course
                    then it was criminal and disgraceful. Would to heaven you had thought so 'at
                    first; you should have been my Cato, as you usually are. Your last cut is the
                    most unkind of all: " For our friend Brutus holds his peace," that is to say, he
                    does not dare remonstrate with a man of my age. I see no other meaning that I
                    can attach to your words, and no doubt that is it. For on the 17th, when I
                    reached Velia, Brutus heard of it—he was with his boats on the river Heles about
                    three miles from Velia; and he came at once on foot to see me. Great heavens,
                    how he let out all his pent-up silence in joy at my return or rather my turning
                    back. I could not help thinking of your "Our friend Brutus holds his peace." But
                    what he regretted most was that I was not in the House on the first of August.
                    Piso he lauded to the skies: and he expressed his delight that I had escaped two
                    grounds for reproach. One of these was that of despairing and abandoning the
                    country— and that I knew I might incur in undertaking the voyage; for many had
                    complained to me with tears in their eyes, and I could not convince them of my
                    speedy return. The other point that rejoiced Brutus and those who were with him
                    —and there </p>

                <pb n="399"/>
                <p> were a lot of them—was that I had escaped the reproach of being thought to be
                    going to the Olympian games. Nothing could . be more disgraceful than that in
                    any political circumstances, but at the present time it would be inexcusable. Ι
                    of course feit very grateful to the south wind, which had saved me from such
                    infamy. There you have the ostensible reasons for my return; and they are good
                    and sufficient reasons too; but none of them is better than one you mention in
                    your letter: "If you owe anything to anyone, take measures to provide yourself
                    with the means to pay each his due. For the money market is wonderfully tight
                    owing to fear of war." I was in the middle of the straits when I read this
                    letter, and I could not think of any way of taking measures, unless I came to
                    look after it myself. But enough of this; more when we meet. I got a sight of
                    Antony's edict from Brutus, and of our friends' magnificent answer; but I don't
                    quite see the use or the object of these edicts. Nor have I come as Brutus
                    thought, to take part in the management of affairs. For what can be done? Did
                    anybody agree with Piso? Did he himself come back the next day? But, as the
                    saying goes, a man of my time of life ought not to go far from his grave. But
                    for mercy's sake what is this that I hear from Brutus! He says you told him
                    Pilia had had an attack of paralysis. I am very much disturbed about it, though
                    he tells me you say you hope she is better. I sincerely hope she is; give her
                    and darling Attica my best regards. This I have written on ship-board, as I was
                    getting near to Pompeii, Aug. 19. </p>

                    let you know. I must wait for my heavy baggage, which is coming from Anagnia,
                    and there is illness in my household. On the evening of the 1st I got a letter
                    from Octavian. (He is setting about a heavy task.) He has brought over the
                    veterans, who are at Casilinum and Calatia, to his views; and no wonder, when he
                    is giving them £20<note type="footnote" n="1" place="opposite">1 500
                        denarii.</note> apiece. He thinks of visiting the other colonies. Obviously
                    his^idea is a war with Antony under his leadership. J So I see that before long
                    we shall be in arm/ But whom are we to follow? Look at his name, and at his age.
                    And his first request of me is that I should meet him secretly at Capua or
                    somewhere near Capua. "That is quite childish, if he thinks it can be done
                    secretly. I have told him by letter that there is no necessity for it and no
                    possibility of it. /He sent me one Caecina of Volaterra, an intimate friend of
                    his, who brought this news, that Antony is making for Rome with the legion
                    Alauda, raising a forced contribution from towns, and marching with his soldiers
                    under colours. He asked my advice about setting out for Rome with 3,000 veterans
                    or holding Capua and intercepting Antony's advance, or going to the three
                    Macedonian legions, which are making or the northern Adriatic. Those he hopes
                    are on his side; they refused to take Antony's bounty, or so he says, heaped
                    insults on him and left him still haranguing. Of course, he offers himself as
                    our leader, and thinks we ought not to fail </p>

                <p> him. I advised that he should make for Rome. For it seems to me he ought to have
                    the city rabble, and, if he succeeds in inspiring them with confidence, even the
                    loyalists on his side. O Brutus, where are you? What a golden opportunity you
                    are missing! I never foresaw"this, but I thought something of the kind would
                    happen. Now, I want your advice. Shall I come to Rome, or stay here, or flee to
                    Arpinum, which would be a harbour of refuge? Rome I think, for fear I be missed,

                    January, and I really believe that is so. But he adds "with your advice." In
                    short he is pressing, while I am temporizing. I do not trust his age: I do not

                    Appian way to Rome. He would easily have caught me up, for they say he travels
                    as fast as Caesar. So from Menturnae I am turning off towards Arpinum, and I

                        was writing. Other suggestions are (a) that there is a play on the

                    Panaetius is concerned, I have finished in two books. He has three: but, though
                    at the beginning he makes a three-fold division of cases in which duty has to be
                    determined, one when the question is between right or wrong, another when it in
                    between expediency and inexpediency, and the third, how we are to decide when it
                    is a conflict between duty and expediency—for example, in Regulus' case to
                    return would be right, to stay expedient—he treated of the first two
                    brilliantly; the third he promises to add, but never wrote it. Posidonius took
                    up that topic: but I have ordered his book and written to Athenodorus Calvus to
                    send me an analysis of it, and that I am expecting. I wish you would spur him on
                    and beg him to let me have it as soon as possible. In it duties under given
                    circumstances are handled. As to your query about the title, I have no doubt
                    that καθῆκον (duty) corresponds with officium, unless you have any other
                    suggestion to make. But the fuller title is De Officiis. I am dedicating it to
                    my son. It seems to me not inappropriate. </p>

                    have not hidden myself in Pompeii, as I said I should; first because of the
                    weather, which has been abominable, and secondly because I get a letter from
                    Octavian every day, asking me to take a hand in affairs, to come to Capua, to
                    save the Republic again, and anyhow to go to Rome at once. It is a case of
                    "ashamed to shirk, but yet afraid to take." He, however, has been acting, and
                    still is acting, with great vigour. He will come to Rome with a big army; but he
                    is such a boy. He thinks he can call a Senate at once. Who will come? If anyone
                    comes, who will offend Antony in this uncertainty? Perhaps he may act as a
                    safeguard on the 1st of January, or the battle may be over before then. The
                    country towns are wonderfully enthusiastic for the boy. For, as he was making
                    his way to Samnium, he came to Cales and stopped at Teanum. There was a
                    marvellous crowd to meet him and cheers for him. Should you have thought it?

                    if Valerius the interpreter will let me know the names of the influential
                    people. For such people vary with the times, and most of my particular friends
                    are dead. However, I have written general letters, if Valerius will content
                    himself with them; otherwise he must send me names. </p>

                    9th I got up before daybreak to go on from Sinuessa, and before dawn I had
                    reached the Tirenian bridge at Menturnae, where the road for Arpinum branches
                    off, when I met a messenger, who found me " on a far journey bent." I at once
                    enquired: " Pray, is there anything from Atticus?" I could not read as yet, for
                    I had dismissed the link-bearers and it was not yet light enough. But, when it
                    got light, I began to read the first of your two letters, having already written
                    one to you. Your note was a model of elegance. Upon my life I am not saying more
                    than I mean. I never read a kinder. So I will come, when you call me, provided
                    you will assist me. But at first sight I thought nothing could be more mal ὰ

                    Then there is your other letter, in which you advise me to go " by windy Mimas

                    advise me to move slowly, and I agree, though once I thought differently. I am
                    not influenced by Philippus or Marcellus; for their position is different, or,

                    agents into the case in order to call upon the sureties, for the agents will not
                    dispute the suit, though, if they do, I know of course the sureties will escape.
                    But I think it will be a disgrace for him, if his agents do not pay up a debt
                    for which he gave security, and my position demands that I should prosecute my
                    case without extreme humiliation to him. Please write and tell me what you think
                    best; I have no doubt you will carry it through with reasonable moderation. I
                    return to public affairs. You have often said many a wise thing about politics,
                    but never anything wiser than this letter: " For though the youth is strong and

                    salvation with a saviour like that! But, as you say, I see Casca's tribuneship
                    will afford the best criterion of his policy.<note type="footnote" n="3">3 Casca

                    could not do anything of the kind, until I had made sure that he would not only
                    not be an enemy, but would be a friend to the tyrannicides. He said that would
                    be so, and 1 replied: "Then, what is the hurry? He does not want my assistance
                    before the 1st of January, and we shall see what he intends before the middle of
                    December in Casca's case." He quite agreed with me. So that's enough of that.
                    For the rest you will have messengers every day, and I think you will have
                    something to write every day too. I am sending a copy of Lepta's letter, and
                    from it you will see that that toy captain<note type="footnote" n="1">1
                        Antony.</note> has had a fall. But you will judge for yourself when you have
                    read it. When I had already sealed this letter, I got one from you and one from
                    Sextus. Nothing could have been pleasanter or more amiable than Sextus' letter.
                    For yours was a short note, the earlier one having been very full. It is wise
                    and friendly advice you give me to stay here by preference, till we hear how
                    this disturbance is going to end. But just at this minute, my dear Atticus, it
                    is not the Republic that I am bothered about—not that any thing is or ought to
                    be dearer to me, but even Hippocrates admits it is useless to apply medicine in
                    desperate cases. So let that go hang—it is my private concerns that bother me.
                    Concerns, do I say? Nay, rather my credit; for, though I have such big balances,
                    I have not even enough money on hand yet to pay Terentia. Do I speak of
                    Terentia? You know we arranged long ago to pay Montanus' debt of £250.<note

                        Aurelius<note type="footnote" n="1">1 Agent of Montanus.</note> had to raise
                    another loan at extortionate interest. For Terentia's debt Tiro tells me you
                    said there would be money from Dolabella. I think he misunderstood you, if
                    anyone can misunderstand anybody, or rather he did not understand at all. For
                    you sent me Cocceius' answer, and so did Eros in nearly the same words. So I
                    must come even into the heart of the conflagration, for private failure is even
                    more disgraceful than public failure. So for the other matters contained in your
                    pleasant letter, I was too perturbed in mind -to answer them as usual. Combine
                    with me in extricating me from the tiresome position I am in; how it is to be
                    done I have some idea, but I cannot arrange things with certainty till I see
                    you. However, how can I be less safe in Rome than Marcellus? But that is not the

                    ATTICUS. <note n="marg">Tusculum, the same time</note> I know you are much
                    attached to our friend Atticus, and to my society you are so partial that I am
                    at sure I count myself to have few friends so attentive and affectionate. For
                    our ancestral ties, so strong and old and natural, have been strengthened by the
                    equal and reciprocal liking we have, you for me and I for you. The case of the
                    Buthrotians is not unknown to you. For I have often spoken to you about it and
                    explained the whole affair to you. This is what has happened. When first we saw
                    that the lands of Buthrotum had been confiscated, Atticus was troubled and
                    composed a petition. That he gave to me to hand to Caesar, for I was going to
                    dine with him that day. That petition I handed to Caesar. He approved of the
                    case and wrote back to Atticus that his request was reasonable, but he warned
                    him that the Buthrotians must pay the rest of the money at the proper time.
                    Atticus, who wanted to save the city, paid the money on his own account. When
                    that was done we approached Caesar, said a word for the Buthrotians, and
                    obtained a most generous decree, which was signed by persons of importance.
                    After that I was much astonished that Caesar used to let those who had coveted
                    the land of the Buthrotians hold meetings, and not only allowed them to do so,
                    but even put you at the head of the commission. So I spoke to him about it, and
                    that indeed so often that he even reproached me for having so little faith in
                    his consistency; and he told Messalla and Atticus himself not to worry about it,
                    and admitted candidly </p>

                <pb n="431"/>
                <p> that he did not want to offend the people, while they were in Rome—for, as you
                    know, he aimed at popularity—but when they were across the sea, he would see to
                    it that they were transferred to some other land. That was what happened in
                    Caesar's lifetime. But, after Caesar's death, as soon as the consuls in
                    accordance with a decree of the Senate began to investigate cases, the facts as
                    I have stated them were put before them. They approved of the case without any
                    hesitation, and said they would send you letters. Now, my dear Plancus, though I
                    have no doubt that a decree of the Senate, a statute, a decree of the consuls,
                    and their despatch, will have the greatest weight with you, and I understand
                    that you will wish to please Atticus himself, yet I have taken it upon myself in
                    view of our connection and affection, to ask you for what your own exceptional
                    amiability and your goodness of heart would win from you themselves. That is,
                    that you should for my sake do this thing, which I am sure you will do of your
                    own accord, freely, fully, and quickly. I have no greater and no dearer friend
                    than Atticus. At first it was only a question of his money, and a good sum of it
                    too; but now it concerns his credit too, that he should obtain with your
                    assistance what he won by his great persistency and his popularity both in
                    Caesar's lifetime and after his death. If he obtains it from you, I hope you
                    will consider that I shall interpret your liberality as a great favour bestowed
                    upon myself. For my part, I will show-care and diligence in anything that I
                    think you desire or that concerns you. Take care of your health. </p>

                    ATTICUS. <note n="marg">Written shortly after 16a</note> I have already written
                    to ask you to render assistance in the matter of the Buthrotians, since the
                    consuls, who had the authority of a statute and a senatorial decree to
                    investigate, determine, and decide on Caesar's proceedings, have approved of
                    their case; and to relieve Atticus, whom I know you admire, and myself, who am
                    as much concerned as he is, from trouble. For now that we have brought the whole
                    business to an end with the expenditure of much care, much labour, and pains, it
                    rests with you to allow us to make an end to our anxiety as early as possible.
                    However, I am sure that you have wisdom enough to see, that, if the decisions
                    delivered by the consuls about Caesar's proceedings are not observed, things
                    will be thrown into great confusion. For my part, though one cannot approve of
                    many of Caesar's arrangements—as was natural in the case of a person so
                    busy—still I am wont to uphold them staunchly for the sake of peace and
                    quietness: and I am strongly of the opinion that you should do the same, though
                    1 am not writing as an adviser but as a suppliant. So, my dear Plancus, I beg
                    and beseech you —and I do assure you I could not be more anxious or more in
                    earnest about anything—to take in hand, to conduct, and to carry through all
                    this business in such a way, that, what we have obtained from the consuls
                    without any hesitation solely on the justice and equity of our case, we may
                    obtain from you not only with your kind indulgence but with alacrity on your
                    part. How kindly disposed you are to Atticus you have often shown him and me,
                    too, when we </p>

                <p> have been together. If you will do this, you will have bound me—who have always
                    been attached to you by my own inclination and by our family friendship- to you
                    under a heavy obligation, and I beg you earnestly and repeatedly to do so.

                        n="marg">Written at the same time as 16b</note> I never thought I should
                    have to come before yon as a suppliant, but upon my soul I am not sorry that I
                    should have an occasion for testing your affection. You know how fond I am of
                    Atticus. Pray grant me one other favour and forget for my sake that once he
                    wished to support a friend of his, who was an enemy of yours, when his
                    reputation was at stake. In the first place your kindly disposition should bid
                    you forgive that, for everyone ought to look after his own friends; in the next
                    place, leaving Atticus out of the question, if you love me—and you are always
                    declaring how great is the respect you have for your friend Cicero—grant me that
                    now I may know for a certainty what I have always believed, that you have a
                    great affection for me. By a decree, which I and many important persons signed,
                    Caesar set free the Buthrotians, and assured us that, when the
                    land-commissioners had crossed the sea, he would send a despatch about the
                    territory to which they should be transferred; and then it happened that he died
                    suddenly. Then, as you know (for you were present), when the consuls ought to
                    have decided on Caesar's proceedings in accordance with a senatorial decree,
                    they postponed the matter till the 1st of June. On the 2nd of June a law was
                    passed in </p>

                <pb n="437"/>
                <p> addition to the decree of the Senate, granting the consuls the right of deciding
                    on Caesar's statutes, decrees, and proceedings. The case of the Buthrotians was
                    put before the consuls. Caesar's decree was read to them, and many other papers
                    of Caesar's were brought forward too. By the advice of their council the consuls
                    decided in favour of the Buthrotians, and sent a despatch to Plancus. Now,
                    Capito, I know the influence you always have over those with whom you are,
                    especially with so amiable and good-natured a person as Plancus; please use all
                    your energy, or rather all your powers of persuasion, and make Plancus, who I
                    hope will be sufficiently kindly himself, still more kindly. In any case I think
                    this is the state of affairs: that without favouring anybody, Plancus will have
                    sense and wisdom enough to have no hesitation in obeying the decree of the
                    consuls, who had the right of enquiry and decision conferred upon them by law
                    and by a senatorial <!-- bad scan. probably means "decree"? -->ecree, especially
                    as, if this kind of decision is

                    may well be called in question; and not only those who benefit by them, but even
                    those who disapprove of them, have to give them their support for the sake of
                    peace. Though that is the case, still it is to our interest that Plancus should
                    do this willingly and freely; and no doubt he will if you exert your influence,
                    which I know so well, and your persuasive power, which is unequalled: and that I

                    very fully to you about the Buthrotians. I do assure you, my clear Plancus, that
                    I do not do so because I have little faith in your generosity or your friendship
                    for me. But my friend Atticus has so great a monetary stake in the matter; and
                    now, what is more, his very reputation is involved in showing that he can obtain
                    what Caesar approved of, and we, who were present when Caesar made his decrees
                    and gave his answer, witnessed and sealed. And I appeal to you especially,
                    because it is a case where the whole power, 1 will not say of confirming, but of

                    me the petition I made in my former letter, still I shall not cease from asking
                    until I have news that you have done what I am looking forward to with great
                    hope. Then I trust I shall write a different kind of letter, and pay my thanks
                    for your exceeding kindness. If that comes to pass I would have you think that
                    you have not so much put Atticus, in spite of the huge sum of money he has at
                    stake, under an obligation, as myself, who take an equal interest in the matter.

                    stake. 1 know the willingness with which you help your friends and your friends
                    help you. You can render us much assistance with Plancus. I know the kindness of
                    your heart; I know how welcome you are to your friends. There is no one who can
                    help us more than you in this case. And the case is as sound as a case ought to
                    be which the consuls have decided on the advice of their council, when they had
                    the right of decision conferred on them by statute and by senatorial decree.
                    Still to us the whole case seems to lie in the generosity of your </p>

                <pb n="443"/>
                <p> friend Plancus; and, indeed, we think he will ratify the consuls' decree both
                    for duty's sake and for the sake of the constitution, and that he will do so
                    willingly for our sake. So please help us, my dear Capito. I entreat and beseech
                    you earnestly to do so. </p>
