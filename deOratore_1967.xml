                PREFACE
                THOUGH his name does not appear on the title-page, any merit discoverable in the translation of De Oratore, Book I is largely due to my friend Mr. Charles Stuttaford, sometime of Amersham Hall School. Originally entrusted with the execution of both these volumes, he had done much preliminary work on the text and translation of Book I, when reasons of health compelled him to relinquish his task. I most gratefully acknowledge my heavy indebtedness to his labours.

                THE late Mr. E. W. Sutton left at his death only the ms. and proof of his translation of De Oratore, Book I, and three-quarters of Book II, at various stages of correction. I have completed the volume.
                An index will be found in Volume Two, which contains De Oratore, Book III, De Fato, Paradoxa Stoicorum, and De Partitione Oratoria.

                    INTRODUCTION
                    DATE AND PURPOSE OF THE WORK
                    THE circumstances in which Cicero wrote his essay On the Orator and the object that he had in view can be inferred from the following three passages in his letters:
                    Ad Atticum iv. 13. 2 (November 55 B.C). De libris oratoriis factum est a me diligenter: diu multumque in manibus fuerunt.
                    Ad Fam. i. 9. 23 (September 54 B.C). Scripsi etiam— nam ab orationibus diiungo me referoque ad mansuetiores Musas, quae me nunc maxime sicut iam a prima adulescentia delectarunt—scripsi igitur Aristotelio more, quemadmodum quidem volui, tres libros in disputatione ac dialogo de oratore, quos arbitror Lentulo tuo non fore inutiles; abhorrent enim a communibus praeceptis atque omnium antiquorum, et Aristoteliam et Isocratiam, rationem oratoriam complectuntur.
                    Ad Atticum xiii. 19. 4 (45 B.C.). Sunt etiam de oratore nostri tres (libri), mihi vehementer probati. In eis quoque eae personae sunt ut mihi tacendum fuerit, Crassus enim loquitur, Antonius, Catulus senex, C. Iulius frater Catuli, Cotta, Sulpicius. Puero me hic sermo inducitur, ut nullae esse possent partes meae. Quae autem his temporibus [i.e. 45 B.C] scripsi Aristotelium morem habent, in quo sermo ita inducitur ceterorum ut penes ipsum sit principatus.
                    We thus learn that Cicero finished the book in the book in the early winter of 55 B.C., when he had been working on
                </p>
                
                <pb n="x"/>
                <p>
                    
                    it for some time; and we infer that he published it soon afterwards, since in the following September he promises to send a copy to his friend Lentulus for the use of his son. He remarks to Lentulus that he has now almost entirely given up composing speeches, and has returned to his youthful love, the humane letters.
                    He had indeed for some time lived entirely withdrawn from public life, where even previously he had lost all power of influencing the course of affairs. In 63 B.C the oligarchical party had been glad to make use of his legal and oratorical talents in the suppression of the conspiracy of Catiline; but they were not willing to make any sacrifices in order to repay him for his services, and in 58 B.C they allowed Clodius to procure his banishment in punishment for the alleged illegality of his procedure in the Catilinarian affair. A year later Pompeius, finding Clodius more dangerous, again required Cicero's assistance, and procured his recall from exile. He was warmly welcomed back by the public, but he was no longer of any political importance, although he still appeared in the law-courts, where he delivered some considerable speeches. In 55 B.C. however, when the imperium of the triumvirs was prolonged for five years, he withdrew from the courts as well as from the senate, and devoted his leisure to study, the first fruits being the present treatise.
                    Of its merits he himself took a high view; the tone in which he writes of it to Atticus (in the third extract above) is very different from the apologetic way in which ten years later he spoke about his philosophical works: these he referred to as ἀπόγραφα, mere transcripts from Greek originals, that cost him
                </p>
                
                <pb n="xi"/>
                <p>
                    
                    little labour. The present work is indeed worthy of the greatest of Roman orators, who regards oratory as of supreme practical importance in the guidance of affairs, and who resolves, while his mind is still vigorous and powerful, to devote his enforced leisure to placing on record the fruits of his experience, for the instruction of future statesmen. The treatise is composed in the form of a conversation, though its method is very different from that of the dialogues of Plato. In those the conversational form is employed to convey the feeling of corporate research into complicated abstract questions, progressing towards the truth but not attaining it with sufficient certainty and completeness to justify its being expounded dogmatically; the positive results, so far as any can be elicited, are merely tentative. In Cicero's dialogues on the contrary the facts in respect to the matter under consideration are regarded as already ascertained; doctrines are expounded as dogmatic truths, the dialogue form being adopted as a vivid method of exhibiting the many-sided nature of the subject and the departments into which a systematic treatment of it falls. If differing opinions about it are introduced, the parts of them that are valid are accepted and put together in a single system.
                    In the second of the passages quoted above Cicero describes the work as written ' in the Aristotelian manner.' Its manner is extremely unlike that of the works of Aristotle that have come down to us, which are rigidly scientific expositions, in places hardly more than outlines and enumerations of arguments, and which have been conjectured to be the Master's actual notes for his lectures. We know

                <pb n="xii"/>
                <p>
                    
                    however that Aristotle also wrote dialogues, in which he published his doctrines in a more popular form, but all of them have now been lost.<note type="footnote" n="a">a The recently recovered Athenian Constitution does not fall exactly into either class; it is not a dialogue, but a straightforward exposition in a fully finished form.</note> It is this group of Aristotle's works the method of which, disputatio et dialogus, Cicero claims to have adopted in the present treatise, as a vehicle by which to convey the oratorical system of Aristotle himself and that of Isocrates. Some difficulty has been felt to be raised by the third passage quoted, which is ten years later in date; in it Cicero contrasts De Oratore with his later philosophical dialogues, on the ground that in the former he is not himself one of the party, the scene being laid in the time of his boyhood, whereas in the latter he follows the Aristotelian plan of assigning the principal part in the discussion to himself (a feature in Aristotle's dialogues of which we have no other evidence, but which we must accept on Cicero's authority). But in point of fact there is no discrepancy. The comparison with Aristotle in the latter passage relates to the assignment of the parts: that in the former refers to the dialogue form. Also it must be noticed that in the former passage Cicero claims to have adopted the Aristotelian method ' at all events as far as I thought fit': this qualification may well hint at the difference from Aristotle consisting in the author's taking no part in the dialogue himself.
                    Scene and Date of the Dialogue

                    PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE
                    L. Licinius Crassus was born in 140 B.C., and was therefore forty-nine years old at the date when the discussion is supposed to take place, September 91 B.C He died only a few days after that date. He was a leading figure among the moderate and judicious optimates, though it is true that he gave his name to an unwise law checking the movement to strengthen Rome by extending the citizenship to the Latins. He passed through the cursus honorum, becoming consul in 95 B.C He was the most illustrious Roman orator before Cicero, and when Cicero was a boy he acted as his tutor in rhetoric. In the present dialogue he is the mouthpiece of Cicero's own opinions.
                    M. Antonius, the grandfather of the triumvir, was Crassus's senior by three years.<note type="footnote" n="a">a Cic. Brutus 161 triennio.</note> As praetor 103 B.C he put down piracy in Cilicia and was awarded a triumph. Six years later he was a vigorous censor. Four years after the supposed date of the dialogue he fell a victim to Marius, whose minions murdered him when at supper at a friend's house.
                    In colloquy with these two great orators Cicero introduces two of the most distinguished of their younger followers.
                    P. Sulpicius Rufus was now thirty-three years old. He was one of the chief hopes of the optimate party, being a moderate conservative and following Drusus in his movement for limited reform. Later however he swung over to Marius and the extremists, and when (ten years after the date of the dialogue) Sulla
                </p>
                
                <pb n="xiv"/>
                <p>
                    
                    made himself master of Rome, he with Marius was proscribed, and soon after murdered.
                    C. Aurelius Cotta, a young man of less vigorous character, of the same age as Sulpicius, attached himself in a similar manner to Antonius. He also belonged to the party of conservative reform, but unlike Sulpicius he remained a moderate and never joined the extreme reformers. Sulla therefore allowed him to return from exile in 82 B.C. and resume his career. He rose to be consul in 75 B.C., and died the next year, after achieving some minor military successes as proconsul in Gaul.
                    These four characters take part in the whole of the dialogue. Q. Mucius Q. F. Scaevola the Augur figures in Book I only. He was nearly or quite seventy years old at the time, having been consul 117 B.C He was a learned lawyer, and an adherent of the Stoic philosophy, being a member of the Hellenizing ' Scipionic circle.' In extreme old age he refused to figure as an adherent of Sulla. Cicero tells Atticus (ad Att. iv. 16. 3) that he thought it suitable to his character and interests to introduce him at the beginning of the discussion, but due to his years to spare him the τεχνολογία of the later part. He is represented as displaying great legal knowledge and experience of the world; he somewhat disparages the value of rhetoric, and questions the need of a wide literary and philosophic education for an orator.
                    Books II and III introduce two others, Q. Lutatius Catulus and his half-brother C. Julius Caesar Strabo Vopiscus. Catulus first appears in history as colleague of Marius in the consulship, 102 B.C In the next year as proconsul he failed to check the Cim-
                </p>
                
                <pb n="xv"/>
                <p>
                    
                    brians from invading Gallia Transpadana, but with Marius defeated them at Vercellae: according to Plutarch the greater part of the credit was due to Catulus. They celebrated a triumph together. Fourteen years later on Marius's return to Rome he made Catulus one of his victims: ' moriatur ' was his instruction. Catulus was an officer and gentleman of spotless integrity; he also had considerable literary gifts.
                    Vopiscus early won a position at the bar, and was aedile in the year after the date of the dialogue. He too fell a victim to Marius.
                    
                    OUTLINE OF CONTENTS
                    Book I (§§ 1–23) Introduction: (§§ 1–5) Cicero substitutes this essay for his earlier writings on rhetoric, in order to satisfy his brother Quintus's desire for a discussion of the functions of the orator, and to justify his own view that the orator requires a wide liberal education. (§§ 6–15) Great orators are rare, not owing to dearth of ability, but because of the difficulty of the art, and in spite of its attractions. (§§ 16–23) It calls for wide knowledge, command of language, psychological insight, wit and humour, a good delivery and a good memory—even if we only aim at the eloquence requisite for public life, and consider it not theoretically but in the light of practical experience.
                    (§§ 24–29) Scene of the dialogue. The treatise gives an account of a discussion held, in September 91 B.C. At the Tusculan villa of Antonius between him and Crassus a minor share being taken by Scaevola, Sulpicius and Cotta. The discussion was as follows:

                <pb n="xvi"/>
                <p>
                    
                    (§§ 30-95) Oratory, its nature and range.
                    (§§ 30-34) Crassus praises oratory as of primary importance to society and the state: the orator's position is eminent, gratifying and powerful for good; he excels in the very gift wherein man is superior to animals, ' discourse of reason.'
                    (§§ 35-44) Scaevola objects that Crassus overrates the political influence of orators and exaggerates the range of their powers: they are often incapable of dealing with questions of law, philosophy and science. Their proper sphere is the law-courts and political debates.
                    (§§ 45-57) Crassus replies that this is indeed the Greek view, but it puts the function of oratory too low. Yet even if thus limited to politics it calls for wide knowledge, and on the other hand men of science and philosophers borrow style from oratory, although style is not as essential for them as a command of matter is essential for the orator, especially in order to control the emotions of the audience. (§§ 58-68) Eloquence does not itself bestow political knowledge, but the orator must be well versed in political and also moral science. (§§ 69-73) In power of expression and range of subject he compares with the poet; and his style will reveal whether he has had a wide education.
                    (§§ 74-79) Scaevola repeats that such a range of knowledge is beyond the reach of most orators. Crassus disclaims it himself, but maintains it as the ideal.
                    (§§ 80-95) Antonius thinks that so much knowledge is unattainable in a practical career, and also likely to form a style too abstract to be useful. He reports a debate at Athens between a Stoic, Menedemus,

                <pb n="xvii"/>

                    who disparaged rhetoric altogether, and an Academic, Charmadas, who held that it should be based on philosophy, giving examples; Charmadas denied any science of rhetoric, saying that oratory depends merely on natural aptitude and practice, and has to go to philosophy for matter. Antonius says that he has never heard real eloquence, though it may be a possibility.
                    (§§ 96-112) Crassus is urged to expound his views more fully, and with reluctance consents to do so. (§§ 102-109) He asks, is there an art<note type="footnote" n="a">a It must be remembered that ars means a systematic; treatment of a subject and conveys the sense that we attach rather to the word ' science.' Cf. Book II, § 30.</note> of rhetoric? This is a question rather for a Greek. But when pressed he says that there is none, in the strict sense, although if one reduces the results of observation and experience to a system one may produce a sort of art. He is urged to give the results of his own experience.
                    (§§ 113-262) The requirements of the orator.
                    (§§ 113-128) Natural gifts are essential for high success, although the ideal is hard to attain. Antonius agrees: orators are more exposed to criticism than even actors. (§§ 129-136) Crassus concurs, as every defect is noticed at once. He praises the natural gifts of Sulpicius and the zeal of Cotta; they only need training, so he will describe his own method.
                    (§§ 137-147) He began by taking the school course in rhetoric, treating (1) the purpose of oratory, (2) the classification of subjects, (3) the determination of the point at issue, (4) the three kinds of oratory, forensic, deliberative and panegyric; (5) its five divisions, invention, arrangement, style, memory

                <pb n="xviii"/>
                <p>
                    
                    and delivery; (6) the division of a speech into the proper parts; (7) rules of diction. Such a system though useful has not in fact been the guide of the ablest orators. Practice is all-important; it includes (§§ 148-159) speaking on cases taken from real life, occasionally impromptu; writing compositions, for training both in style and in matter; making paraphrases of poetry, especially Greek poetry, and prose, from memory; training voice and gesture; memoria technica; speaking in public; critical reading of literature; debating pro and contra; study of history, law and politics; collecting notes. Wide knowledge is essential. The true orator possesses dignity and force (160-204).
                    (§§ 205-209) Sulpicius asks for further detail, and Antonius consents to give his own views. (§§ 209-218) He challenges Crassus's definition: an orator must be able to speak agreeably and convincingly on public questions, but does not require wide general culture: that is a matter belonging to some other art. (§§ 219-233) In order to work on the emotions he needs shrewdness, experience and knowledge of the world, but not philosophy—some effective lines of pleading might be disapproved of by philosophers. (§§ 234-239) Wide knowledge of law is also unnecessary: it is eloquence that wins cases, and on hard points of law even the experts disagree. (§§ 240-250) Nor is law an easy or attractive study. A general acquaintance with its principles is all that a busy man can or need attain; details should be got up for the occasion. (§§ 251-262) Similarly voice-control, history, antiquities must be studied to some extent, but not so far as to encroach on the time needed for practice in speaking —practice is the important thing,
                </p>
                
                <pb n="xix"/>
                <p>
                    
                    (§§ 263-265) Crassus hints that Antonius has only been displaying his skill in refutation, and requests him to set out his own view of the matter in the next day's debate.
                    Book II (§§ 1-11) Introduction: Crassus and Antonius were not unlearned, as is usually supposed; such eloquence as theirs must have been based on wide study. The dialogue following will constitute a treatise on rhetoric based on more practical experience than that possessed by previous authors.
                    (§§ 12-27) The second day's debate. Catulus and Caesar arrive, and after some conversation about the employment of leisure, Antonius begins to state his,own case. (§§ 28-38) He says that oratory cannot be made into a science, but some rules for speakers can be derived from observation and experience; oratory covers all good speaking and all subjects. (§§ 39-73) He proceeds to consider the proper sphere of rhetoric. Demonstration needs no special rules; nor does
                    history he gives a survey of the chief Greek historians. The rhetoricians formulate no rules for writing history, nor for the other forms of literature that require eloquence. The same is true of the discussion of abstract subjects, for which no rules of style are needed. Any student who has mastered the more difficult problems will need no directions as to the easier ones. Forensic oratory is really the most difficult kind of oratory. (§§ 74-89) Catulus tells a story illustrating the uselessness of theory without practical experience. Antonius criticizes some superfluous or misleading rules of rhetoric. The first requisite is natural endowment, as the instance of Sulpicius shows. (§§ 90-98) There must be constant practice, largely in writing,
                </p>
                
                <pb n="xx"/>
                <p>
                    
                    a good model being chosen to copy—the Greek schools of oratory are enumerated. But men of originality can dispense with a model. (§§ 99-113) To master first of all the facts of the case will at once make clear the point at issue, which will be either one of fact or of nature or of definition. (§§ 114-151) The facts are established by evidence or by argument. The handling of these methods needs practice. Antonius offers to treat of the invention of arguments, but on request consents to deal with the method of stating them. The case should be considered under some general proposition (locus); it is a mistake to labour the distinction between general propositions and particular instances, since the vast majority of cases can all be brought under a few general heads. The sources of arguments for dealing with these should be familiar by nature, theory and particularly study.
                    (§§ 152-161) Catulus says that this agrees largely with Aristotle. He develops the Roman attitude to philosophy. Antonius holds that the Stoic system is of no use to the orator, but he praises the acuteness of Aristotle and the dialectic of Carneades.
                    (§§ 162-177) The doctrine of 'topics '—but for this purpose attention and natural acumen, together with care for variety, will nearly suffice. (§§ 178-184) 11 It is important to win the favour of the audience; modes of doing this. (§§ 185-216) It is also important to inspire them with suitable emotions; these the speaker must himself feel—instances from Antonius's own career. But in some cases to excite emotion is a mistake; and when done it must be done in the proper manner, and without exaggeration or hurry, and interspersed with conciliatory passages. Argu-
                </p>
                
                <pb n="xxi"/>
                <p>
                    
                    ments must be met by argument, and appeals to emotion by exciting the opposite emotion.
                    (§§ 217-234) Caesar discusses wit. It is of two kinds; it cannot be taught; its effectiveness illustrated from speeches of Crassus; rules for its criticism. (§§ 235-247) The laughable—its nature; its origin the unseemly, treated in a neat style; where applicable and where not; (a) wit of form and (b) wit of matter—illustrations of the latter. (§§ 248263) (a) Seven kinds of verbal wit, defined and illustrated. (§§ 264-290) (b) Nine kinds of wit of thought, subdivided and illustrated. (§§ 291-332) Antonius resumes from § 216, and discusses his own and his opponent's case. Arrangement: put your strongest argument at the beginning or at the end. Rules for the various parts of a speech. (§§ 333-340) Speeches of advice derive effect from the character of the speaker and his political experience; errors to avoid. (§§ 341-349) Panegyric, Greek masters of; praise should be given to the subject's character as displayed in his attitude towards circumstances; compare him with illustrious examples.
                    (§§ 350-367) Antonius sketches a memoria technica, originating from observations made by Simonides.
                    The debate is adjourned to the afternoon.
                    Book III (§§ 1-10) Death of Crassus soon after he had delivered an important speech. Fate of the other characters in this dialogue.
                    (§§ 17-24) The discussion resumed: Crassus begins his exposition of style. Style is not really separable from matter. (§§ 25-37) Our senses differ, but each gives pleasure; and the same is the case with works of art. Similarly various styles of oratory are all admirable.

                    (§§ 38-52) The first requisite is pure and clear diction. (§§ 53-96) Ornate style, its true conception and proper compass. (§§ 56-73) The relation of eloquence to philosophy, especially in the post-Socratic schools. (§§ 97-148) Embellishment should be produced by continuous grace, avoiding extravagance, studying light and shade, and based on general culture. (§§ 149-208) Detailed theory of the ornate style: choice of words; their combination, in point of order and rhythm; figures of speech.
                    (§§ 208-227) Oratory must be adapted to the occasion. Delivery (actio), including gesture and voice.
                    Conclusion: Hortensius complimented.
                    EDITIONS
                    De Oratore was first printed at Subiaco about 1465, (in fact it was the very first book printed in Italy) and three other Italian editions followed in fifteen years.
                    All subsequent editions have been supplanted by that of A. S. Wilkins, Oxford, 1892, the earliest containing a commentary in English. Its introduction is a mine of information on the text and contents of the book and the earlier history of rhetoric in Greece and Rome.
                    TEXT
                    The present edition has been printed from the text of V. Bétolaud, Paris, no date. A few corrections have been introduced from the text and notes of Wilkins, and a few variants are noted at the foot of the page.
                    For an exhaustive account of the MSS. the student

                <pb n="xxiii"/>
                <p>
                    
                    can refer to Wilkins. It may be noted here that the accepted text is based on two primary MSS. of the ninth century and one of the tenth, which clearly come from a single not very much older copy. Though full of obvious errors in copying, they are free from deliberate corrections; all three however are mutilated, and they leave considerable gaps in the text unattested. The same is the case with a more numerous second set, of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, which are manifestly based on one or other of the above or on their common source. A third set, all of a later date, give a complete text; but they do not show the same amount of agreement as the two earlier groups, and also their value is even more reduced by the probability that they have been largely corrupted by conjectural emendation.

Cogitanti mihi saepenumero, et memoria vetera repetenti, perbeati fuisse, Quinte frater, illi videri solent, qui in optima republica, cum et honoribus, et rerum gestarum gloria florerent, eum vitae cursum tenere potuerunt, ut vel in negotio sine periculo, vel in otio cum dignitate esse possent. Ac fuit quidem, cum mihi quoque initium requiescendi, atque animum ad utriusque nostrum praeclara studia referenda fore iustum et prope ab omnibus concessum arbitrarer, si infinitus forensium rerum labor, et ambitionis occupatio, decursu honorum,

    Nam qui locus quietis et tranquillitate plenis-simus fore videbatur, in eo maximae moles molestiarum, et turbulentissimae tempestates exstiterunt. Neque vero nobis cupientibus atque exoptantibus fructus otii datus est ad eas artes, quibus a pueris dediti fuimus, celebrandas, inter nosque recolendas. <note type="margin" n="3">3</note> Nam prima aetate incidimus in ipsam perturbationem disciplinae veteris; et consulatu devenimus in medium rerum omnium certamen atque discrimen; et hoc tempus omne post consulatum obiecimus eis fluctibus, qui, per nos a communi peste depulsi, in nosmet ipsos redundarunt. Sed tamen in his vel asperitatibus rerum, vel angustiis temporis, obsequar studiis nostris; et, quantum mihi vel fraus inimicorum, vel causae amicorum, vel respublica tribuet otii, ad scribendum potissimum conferam. <note type="margin" n="4">4</note> Tibi vero, frater, neque hortanti deero, neque roganti, nam neque auctoritate quisquam apud me plus valere te potest, neque voluntate.

Ac, ne quis forte cum aliis studiis, quae reconditis in artibus, atque in quadam varietate litterarum versentur, magis hanc dicendi rationem, quam cum imperatoris laude, aut cum boni senatoris prudentia comparandam putet, convertat animum ad ea ipsa artium genera, circum-spiciatque, qui in eis floruerint, quamque multi: sic facillime, quanta oratorum sit semperque fuerit paucitas, iudicabit.
    <note type="margin" n="9">9</note><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>III. Neque enim te fugit, artium omnium laudatarum procreatricem quamdam, et quasi parentem eam, quam φιλοσοφίαν Graeci vocant, ab hominibus doctissimis iudicari; in qua difficile est enumerare, quot viri, quanta scientia, quantaque in suis studiis varietate et copia fuerint, qui non una aliqua in re separatim elaborarint, sed omnia, quaecumque possent, vel scientiae pervestigatione, vel disserendi ratione, comprehenderint. <note type="margin" n="10">10</note> Quis ignorat, ei, qui mathematici vocantur, quanta in obscuritate rerum, et quam recondita in arte, et multiplici subtilique versentur? quo tamen in genere ita multi perfecti homines exstiterunt, ut nemo fere studuisse ei scientiae vehementius videatur, quin, quod voluerit, consecutus sit.

Ac ne illud quidem vere dici potest, aut plures ceteris artibus inservire, aut maiore delectatione, aut spe uberiore, aut praemiis ad perdiscendum amplioribus commoveri. Atque ut omittam Graeciam, quae semper eloquentiae princeps esse voluit, atque illas omnium doctrinarum inventrices Athenas, in quibus summa dicendi vis et inventa est et perfecta; in hac ipsa civitate profecto nulla unquam vehementius, quam eloquentiae studia viguerunt.

    studio omni enitendum putavit. Ac primo quidem totius rationis ignari, qui neque exercitationis ullam viam, neque aliquod praeceptum artis esse arbitrarentur, tantum, quantum ingenio et cogitatione poterant, consequebantur. Post autem, auditis oratoribus Graecis, cognitisque eorum litteris, adhibitisque doctoribus, incredibili quodam nostri homines dicendi studio flagraverunt. <note type="margin" n="15">15</note> Excitabat eos magnitudo et varietas, multitudoque in omni genere causarum, ut ad eam doctrinam, quam suo quisque studio assecutus esset, adiungeretur usus frequens, qui omnium magistrorum praecepta superaret. Erant autem huic studio maxima, quae nunc quoque sunt, exposita praemia, vel ad gratiam, vel ad opes, vel ad dignitatem. Ingenia vero (ut multis rebus possumus iudicare) nostrorum hominum multum ceteris hominibus omnium gentium praestiterunt. <note type="margin" n="16">16</note> Quibus de causis, quis non iure miretur, ex omni memoria aetatum, temporum, civitatum, tam exiguum oratorum numerum inveniri?

Quo etiam gravius iudicium in dicendo subimus. Quoties enim dicimus, toties de nobis iudicatur: et, qui semel in gestu peccavit, non continuo existimatur nescire gestum; cuius autem in dicendo aliquid reprchensum est, aut aeterna in eo, aut certe diuturna valet opinio tarditatis.

Illud vero, quod a te dictum est, esse permulta, quae orator nisi a natura haberet, non multum a magistro adiuvaretur: valde tibi assentior, inque eo vel maxime probavi summum illum doctorem, Alabandensem Apollonium, qui, cum mercede doceret, tamen non patiebatur, eos, quos iudicabat non posse oratores evadere, operam apud sese perdere, dimittebatque; et ad quam quemque artem putabat esse aptum, ad eam impellere atque hortari solebat. <note type="margin" n="127">127</note> Satis est enim ceteris artificiis percipiendis, tantummodo similem esse hominis; et id, quod tradatur, vel etiam inculcetur, si quis forte sit tardior, posse percipere animo, et memoria custodire.

poetarum, memoria iurisconsultorum, vox tragoedorum, gestus paene summorum actorum est requirendus. Quam ob rem nihil in hominum genere rarius perfecto oratore inveniri potest. Quae enim singularum rerum artifices singula si mediocriter adepti sunt, probantur, ea, nisi omnia summa sunt in oratore, probari non possunt.
    <note type="margin" n="129">129</note> Tum Crassus: Atqui vide, inquit, in artificio perquam tenui et levi, quanto plus adhibeatur diligentiae, quam in hac re, quam constat esse maximam. Saepe enim soleo audire Roscium, cum ita dicat, se adhuc reperire discipulum, quem quidem probaret, potuisse neminem: non quo non essent quidam probabiles, sed quia, si aliquid modo esset vitii, id ferre ipse non posset. Nihil est enim tam insigne, nec tam ad diuturnitatem memoriae stabile, quam id, in quo aliquid offenderis. <note type="margin" n="130">130</note> Itaque ut ad hanc similitudinem huius histrionis oratoriam laudem dirigamus, videtisne, quam nihil ab eo, nisi perfecte, nihil nisi cum summa venustate fiat, nihil nisi ita, ut deceat, et uti omnes moveat atque delectet? Itaque hoc iamdiu est consecutus, ut, in quo quisque artificio excelleret, is in suo genere Roscius diceretur. Hanc ego absolutionem perfectionemque in oratore desiderans, a qua ipse longe absum, facio impudenter: mihi enim volo ignosci, ceteris ipse non ignosco.

Nam quis ad ista summa atque in omni genere perfecta, potest pervenire? Tum ille: Ego vero, inquit, quod in vobis egregiam quamdam ac praeclaram indolem ad dicendum esse cognovi, idcirco haec exposui omnia; nec magis ad eos deterrendos, qui non possent, quam ad vos, qui possetis, exacuendos accommodavi orationem meam; et quanquam in utroque vestrum summum esse ingenium studiumque perspexi, tamen haec, quae sunt in specie posita, de quibus plura fortasse dixi, quam solent Graeci dicere, in te, Sulpici, divina sunt. <note type="margin" n="132">132</note> Ego enim neminem, nec motu corporis, neque ipso habitu atque forma aptiorem, nec voce pleniorem, aut suaviorem mihi videor audisse; quae quibus a natura minora data sunt, tamen illud assequi possunt, ut eis, quae habeant, modice et scienter utantur, et ut ne dedeceat. Id enim est maxime vitandum, et de hoc uno minime est facile praecipere, non mihi modo, qui sicut unus paterfamilias his de rebus loquor, sed etiam ipsi illi Roscio; quem saepe audio dicere, caput esse artis, decere: quod tamen unum id esse, quod tradi arte non possit. <note type="margin" n="133">133</note> Sed, si placet, sermonem alio trans-</p>

Minime vero, inquit Cotta: nunc enim te iam exoremus necesse est, quoniam retines nos in hoc studio, nec ad aliam dimittis artem, ut nobis explices, quidquid est istud, quod tu in dicendo potes; neque enim sumus nimis avidi: ista tua mediocri eloquentia contenti sumus, idque ex te quaerimus—ut ne plus nos assequamur, quam quantulum tu in dicendo as-secutus es—, quoniam, quae a natura expetenda sunt, ea dicis non nimis deesse nobis, quid praeterea esse assumendum putes.

Tum Crassus arridens: Quid censes, inquit, Cotta, nisi studium, et ardorem quemdam amoris? sine quo cum in vita nihil quidquam egregium, tum certe hoc, quod tu expetis, nemo unquam as-sequetur. Neque vero vos ad eam rem video esse cohortandos; quos, cum mihi quoque sitis molesti, nimis etiam flagrare intellego cupiditate. <note type="margin" n="135">135</note> Sed profecto studia nihil prosunt perveniendi aliquo, nisi illud, quod eo, quo intendas, ferat deducatque, cognoris.

Tum Crassus: Atqui arbitror, Sulpici, cum audieris, non tam te haec admiraturum, quae dixero, quam existimaturum, tum, cum ea audire cupiebas, causam cur cuperes, non fuisse. Nihil enim dicam reconditum, nihil exspectatione vestra dignum, nihil aut inauditum vobis, aut cuiquam novum.

In his enim fere rebus omnis istorum artificum doctrina versatur, quam ego si nihil dicam adiuvare, mentiar. Habet enim quaedam quasi ad commonendum oratorem, quo quidque referat, et quo intuens, ab eo, quodcumque sibi proposuerim minus aberret.
                    <note type="margin" n="146">146</note> Verum ego hanc vim intellego esse in praeceptis omnibus, non ut ea secuti oratores, eloquentiae laudem sint adepti, sed, quae sua sponte homines eloquentes facerent, ea quosdam observasse atque collegisse; sic esse non eloquentiam ex artificio, sed artificium ex eloquentia natum: quod tamen, ut ante dixi, non eiicio: est enim, etiamsi minus necessarium ad bene dicendum, tamen ad cognoscendum non illiberale. <note type="margin" n="147">147</note> Et exercitatio quaedam suscipienda vobis est: quanquam vos quidem iampridem estis in cursu; sed eis, qui ingrediuntur in stadium, quique ea, quae agenda sunt in foro, tanquam in acie, possunt etiam nunc exercitatione quasi ludicra praediscere ac meditari.</p>

<p><note type="margin" n="148">148</note>Hanc ipsam, inquit Sulpicius, nosse volumus: attamen ista, quae abs te breviter de arte decursa sunt, audire cupimus, quanquam sunt nobis quoque non inaudita. Verum illa mox: nunc, de ipsa exercitatione quid sentias, quaerimus.

Equidem probo ista, Crassus inquit, quae vos facere soletis, ut, causa aliqua posita consimili causarum earum, quae in forum deferuntur, dicatis quam maxime ad veritatem accommodate. Sed plerique in hoc vocem modo, neque eam scienter, et vires exercent suas, et linguae celeritatem incitant, verborumque frequentia delectantur. In quo fallit eos, quod audierunt, dicendo homines, ut dicant, efficere solere. <note type="margin" n="150">150</note> Vere enim etiam illud dicitur, perverse dicere, homines, perverse dicendo, facillime consequi. Quam ob rem in istis ipsis exercitationibus, etsi utile est, etiam subito saepe dicere, tamen illud utilius, sumpto spatio ad cogitandum, paratius atque accuratius dicere. Caput autem est, quod, ut vere dicam, minime facimus—est enim magni laboris, quem plerique fugimus—, quam plurimum scribere. Stilus optimus et praestantissimus dicendi effector ac magister: neque iniuria. Nam si subitam et fortuitam orationem commentatio et cogitatio facile vincit; hanc ipsam profecto assidua ac diligens scriptura superabit. <note type="margin" n="151">151</note> Omnes enim, sive artis sunt loci, sive ingenii cuiusdam atque prudentiae, qui modo insunt in ea re, de qua scribimus, anquirentibus nobis,</p>

    <note type="margin" n="152">152</note> Haec sunt, quae clamores et admirationes in bonis oratoribus efficiunt; neque ea quisquam, nisi diu multumque scriptitarit, etiamsi vehementissime se in his subitis dictionibus exercuerit, consequetur; et qui a scribendi consuetudine ad dicendum venit, hanc affert facultatem, ut, etiam subito si dicat, tamen illa, quae dicantur, similia scriptorum esse videantur; atque etiam, si quando in dicendo scriptum attulerit aliquid, cum ab eo discesserit, reliqua similis oratio consequetur. <note type="margin" n="153">153</note> Ut concitato navigio, cum remiges inhibuerunt, retinet tamen ipsa navis motum et cursum suum, intermisso impetu pulsuque remorum: sic in oratione perpetua, cum scripta deficiunt, parem tamen obtinet oratio reliqua cursum, scriptorum similitudine et vi concitata.

Sed quanquam satis eis, qui aderant, ad id, quod erat propositum, dictum videbatur, tamen sentiebant celerius esse multo, quam ipsi vellent, ab eo peroratum.

<note type="margin" n="161">161</note> Immo id mehercule, inquit, ipsum attendo. Tantus enim cursus verborum fuit, et sic evolavit oratio, ut eius vim atque incitationem aspexerim, vestigia ingressumque vix viderim; et tanquam in aliquam locupletem ac refertam domum venerim, non explicata veste, neque proposito argento, neque tabulis et signis propalam collocatis, sed his omnibus multis magnificisque rebus constructis ac reconditis: sic modo in oratione Crassi divitias atque ornamenta eius ingenii per quaedam involucra atque integumenta perspexi; sed ea cum contemplari cuperem, vix aspiciendi potestas fuit. Ita neque hoc possum dicere, me omnino ignorare, quid possideat, neque plane nosse, ac vidisse.
<note type="margin" n="162">162</note> Quin tu igitur facis idem, inquit Scaevola, quod faceres, si in aliquam domum, plenam ornamentorum, villamve venisses? Si ea seposita, ut dicis, essent, tu valde spectandi cupidus esses; non dubitares rogare dominum, ut proferri iuberet, praesertim si esses familiaris. Similiter nunc petes a Crasso, ut eam copiam ornamentorum suorum, quam constructam uno in loco, quasi per transennam praetereuntes strictim aspeximus, in lucem proferat, et suo quidque in loco collocet?
<note type="margin" n="163">163</note> Ego vero, inquit Cotta, a te peto, Scaevola—me enim, et hunc Sulpicium impedit pudor ab homine omnium gravissimo, qui genus huiusmodi disputationis semper contempserit, haec, quae isti forsitan</p>

Sed hoc tamen cecidit mihi peropportune, quod, transactis iam meis partibus, ad Antonium audiendum venistis.

Etenim cum plerique temere ac nulla ratione causas in foro dicant, nonnulli autem propter exercitationem, aut propter consuetudinem aliquam, callidius id faciant, non est dubium quin, si quis animadverterit, quid sit, quare alii melius quam alii dicant, id possit notare. <note type="margin" n="33">33</note> Ergo id qui toto in genere fecerit, is si non plane artem, at quasi artem quamdam invenerit.

Sed, quid cuiusque sit proprium, etsi ex eo iudicari potest, cum videris, quid quaeque doceat, tamen hoc certius nihil esse potest, quam quod omnes artes aliae sine eloquentia suum munus praestare possunt, orator sine ea nomen obtinere suum non potest: ut ceteri, si diserti sint, aliquid ab hoc habeant, hic nisi domesticis se instruxerit copiis, aliunde dicendi copiam petere non possit.

' Non enim possum quin exclamem,' ut ait ille in Trinummo: ita mihi vim oratoris cum exprimere subtiliter visus es, tum laudare copiosissime. Quod quidem eloquentem vel optime facere oportet, ut eloquentiam laudet; debet enim ad eam laudandam ipsam illam adhibere, quam laudat.

Tum Antonius: Heri enim, inquit, hoc mihi proposueram, ut, si te refellissem, hos a te discipulos abducerem: nunc, Catulo audiente et Caesare, videor debere non tam pugnare tecum, quam, quid ipse sentiam, dicere. <note type="margin" n="41">41</note> Sequitur igitur, quoniam nobis est hic, de quo loquimur, in foro atque in oeulis eivium constituendus, ut videamus, quid ei negotii demus, cuique eum muneri velimus esse praepositum. Nam Crassus heri, cum vos, Catule et Caesar, non adessetis, posuit breviter in artis distributione idem, quod Graeci plerique posuerunt, neque sane quid ipse sentiret, sed quid ab illis diceretur, ostendit: duo prima genera quaestionum esse, in quibus eloquentia versaretur, unum infinitum, alterum certum. <note type="margin" n="42">42</note> Infinitum mihi videbatur id dicere, in quo aliquid generatim quaereretur, hoc modo: ' Expetendane esset eloquentia, expetendine honores?

Ita, inquit Antonius, et in eo quidem genere scio et me, et omnes qui adfuerunt, delectatos esse vehementer, cum abs te est Popilia, mater vestra, laudata, cui primum mulieri hunc honorem in nostra civitate tributum puto. Sed non omnia, quaecumque loquimur, mihi videntur ad artem et ad praecepta esse revocanda. <note type="margin" n="45">45</note> Ex eis enim fontibus, unde omnia praecepta dicendi sumuntur, licebit etiam laudationem ornare, neque illa elementa desiderare, quae ut nemo tradat, quis est, qui nesciat, quae sint in homine laudanda?

Haec, et quae sunt eius generis, facile videbit, qui volet laudare; et qui vituperare, contraria.
<note type="margin" n="47">47</note> Cur igitur dubitas, inquit Catulus, facere hoc tertium genus, quoniam est in ratione rerum? Non enim, si est facilius, eo de numero quoque est excerpendum.

Quid? si quod saepe summis viris accidit mandata sint exponenda, aut in senatu ab imperatore, aut ad imperatorem, aut ad regem, aut ad populum aliquem a senatu, num quia genere orationis in eiusmodi causis accuratiore est utendum, idcirco pars etiam haec causarum numeranda videtur, aut propriis praeceptis instruenda? Minime vero, inquit Catulus: non enim deerit homini diserto in eiusmodi rebus facultas, ex ceteris rebus et causis comparata.
<note type="margin" n="50">50</note> Ergo item, inquit, illa, quae saepe diserte agenda sunt, et quae ego paulo ante cum eloquentiam laudarem dixi oratoris esse, neque habent suum locum ullum in divisione partium, neque certum praeceptorum genus, et agenda sunt non minus diserte, quam quae in lite dicuntur, obiurgatio, cohortatio, consolatio: quorum nihil est, quod non summa dicendi ornamenta desideret; sed ex artificio res istae praecepta non quaerunt.

Itaque qualis apud Graecos Pherecydes, Hellanicus, Acusilas fuit, aliique permulti, talis noster Cato, et Pictor, et Piso, qui neque tenent, quibus rebus ornetur oratio—modo enim huc ista sunt importata,—et, dum intellegatur, quid dicant, unam dicendi laudem putant esse brevitatem. <note type="margin" n="54">54</note> Paulum se erexit, et addidit historiae maiorem sonum vocis vir optimus, Crassi familiaris, Antipater: ceteri non exornatores rerum, sed tantummodo narratores fuerunt.

Nemo enim studet eloquentiae nostrorum hominum, nisi ut in causis atque in foro eluceat; apud Graecos autem eloquentissimi homines, remoti a causis forensibus, cum ad ceteras res illustres, tum ad scribendam historiam maxime se applicaverunt. Namque et Herodotum illum, qui princeps genus hoc ornavit, in causis nihil omnino versatum esse accepimus: atqui tanta est eloquentia, ut me quidem, quantum ego Graece scripta intellegere possum, magnopere delectet.
    <note type="margin" n="56">56</note> Et post illum Thucydides omnes dicendi artificio, mea sententia, facile vicit: qui ita creber est rerum frequentia, ut verborum prope numerum sententiarum numero consequatur, ita porro verbis est aptus et pressus, ut nescias, utrum res oratione, an verba sententiis illustrentur. Atqui ne hunc quidem, quanquam est in republica versatus, ex numero accepimus eorum, qui causas dictitarunt: et hos ipsos libros tum scripsisse dicitur, cum a republica remotus, atque, id quod optimo cuique Athenis accidere solitum est, in exsilium pulsus esset. <note type="margin" n="57">57</note> Hunc consecutus est Syracusius Philistus, qui, cum Dionysii tyranni familiarissimus esset, otium suum consumpsit in historia scribenda, maximeque Thucy-

Denique etiam a philosophia profectus princeps Xenophon, Socraticus ille, post ab Aristotele Callisthenes, comes Alexandri, scripsit historiam, et is quidem rhetorico paene more; ille autem superior leniore quodam sono est usus, et qui illum impetum oratoris non habeat, vehemens fortasse minus, sed aliquanto tamen est, ut mihi quidem videtur, dulcior. Minimus natu horum omnium Timaeus, quantum autem iudicare possum, longe eruditissimus, et rerum copia et sententiarum varietate abundantissimus, et ipsa compositione verborum non impolitus, magnam eloquentiam ad scribendum attulit, sed nullum usum forensem.

Denique ei, qui profitetur esse suum, non solum de eis controversiis, quae temporibus et personis notatae sunt, hoc est, de omnibus forensibus, sed etiam de generum infinitis quaestionibus dicere, nullum potest esse genus orationis, quod sit exceptum.

Vix annus intercesserat ab hoc sermone cohortationis meae, cum iste accusavit C. Norbanum, defendente me. Non est credibile, quid interesse mihi sit visum inter eum qui tum erat, et qui anno ante fuerat. Omnino in illud genus eum Crassi magnificum atque praeclarum natura ipsa ducebat: sed ea non satis proficere potuisset, nisi eodem studio atque imitatione intendisset, atque ita dicere consuesset, ut tota mente Crassum atque omni animo intueretur.

Sed in eo genere, in quo quale sit quid, ambigitur, exsistit etiam ex scripti interpretatione saepe contentio, in quo nulla potest esse nisi ex ambiguo controversia. Nam illud ipsum, quod scriptum a sententia discrepat, genus quoddam habet ambigui; quod tum explicatur, cum ea verba, quae desunt, suggesta sunt, quibus additis defenditur sententiam scripti perspicuam fuisse. Ex contrariis-que scriptis si quid ambigitur, non novum genus nascitur, sed superioris generis causa duplicatur. Idque aut numquam diiudicari poterit aut ita diiudicabitur, ut referendis praeteritis verbis id scriptum, quodcumque defendemus, suppleatur.

<note type="margin" n="113">113</note> Ita tria sunt omnino genera, quae in disceptationem et controversiam cadere possunt: quid fiat factum futurumve sit, aut quale sit, aut quo modo nominetur. Nam illud quidem, quod quidam Graeci adiungunt, 'rectene factum sit,' totum in eo est, ' quale sit.'

Atque isti quidem, qui docent, cum causas in plura genera secuerunt, singulis generibus argumentorum copiam suggerunt. Quod etiamsi ad instituendos adolescentulos magis aptum est, ut, simul ac posita causa sit, habeant quo se referant, unde statim expedita possint argumenta depromere, tamen et tardi ingenii est rivulos consectari, fontis rerum non videre, et iam aetatis est ususque nostri a capite quod velimus arcessere et unde omnia manent videre.

Video enim in Catonis et in Bruti libris nominatim fere referri quid alicui de iure viro aut mulieri responderit: credo, ut putaremus in hominibus, non in re, consultationis aut dubitationis causam aliquam fuisse; ut, quod homines innumerabiles essent, debilitati a iure cognoscendo voluntatem discendi simul cum spe perdiscendi abiceremus. Sed haec Crassus aliquando nobis expediet et exponet discripta generatim; est enim, ne forte nescias, heri nobis ille hoc, Catule, pollicitus se ius civile, quod nunc diffusum et dissipatum esset, in certa genera coacturum et ad artem facilem redacturum.

Nam hercle, inquit Antonius, si haec vere a Catulo dicta sunt, tibi mecum in eodem est pistrino, Crasse, vivendum; et istam oscitantem et dormitantem sapientiam Scaevolarum et ceterorum beatorum otio concedamus. <note type="margin" n="145">145</note> Arrisit hic Crassus leniter et: Pertexe modo, inquit, Antoni, quod exorsus es; me tamen ista oscitans sapientia, simul atque ad eam confugero, in libertatem vindicabit.

Et sic, cum ad inveniendum in dicendo tria sint: acumen, deinde ratio, quam licet, si volumus, appellemus artem, tertium diligentia, non possum equidem non ingenio primas concedere, sed tamen ipsum ingenium diligentia etiam ex tarditate incitat; <note type="margin" n="148">148</note> diligentia, inquam, quae cum omnibus in rebus tum in causis defendendis plurimum valet.

Atque ego idem existimavi pecudis esse, non hominis, cum tantas res Graeci susciperent, profiterentur, agerent seseque et videndi res obscurissimas et bene vivendi et copiose dicendi rationem daturos hominibus pollicerentur, non admovere aurem et, si palam audire eos non auderes, ne minueres apud tuos cives auctoritatem tuam, subauscultando tamen excipere voces eorum et procul quid narrarent at-tendere.

Sed tamen haec est mea sententia, quam videbar exposuisse: ego ista studia non improbo, moderata modo sint: opinionem istorum studiorum et suspicionem artificii apud eos, qui res iudicent, oratori adversariam esse arbitror, imminuit enim et oratoris auctoritatem et orationis fidem.

Tum ex libro tertio, in quo finem scribendi fecit—tot enim, ut audivi Scaevolam dicere, sunt veri Bruti libri—' In Tiburti forte as-sedimus ego et Marcus filius.'

Quare tibi, Antoni, utrumque assentior, et multum facetias in dicendo prodesse saepe, et eas arte nullo modo posse tradi. Illud quidem admiror, te nobis in eo genere tribuisse tantum, et non huius rei quoque palmam, ut ceterarum, Crasso detulisse.

Ego vero, inquit ille, quoniam collectam a conviva, Crasse, exigis, non committam, ut, si defugerim, tibi causam aliquam dem recusandi, quanquam soleo saepe mirari eorum impudentiam, qui agunt in scena gestum, spectante Roscio; quis enim sese commovere potest, cuius ille vitia non videat?

Atque illud primum, quid sit ipse risus, quo pacto concitetur, ubi sit, quomodo exsistat, atque ita repente erumpat, ut eum cupientes tenere nequeamus, et quomodo simul latera, os, venas, vultum, oculos occupet, viderit Democritus: neque enim ad hunc sermonem hoc pertinet; et, si pertineret, nescire me tamen id non puderet quod ne illi quidem scirent, qui pollicerentur.

<note type="margin" n="237">237</note> Quatenus autem sint ridicula tractanda oratori, perquam diligenter videndum est, id quod in quarto loco quaerendi posueramus. Nam nec insignis improbitas, et scelere iuncta, nec rursus miseria insignis agitata ridetur: facinorosos enim maiore quadam vi quam ridiculi vulnerari volunt; miseros illudi nolunt nisi se forte iactant.

Itaque ea facillime luduntur, quae neque odio magno, neque misericordia maxima digna sunt.

    Duo enim sunt genera facetiarum, quorum alterum re tractatur, alterum dicto. <note type="margin" n="240">240</note> Re, si quando quid, tanquam aliqua fabella narratur; ut olim tu, Crasse, in Memmium, ' comedisse eum lacertum Largi,' cum esset cum eo Tarracinae de amicula rixatus: salsa, at tamen a te ipso ficta tota narratio. Addidisti clausulam, tota Tarracina tum omnibus in parietibus inscriptas fuisse litteras, LLL, MM; cum quaereres id quid esset, senem tibi quendam oppidanum dixisse ' Lacerat Lacertum Largi Mordax Memmius.' <note type="margin" n="241">241</note> Perspicitis, hoc genus quam sit facetum, quam elegans, quam oratorium, sive habeas vere, quod narrare possis, quod tamen est mendaciunculis aspergendum, sive fingas.

Quid aliud fuit, in quo contio rideret, nisi illa vultus et vocis mutatio? ' Per tuas statuas' vero cum dixit, et extento bracchio paululum etiam de gestu addidit, vehementius risimus. Ex hoc genere est illa Rosciana imitatio senis: ' Tibi ego, Antipho, has sero,' inquit. Senium

est, cum audio. Atqui ita est totum hoc ipso genere ridiculum, ut cautissime tractandum sit. Mimorum est enim ethologorum, si nimia est imitatio, sicut obscenitas. Orator surripiat oportet imitationem ut is qui audiet, cogitet plura, quam videat; praestet idem ingenuitatem et ruborem suum, verborum turpitudine et rerum obscenitate vitanda.
    <note type="margin" n="243">243</note> <milestone unit="section" n="60"/>LX. Ergo haec duo genera sunt eius ridiculi, quod in re positum est; quae sunt propria perpetuarum facetiarum, in quibus describuntur hominum mores, et ita effinguntur, ut aut re narrata aliqua, quales sint, intellegantur, aut, imitatione brevi iniecta, in aliquo insigni ad irridendum vitio reperiantur.
    <note type="margin" n="244">244</note> In dicto autem ridiculum est id, quod verbi, aut sententiae quodam acumine movetur. Sed ut in illo superiore genere vel narrationis, vel imitationis, vitanda est mimorum ethologorum similitudo, sic in hoc scurrilis oratori dicacitas magnopere fugienda est. Qui igitur distinguemus a Crasso, a Catulo, a ceteris familiarem vestrum, Granium, aut Vargulam, amicum meum? Non mehercule in mentem mihi quidem venit: sunt enim dicaces; Granio quidem nemo dicacior. Hoc, opinor, primum, ne, quotienscumque potuerit dictum dici, necesse habeamus dicere. <note type="margin" n="245">245</note> Pusillus testis processit. ' Licet,' inquit, ' rogare? '

Philippus. Tum quaesitor properans: ' Modo breviter.' Hic ille: ' Non accusabis; perpusillum rogabo.' Ridicule. Sed sedebat iudex L. Aurifex, brevior ipse, quam testis etiam: omnis est risus in iudicem conversus: visum est totum scurrile ridiculum. Ergo haec quae cadere possunt in quos nolis, quamvis sint bella, sunt tamen ipso genere scurrilia. <note type="margin" n="246">246</note> Ut iste, qui se vult dicacem, et mehercule est, Appius, sed nonnunquam in hoc vitium scurrile delabitur. ' Cenabo,' inquit, ' apud te,' huic lusco, familiari meo, C. Sextio; ' uni enim locum esse video.' Est hoc scurrile, et quod sine causa lacessivit; et tamen id dixit quod in omnis luscos conveniret; ea, quia meditata putantur esse, minus ridentur. Illud egregium Sextii, et ex tempore: ' Manus lava,' inquit, ' et cena.'
    <note type="margin" n="247">247</note> Temporis igitur ratio, et ipsius dicacitatis moderatio et temperantia et raritas dictorum distinguet oratorem a scurra, et quod nos cum causa dicimus, non ut ridiculi videamur, sed ut proficiamus aliquid, illi totum diem et sine causa. Quid enim est Vargula assccutus, cum eum candidatus A. Sempronius cum Marco suo fratre complexus esset: ' Puer, abige muscas?

cendi prudentia et gravitate moderabimur: quarum utinam artem aliquam haberemus! sed domina natura est.
    <note type="margin" n="248">248</note> <milestone unit="section" n="61"/>LXI. Nunc exponamus genera ipsa summatim, quae risum maxime moveant. Haec igitur sit prima partitio, quod facete dicatur, id alias in re habere alias in verbo facetias: maxime autem homines delectari, si quando risus coniuncte re verboque moveatur. Sed hoc mementote, quoscumque locos attingam, unde ridicula ducantur, ex eisdem locis fere etiam graves sententias posse duci. Tantum interest, quod gravitas honestis in rebus severe, iocus in turpiculis et quasi deformibus ponitur, velut eisdem verbis et laudare frugi servum possumus, et, si est nequam, iocari. Ridiculum est illud Neronianum vetus in furaci servo, ' Solum esse, cui domi nihil sit nec obsignatum, nec occlusum ': quod idem in bono servo dici solet, sed hoc eisdem etiam verbis. <note type="margin" n="249">249</note> Ex eisdem autem locis nascuntur omnia. Nam quod Sp. Carvilio graviter claudicanti ex vulnere ob rempublicam accepto, et ob eam causam verecundanti in publicum prodire, mater dixit, ' Quin prodis, mi Spuri? quotienscumque gradum facies, totiens tibi tuarum virtutum veniet in mentem ': praeclarum et grave est. Quod Calvino Glaucia claudicanti, ' Ubi est vetus illud: num claudicat? at hic clodicat,' hoc ridiculum est; et utrumque ex eo, quod in

<p>
claudicatione animadverti potuit, est ductum. ' Quid hoc Naevio ignavius? ' severe Scipio. At in male olentem, ' Video me a te circumventi,' subridicule Philippus. At utrumque genus continet verbi ad litteram immutati similitudo.
    <note type="margin" n="250">250</note> Ex ambiguo dicta vel argutissima putantur, sed non semper in ioco, saepe etiam in gravitate versantur. Africano illi superiori, coronam sibi in convivio ad caput accommodanti, cum ea saepius rumperetur, P. Licinius Varus, ' Noli mirari,' inquit, ' si non convenit: caput enim magnum est': laudabile et honestum. At ex eodem genere est: ' Calvus satis est, quod dicit parum.' Ne multa: nullum genus est ioci, quo non ex eodem severa et gravia sumantur.
    <note type="margin" n="251">251</note> Atque hoc etiam animadvertendum est, non esse omnia ridicula faceta. Quid enim potest esse tam ridiculum, quam sannio est? Sed ore, vultu, imitandis moribus, voce, denique corpore ridetur ipso. Salsum hunc possum dicere, atque ita, non ut eiusmodi oratorem esse velim, sed ut mimum.
    <milestone unit="section" n="62"/>LXII. Quare primum genus hoc, quod risum vel maxime movet, non est nostrum: morosum, superstitiosum, suspiciosum, gloriosum, stultum; naturae ridentur ipsae: quas personas agitare solemus, non
</p>








<pb n="386"/>

<p>
    sustinere. <note type="margin" n="252">252</note> Alterum genus est in imitatione admodum ridiculum, sed nobis furtim tantum uti licet, si quando, et cursim; aliter enim minime est liberale. Tertium, oris depravatio, non digna nobis. Quartum, obscenitas, non solum non foro digna, sed vix convivio liberorum. Detractis igitur tot rebus ex hoc oratorio loco facetiae reliquae sunt, quae aut in re, ut ante divisi, positae videntur esse aut in verbo. Nam quod, quibuscumque verbis dixeris, facetum tamen est, re continetur; quod mutatis verbis salem amittit, in verbis habet leporem omnem.
<note type="margin" n="253">253</note> Ambigua sunt in primis acuta atque in verbo posita, non in re; sed non saepe magnum risum movent, magisque ut belle et litterate dicta laudantur: ut in illum Titium, qui, cum studiose pila luderet, et idem signa sacra noctu frangere putaretur, gregalesque, cum in Campum non venisset, requirerent, excusavit Vespa Terentius, quod eum ' bracchium fregisse,' diceret; ut illud Africani, quod est apud Lucilium:
Quid Decius? Nuculam an confixum vis facere? inquit.
Ut tuus amicus, Crasse, Granius, ' non esse sextantis.' <note type="margin" n="254">254</note> Et si quaeritis, is, qui appellatur dicax, hoc

<pb n="388"/>

<p>
genere maxime excellet, sed risus movent aha maiores. Ambiguum per se ipsum probatur id quidem, ut ante dixi, vel maxime; ingeniosi enim videtur vim verbi in aliud atque ceteri accipiant, posse ducere; sed admirationem magis quam risum movet, nisi si quando incidit in aliud genus ridiculi.
    <note type="margin" n="255">255</note> <milestone unit="section" n="63"/>LXIII. Quae genera percurram equidem. Sed scitis esse notissimum ridiculi genus, cum aliud exspectamus, aliud dicitur. Hic nobismet ipsis noster error risum movet. Quod si admixtum est etiam ambiguum, fit salsius: ut apud Novium videtur esse misericors ille, qui iudicatum duci videns, percontatur ita: ' quanti addictus?' ' Mille nummum.' Si addidisset tantummodo: ' Ducas licet'; esset illud genus ridiculi praeter exspectationem, sed quia addidit: ' Nihil addo, ducas licet,' addito ambiguo, altero genere ridiculi, fuit, ut mihi quidem videtur, salsissimus. Hoc tum est venustissimum, cum in altercatione arripitur ab adversario verbum, et ex eo, ut a Catulo in Philippum, in eum ipsum aliquid, qui lacessivit, infligitur. <note type="margin" n="256">256</note> Sed cum plura sint ambigui genera, de quibus est doctrina quaedam subtilior, attendere et aucupari verba oportebit: in quo, ut ea
</p>






<pb n="390"/>

<p>
quae sint frigidiora, vitemus (etenim cavendum est, ne arcessitum dictum putetur), permulta tamen acute dicemus.
Alterum genus est, quod habet parvam verbi immutationem, quod in littera positum Graeci vocant παρονμασίαν, ut ' Nobiliorem, mobiliorem ' Cato; aut, ut idem, cum cuidam dixisset: ' Eamus deambulatum ': et ille: ' Quid opus fuit de? ' Immo vero,' inquit, ' quid opus fuit te? ' aut eiusdem re-sponsio illa: ' Si tu et adversus et aversus impudicus es.' <note type="margin" n="257">257</note> Etiam interpretatio nominis habet acumen, cum ad ridiculum convertas, quam ob rem ita quis vocetur; ut ego nuper Nummium divisorem, ut Neoptolemum ad Troiam, sic illum in Campo Martio nomen invenisse. Atque haec omnia verbo continentur.
    <milestone unit="section" n="64"/>LXIV. Saepe etiam versus facete interponitur, vel ut est, vel paululum immutatus, aut aliqua pars versus, ut Statius Scauro stomachanti: ex quo sunt nonnulli, qui tuam legem de civitate natam, Crasse, dicant:
St, tacete, quid hoc clamoris? quibus nec mater, nec pater, Tanta confidentia? auferte istam enim superbiam.
Nam in Caelio sane etiam ad causam utile fuit tuum illud, Antoni, cum ille a se pecuniam profectam

<note type="margin" n="258">258</note> In hoc genus coniciuntur proverbia, ut illud Scipionis, cum Asellus omnes provincias stipendia merentem se peragrasse gloriaretur, ' Agas asellum,' et cetera. Quare ea quoque, quoniam mutatis verbis non possunt retinere eandem venustatem, non in re, sed in verbis posita ducantur.
    <note type="margin" n="259">259</note> Est etiam in verbo positum non insulsum genus ex eo, cum ad verbum, non ad sententiam rem accipere videare: ex quo uno genere totus est Tutor, mimus vetus, oppido ridiculus. Sed abeo a mimis; tantum genus huius ridiculi insigni aliqua et nota re notari volo. Est autem ex hoc genere illud, quod tu, Crasse, nuper ei, qui te rogasset, num tibi molestus esset futurus, si ad te bene ante lucem venisset: ' Tu vero,' inquisti, 'molestus non eris.' ' Iubebis igitur te,' inquit, ' suscitari? ' Et tu: ' Certe negaram te molestum futurum.' <note type="margin" n="260">260</note> Ex eodem hoc vetus illud est, quod aiunt Maluginensem illum Scipionem, cum ex centuria sua renuntiaret Acidinum consulem praecoque dixisset, ' Dic de L.

' ' Non hercule,' inquit, ' ex mei animi sententia.' Haec aut frigida sunt, aut tum salsa, cum aliud est exspectatum. Natura enim nos, ut ante dixi, noster delectat error: ex quo, cum quasi decepti sumus exspectatione, ridemus.
    <note type="margin" n="261">261</note> <milestone unit="section" n="65"/>LXV. In verbis etiam illa sunt, quae aut ex immutata oratione ducuntur, aut ex unius verbi translatione, aut ex inversione verborum. Ex immutatione, ut olim, Rusca cum legem ferret annalem, dissuasor M. Servilius: ' Dic mihi,' inquit,' M. Pinari, num, si contra te dixero, mihi male dicturus es, ut ceteris fecisti?' <note type="margin" n="262">262</note> 'Ut sementem feceris, ita metes,' inquit. Ex translatione autem, ut, cum Scipio ille maior Corinthiis statuam pollicentibus eo loco, ubi aliorum essent imperatorum, ' turmales ' dixit ' displicere.' Invertuntur autem verba, ut, Crassus apud M. Perpernam iudicem pro Aculeone cum diceret, aderat contra Aculeonem Gratidiano L. Aelius Lamia, deformis, ut nostis; qui cum interpellaret

odiose: ' Audiamus,' inquit, ' pulchellum puerum,' Crassus. Cum esset arrisum, ' Non potui mihi,' inquit Lamia,' formam ipse fingere; ingenium potui.' Tum hic, ' Audiamus,' inquit, ' disertum.' Multo etiam arrisum est vehementius.
Sunt etiam illa venusta, ut in gravibus sententiis, sic in facetiis. Dixi enim dudum, materiam aliam esse ioci, aliam severitatis; gravium autem et iocorum unam esse rationem. <note type="margin" n="263">263</note> Ornant igitur in primis orationem verba relata contrarie, quod idem genus saepe est etiam facetum, ut Servius ille Galba, cum iudices L. Scribonio tribuno plebis ferret familiares suos, et dixisset Libo, ' Quando tandem, Galba, de triclinio tuo exibis? ' ' Cum tu,' inquit, ' de cubiculo alieno.' A quo genere ne illud quidem plurimum distat, quod Glaucia Metello,' Villam in Tiburte habes, cortem in Palatio.'

Ac verborum quidem genera, quae essent faceta, dixisse me puto; rerum plura sunt, eaque magis, ut dixi ante, ridentur; in quibus est narratio, res sane difficilis; exprimenda enim sunt et ponenda ante oculos ea quae videantur et verisimilia, quod est proprium narrationis, et quae sint, quod ridiculi pro-

Et ad hoc genus ascribamus etiam narrationes apologorum; <note type="margin" n="265">265</note> trahitur etiam aliquid ex historia, ut, cum Sex. Titius se Cassandram esse diceret, ' Multos,' inquit Antonius, ' possum tuos Aiaces Oileos nominare.'
Est etiam ex similitudine, quae aut collationem habet aut tanquam imaginem: collationem, ut ille Gallus olim testis in Pisonem, cum innumerabilem Magio praefecto pecuniam dixisset datam, idque Scaurus tenuitate Magii redargueret: ' Erras,' inquit, ' Scaure; ego enim Magium non conservasse dico, sed tanquam nudus nuces legeret, in ventre abstulisse'; ut ille M.

<note type="margin" n="272">272</note> Est huic finitimum dissimulationi cum honesto verbo vitiosa res appellatur: ut cum Africanus censor tribu movebat eum centurionem qui in Pauli pugna non adfuerat, cum ille se custodiae causa diceret in castris remansisse quaereretque cur ab eo notaretur, ' Non amo,' inquit, ' nimium diligentes.' <note type="margin" n="273">273</note> Acutum etiam illud est cum ex alterius oratione aliud excipias atque ille vult; ut Salinatori Maximus cum Tarento amisso arcem tamen Livius retinuisset multaque ex ea proelia praeclara fecisset, cum aliquot post annos Maximus id oppidum recepisset, rogaretque eum Salinator ut meminisset opera sua se Tarentum recepisse; 'Quidni,' inquit, 'meminerim? nunquam ego recepissem nisi tu perdidisses.'

Ab hoc vero Crasso nihil facetius: cum laesisset testis Silus Pisonem quod se in eum audisse dixisset, ' Potest fieri,' inquit, ' Sile, ut is unde te audisse dicis, iratus dixerit.' Annuit Silus. ' Potest etiam, ut tu non recte intellexeris.' Id quoque toto capite annuit, ut se Crasso daret. ' Potest etiam fieri,' inquit,' ut omnino, quod te audisse dicis, nunquam audieris.'

                        APPENDIX
                        Book I, § 41 (p. 30). qui aut interdicto . . . temere irruisses. In legal disputes as to possession the interdictum was a preliminary order of the praetor intended to secure for one of the litigants interim possession of the disputed property, so as to make him defendant in the subsequent real action and cast the burden of proof upon the other as plaintiff. Consertio manus was the stage in the real action at which the parties simulated the physical struggle of lawless times, by laying hands together upon the property and making claim and counterclaim to the ownership. In the case of land this formality took place out of court.
                        Book I, § 42 (pp. 30-32). Agerent enim tecum lege . . . non liceret. Legis actiones, of five types, were the remedies at the earliest stage of developed Roman legal procedure: they involved a rigid and elaborate ritual, in which the slightest slip was fatal to the blunderer's case. Sacramentum was one of these types, involving a pecuniary deposit by each litigant. The winner of the action recovered his sacramentum, while the loser's was forfeited to the State.
                        Book I, § 178 (p. 122). defendebamus . . . praestare debere. By this time Roman Law had apparently evolved the rule that a vendor of immovable property warrants the purchaser against all such material defects in his title as he does not disclose. The English rule is the same.
                        Book I, § 180 (p. 124). antequam in suam tutelam venisset. A boy emerged from guardianship at the age of fourteen. In this famous causa Curiana a testator had left his estate to his expected posthumous child, with a gift over to Curius in the event of such child dying under age. After all no child was born. Was the condition of death under age fulfilled by the default of birth? Crassus successfully maintained the affirmative, and Curius took under the will.

    <milestone unit="section" n="1"/>I. When, as often happens, brother Quintus, I think over and recall the days of old, those men always seem to me to have been singularly happy who, with the State at her best, and while enjoying
    high distinctions and the fame of their achievements, were able to maintain such a course of life that they could either engage in activity that involved no risk or enjoy a dignified repose. And time was when I used to imagine that I too should become entitled, with wellnigh universal approval, to some opportunity of leisure and of again directing my mind to the sublime pursuits beloved of us both, when once, the career of office complete and life too taking the turn towards its close,<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a The metaphors are borrowed from the Circus. Decursu honorum = decursis honoribus: Cicero had been successively augur, quaestor, aedile, praetor, consul and proconsul.</note> the endless toil of public speaking and the business of canvassing should have come to a standstill. <note type="margin" n="2">2</note> The hopes so born of my thoughts and plans have been cheated, alike by the disastrous times of public peril and by my manifold personal

    misfortunes. For the time of life which promised to be fullest of quiet and peace proved to be that during which the greatest volume of vexations and the most turbulent tempests arose. And notwithstanding my desire, and indeed my profound longing, no enjoyment of leisure was granted me, for the cultivation and renewed pursuit, in your company, of those arts to which from boyhood you and I have been devoted. <note type="margin" n="3">3</note> For in my early years<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a Cicero was about eighteen years old at the outbreak of the civil strife between Marius and Sulla.</note> I came just upon the days when the old order was overthrown; then by my consulship I was drawn into the midst of a universal struggle and crisis, and my whole time ever since that consulship I have spent in stemming those billows which, stayed by my efforts from ruining the nation, rolled in a flood upon myself. But none the less, though events are thus harassing and my time so restricted, I will hearken to the call of our studies, and every moment of leisure allowed me by the perfidy of my enemies, the advocacy of my friends and my political duties, I will dedicate first and foremost to writing. <note type="margin" n="4">4</note> And when you, brother, exhort and request me, I will not fail you, for no man's authority or wish can have greater weight with me than yours.

    <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>II. And now I must bring back to mind the recollection of an old story, not, I admit, as clear in detail as it might be, but, to my thinking, suited to what you ask; so that you may learn what men renowned above all others for eloquence have thought about the whole subject of oratory. <note type="margin" n="5">5</note> For it is your wish, as you have often told me, that—since the unfinished and crude essays,<note type="footnote" n="b" place="opposite">b The reference is to the juvenile De Inventione of Cicero, in two books.</note> which slipped out of the notebooks of my boyhood, or rather of my youth, are hardly worthy of my present time of life and of my experi-

    ence gained from the numerous and grave causes in which I have been engaged—I should publish something more polished and complete on these same topics; and generally you disagree with me, in our occasional discussions of this subject, because I hold that eloquence is dependent upon the trained skill of highly educated men, while you consider that it must be separated from the refinements of learning and made to depend on a sort of natural talent and on practice.
    <note type="margin" n="6">6</note> <note type="margin">Great orators—why rare.</note> And for my own part, when, as has often happened, I have been contemplating men of the highest eminence and endowed with the highest abilities, it has seemed to me to be a matter for inquiry, why it was that more of them should have gained outstanding renown in all other pursuits, than have done so in oratory. For in whatever direction you turn your mind and thoughts, you will find very many excelling in every kind, not merely of ordinary arts, but of such as are almost the greatest. <note type="margin" n="7">7</note> Who, for instance, in seeking to measure the understanding possessed by illustrious men, whether by the usefulness or the grandeur of their achievements, would not place the general above the orator? Yet who could doubt that, from this country alone, we could cite almost innumerable examples of leaders in war of the greatest distinction, but of men excelling in oratory a mere handful? <note type="margin" n="8">8</note> Nay further, among the men who by their counsel and wisdom could control and direct the helm of state, many have stood out in our own day, and still more in the history of our fathers and even of our remoter ancestors, and yet through lengthy ages no good orator is to be found, and in each successive generation hardly a single tolerable

    one. And that no one may think that other pursuits, which have to do with abstruse branches of study, and what I may call the varied field of learning, should be compared with this art of oratory, rather than the merits of a commander or the wisdom of a statesman-like senator, let him turn his attention to these very kinds of art, and look around to see who, and how many, have been distinguished therein; in this way he will most readily judge how scarce orators are now, and ever have been.
    <note type="margin" n="9">9</note> <note type="margin">Eminence in all fields rare.</note> <milestone unit="section" n="3"/> III. For indeed you cannot fail to remember that the most learned men hold what the Greeks call 'philosophy ' to be the creator and mother, as it were, of all the reputable arts, and yet in this field of philosophy it is difficult to count how many men there have been, eminent for their learning and for the variety and extent of their studies, men whose efforts were devoted, not to one separate branch of study, but who have mastered everything they could whether by scientific investigation or by the methods of dialectic. <note type="margin" n="10">10</note> Who does not know, as regards the so-called mathematicians, what very obscure subjects, and how abstruse, manifold, and exact an art they are engaged in? Yet in this pursuit so many men have displayed outstanding excellence, that hardly one seems to have worked in real earnest at this branch of knowledge without attaining the object of his desire. Who has devoted himself wholly to the cult of the Muses, or to this study of literature, which is professed by those who are known as men of letters, without bringing within the compass of his knowledge and observation the almost boundless range and subject-matter of those arts?
    <note type="margin" n="11">11</note> I think I shall be right in affirming this, that out of

    all those who have been engaged in the infinitely copious studies and learning pertaining to these arts, the smallest number of distinguished men is found among poets and orators<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a The traditional reading omits the words et oratorum, but their insertion seems necessary to the sense, and is supported by O. Hense, Harnecker, Wilkins and Stangl.</note>; and even in this small number—within which a man of excellence very rarely emerges—if you will make a careful comparison of our own national supply and that of Greece, far fewer good orators will be found even than good poets. <note type="margin" n="12">12</note> And this should seem even more marvellous because the subjects of the other arts are derived as a rule from hidden and remote sources, while the whole art of oratory lies open to the view, and is concerned in some measure with the common practice, custom, and speech of mankind, so that, whereas in all other arts that is most excellent which is farthest removed from the understanding and mental capacity of the untrained, in oratory the very cardinal sin is to depart from the language of everyday life, and the usage approved

    <note type="margin">Oratory an attractive but difficult study.</note>
    <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>IV. And yet it cannot truly be said either that more men devote themselves to the other arts, or that those who do so are stimulated to close study . by greater pleasure, higher hopes, or more splendid rewards. In fact, to say nothing of Greece, which has ever claimed the leading part in eloquence, and of Athens, that discoverer of all learning, where the supreme power of oratory was both invented and perfected, in this city of our own assuredly no studies have ever had a more vigorous life than those having to do with the art of speaking.
    <note type="margin" n="14">14</note> For as soon as our world-empire had been established, and an enduring peace had assured us leisure, there was hardly a youth, athirst for fame, who did

<p>
    not deem it his duty to strive with might and main after eloquence. At first indeed, in their complete ignorance of method, since they thought there was no definite course of training or any rules of art, they used to attain what skill they could by means of their natural ability and of reflection. But later, having heard the Greek orators, gained acquaintance with their literature and called in Greek teachers, our people were fired with a really incredible enthusiasm for eloquence. <note type="margin" n="15">15</note> The importance, variety, and frequency of current suits of all sorts aroused them so effectually, that, to the learning which each man had acquired by his own efforts, plenty of practice was added, as being better than the maxims of all the masters. In those days too, as at present, the prizes open to this study were supreme, in the way of popularity, wealth, and reputation alike. As for ability again—there are many things to show it— our fellow-countrymen have far excelled the men of every other race. <note type="margin" n="16">16</note> And considering all this, who would not rightly marvel that, in all the long record of ages, times, and states, so small a number of orators is to be found?
But the truth is that this oratory is a greater thing, and has its sources in more arts and branches of study, than people suppose.
    <note type="margin">Its wide demands on the student;</note>
    <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>V. For, where the number of students is very great, the supply of masters of the very best, the quality of natural ability outstanding, the variety of issues unlimited, the prizes open to eloquence exceedingly splendid, what else could anyone think to be the cause, unless it be the really incredible vastness and difficulty of the subject? <note type="margin" n="17">17</note> To begin with, a knowledge of very many matters must be grasped, without which
</p>
    
    
    <pb n="15"/>
<p>
    oratory is but an empty and ridiculous swirl of verbiage: and the distinctive style has to be formed, not only by the choice of words, but also by the arrangement of the same; and all the mental emotions, with which nature has endowed the human race, are to be intimately understood, because it is in calming or kindling the feelings of the audience that the full power and science of oratory are to be brought into play. To this there should be added a certain humour, flashes of wit, the culture befitting a gentleman, and readiness and terseness alike in repelling and in delivering the attack, the whole being combined with a delicate charm and urbanity. <note type="margin" n="18">18</note> Further, the complete history of the past and a store of precedents must be retained in the memory, nor may a knowledge of statute law and our national law in general be omitted. And why should I go on to describe the speaker's delivery? That needs to be controlled by bodily carriage, gesture, play of features and changing intonation of voice; and how important that is wholly by itself, the actor's trivial art and the stage proclaim; for there, although all are labouring to regulate the expression, the voice, and the movements of the body, everyone knows how few actors there are, or ever have been, whom we could bear to watch! What need to speak of that universal treasure-house the memory? Unless this faculty be placed in charge of the ideas and phrases which have been thought out and well weighed, even though as conceived by the orator they were of the highest excellence, we know that they will all be wasted.
    <note type="margin" n="19">19</note> Let us therefore cease to wonder what may be the cause of the rarity of orators, since oratory is the result of a whole number of things, in any one of which

    to succeed is a great achievement, and let us rather exhort our children, and the others whose fame and repute are dear to us, to form a true understanding of the greatness of their task, and not to believe that they can gain their coveted object by reliance on the rules or teachers or methods of practice employed by everybody, but to rest assured that they can do this by the help of certain other means.
    <note type="margin" n="20">20</note>
    <note type="margin">even if only pursued for practical purposes, as at Rome.</note>
    <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>VI. And indeed in my opinion, no man can be an orator complete in all points of merit, who has not attained a knowledge of all important subjects and arts. For it is from knowledge that oratory must derive its beauty and fullness, and unless there is such knowledge, well-grasped and comprehended by the speaker, there must be something empty and almost childish in the utterance. <note type="margin" n="21">21</note> Not that I am going to lay so heavy a burden upon orators—least of all upon our own, amid all the distractions of life in Rome— as to hold that there is nothing of which it is permissible for them to be ignorant, although the significance of the term " orator," and the mere act of professing eloquence, seem to undertake and to promise that every subject whatsoever, proposed to an orator, will be treated by him with both distinction and knowledge. <note type="margin" n="22">22</note> But being assured that to most men this appears a vast and indeed limitless enterprise, and perceiving that the Greeks, men not only abounding in genius and learning, but also amply endowed with leisure and the love of study, have already made a sort of division of the arts,—nor did every student of theirs work over the whole field by himself, but they separated from other uses of speech that portion of oratory which is concerned with the public discussions of the law-courts and of

most eloquent of our nation, and of the highest rank in distinction of every kind. Not that I despise what the Greek craftsmen and teachers of oratory have left us; but that is open to the view and ready to the hand of every man, nor could it be more happily set forth or more clearly expounded by any interpretations of my own, so that you will forgive me, brother mine, I do believe, if I prefer to Greek instruction the authoritative judgement of those to whom the highest honours in eloquence have been awarded by our own fellow-countrymen.

I remember then being told how, at the time, when Philippus,<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a For Philippus and Drusus see Index, and for the other names referred to in this chapter see Introduction.</note> though consul, was furiously assailing the policy of the leading men, and the tribune-ship of Drusus, undertaken in support of the power of the Senate, had begun to show symptoms of shock and weakness, Lucius Crassus, on the plea of recruiting his energies, betook himself during the days of the Roman Games to his seat at Tusculum, whither (as the story went) there came Quintus Mucius, once his father-in-law, and Marcus Antonius, a partner in the political designs of Crassus, and a man united with him in the closest intimacy. <note type="margin" n="25">25</note> There had also gone out of town, in the company of Crassus, two young men who were very
</p>





<pb n="21"/>
<p>
    great friends of Drusus, and in whom the older generation at that time reposed high hopes of their maintaining the traditions of their order: they were Gaius Cotta, just then seeking the tribuneship of the commons, and Publius Sulpicius, who was thought likely to become a candidate for that magistracy in succession to him. <note type="margin" n="26">26</note> This party, on the first day and up to a very late hour, held long debate together, concerning the crisis and the state of politics generally, which in fact had been the occasion of their meeting. And Cotta recounted many things which were spoken of in that discussion with deep regret by the three speakers of consular rank, in such inspired fashion that (in his words) no evil had since befallen the community which those men, so long before, had not seen to be hanging over it; <note type="margin" n="27">27</note> but (he would add) when the colloquy was completely finished, so exquisite was the urbanity displayed by Crassus, that, as soon as they had bathed and settled down to table, the melancholy turn taken by the earlier discussion was wholly banished, and such was the man's pleasantness and so great the charm of his humour that it seemed as though a day in the Senate-house was closing with supper at Tusculum.
    <note type="margin" n="28">28</note> Then Cotta went on to say how on the morrow, when those older men had rested sufficiently and everyone had come into the garden-walk, Scaevola, after taking two or three turns, observed, " Crassus, why do we not imitate Socrates as he appears in the Phaedrus of Plato? For your plane-tree has suggested this comparison to my mind, casting as it does, with its spreading branches, as deep a shade over this spot, as that one cast whose shelter Socrates sought<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a Phaedrus 229 A, 230 B.</note>,— which to me seems to owe its eminence less to ' the</p>

<p>
    little rivulet' described by Plato than to the language of his dialogue—and what Socrates did, whose feet were thoroughly hardened, when he threw himself down on the grass and so began the talk which philosophers say was divine,—such ease surely may more reasonably be conceded to my own feet." <note type="margin" n="29">29</note> " Nay," answered Crassus, " but we will make things more comfortable still," whereupon, according to Cotta, he called for cushions, and they all sat down together on the benches that were under the plane-tree.
    <note type="margin">Thesis: the importance of oratory to society and the state.</note>
    <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>VIII. In that place, as Cotta was fond of relating. Crassus introduced a conversation on the pursuit of oratory, with a view to relieving all minds from the discourse of the day before. <note type="margin" n="30">30</note> He began by saying that Sulpicius and Cotta seemed not to need exhortation from him but rather commendation, seeing that
    thus early they had acquired such skill as not merely to be ranked above their equals in age, but to be comparable with their elders. " Moreover," he continued, " there is to my mind no more excellent thing than the power, by means of oratory, to get a hold on assemblies of men, win their good will, direct their inclinations wherever the speaker wishes, or divert them from whatever he wishes. In every free nation, and most of all in communities which have attained the enjoyment of peace and tranquillity, this one art has always flourished above the rest and ever reigned supreme. <note type="margin" n="31">31</note> For what is so marvellous as that, out of the innumerable company of mankind, a single being should arise, who either alone or with a few others can make effective a faculty bestowed by nature upon every man? Or what so pleasing to the understanding and the ear as a speech adorned and polished with wise reflections and dignified language? Or</p>





<pb n="25"/>
<p>
    what achievement so mighty and glorious as that the impulses of the crowd, the consciences of the judges, the austerity of the Senate, should suffer transformation through the eloquence of one man? <note type="margin" n="32">32</note> What function again is so kingly, so worthy of the free, so generous, as to bring help to the suppliant, to raise up those that are cast down, to bestow security, to set free from peril, to maintain men in their civil rights? What too is so indispensable as to have always in your grasp weapons wherewith you can defend yourself, or challenge the wicked man, or when provoked take your revenge?
    " Nay more (not to have you for ever contemplating public affairs, the bench, the platform, and the Senate-house), what in hours of ease can be a pleasanter thing or one more characteristic of culture, than discourse that is graceful and nowhere uninstructed? For the one point in which we have our very greatest advantage over the brute creation is that we hold converse one with another, and can reproduce our thought in word. <note type="margin" n="33">33</note> Who therefore would not rightly admire this faculty, and deem it his duty to exert himself to the utmost in this field, that by so doing he may surpass men themselves in that particular respect wherein chiefly men are superior to animals? To come, however, at length to the highest achievements of eloquence, what other power could have been strong enough either to gather scattered humanity into one place, or to lead it out of its brutish existence in the wilderness up to our present condition of civilization as men and as citizens, or, after the establishment of social communities, to give shape to laws, tribunals, and civic rights? <note type="margin" n="34">34</note> And not to pursue any further instances—wellnigh countless as they are—I will</p>





<pb n="27"/>
<p>
    conclude the whole matter in a few words, for my assertion is this: that the wise control of the complete orator is that which chiefly upholds not only his own dignity, but the safety of countless individuals and of the entire State. Go forward therefore, my young friends, in your present course, and bend your energies to that study which engages you, that so it may be in your power to become a glory to yourselves, a source of service to your friends, and profitable members of the Republic."

For I listened to their most eminent men, on my arrival in Athens as a quaestor from Macedonia, at a time when the Academy was at its best, as was then asserted, with Charmadas, Clitomachus and Aeschines to uphold it. There was also Metrodorus, who, together with the others, had been a really diligent disciple of the illustrious Carneades himself, a speaker who, for spirited and copious oratory, surpassed, it was said, all other men. Mnesarchus too was in his prime, a pupil of your great Panaetius, and Diodorus, who studied under Critolaus the Peripatetic. <note type="margin" n="46">46</note> There were many others besides, of distinguished fame as philosophers, by all of whom, with one voice as it were, I perceived that the orator was driven from the helm of State, shut out from all learning and knowledge of more important things, and thrust down and locked up exclusively in law-courts and petty little assemblies, as if in a pounding-mill. <note type="margin" n="47">47</note> But I was neither in agreement with these men, nor with the author and originator of such discussions, who spoke with far more weight and eloquence than all of them—I mean Plato—whose Gorgias I read with close attention under Charmadas during those days at Athens, and what impressed me most deeply about Plato in that book was, that it was when making</p>

    fun of orators that he himself seemed to me to be the consummate orator. In fact controversy about a word has long tormented those Greeklings, fonder as they are of argument than of truth. <note type="margin" n="48">48</note> For, if anyone lays it down that an orator is a man whose sole power is that of speaking copiously before the Praetor or at a trial, or in the public assembly or the Senate-house, none the less even to an orator thus limited such critic must grant and allow a number of attributes, inasmuch as without extensive handling of all public business, without a mastery of ordinances, customs and general law, without a knowledge of human nature and character, he cannot engage, with the requisite cleverness and skill, even in these restricted activities. But to a man who has learned these things, without which no one can properly ensure even those primary essentials of advocacy, can there be anything lacking that belongs to the knowledge of the highest matters? If, on the other hand, you would narrow the idea of oratory to nothing but the speaking in ordered fashion, gracefully and copiously, how, I ask, could your orator attain even so much, if he were to lack that knowledge whereof you people deny him the possession? For excellence in speaking cannot be made manifest unless the speaker fully comprehends the matter he speaks about. <note type="margin" n="49">49</note> It follows that, if the famous natural philosopher Democritus spoke with elegance, as he is reported and appears to me to have spoken, those notable subjects of his discourse belonged to the natural philosopher, but his actual elegance of diction must be put down to the orator. And if Plato spoke with the voice of a god of things very far away from political debate, as I allow that he did, if again Aristotle and</p>

<p>
    Theophrastus and Carneades, on the themes which they treated, were eloquent and displayed charm of style and literary form, then, granting that the topics of their discourse may be found in certain other fields of research, yet their actual style is the peculiar product of this pursuit which we are now discussing and investigating, and of no other. <note type="margin" n="50">50</note> For we see that sundry authorities dealt with these same subjects in spiritless and feeble fashion, Chrysippus for instance, reputed as he is to have been the most acute of disputants, and not to have failed to meet the requirements of philosophy just because he had not acquired this gift of eloquence from an alien art.

" What then is the difference, or by what means will you discriminate between the rich and copious diction of those speakers whom I have mentioned, and the feebleness of such as do not adopt this variety and elegance of language? The sole distinction will surely be that the good speakers bring, as their peculiar possession, a style that is harmonious, graceful, and marked by a certain artistry and polish. Yet this style, if the underlying subject-matter be not comprehended and mastered by the speaker, must inevitably be of no account or even become the sport of universal derision. <note type="margin" n="51">51</note> For what so effectually proclaims the madman as the hollow thundering of words —be they never so choice and resplendent—which have no thought or knowledge behind them? Therefore whatever the theme, from whatever art or whatever branch of knowledge it be taken, the orator, just as if he had got up the case for a client, will state it better and more gracefully than the actual discoverer and the specialist. <note type="margin" n="52">52</note> For if anyone is going to affirm that there are certain ideas and subjects which speci-</p>

Wherefore the speaker will not be able to achieve what he wants by his words, unless he has gained profound insight into the characters of men, and the whole range of human nature, and those motives whereby our souls are spurred on or turned back. <note type="margin" n="54">54</note> And all this is considered to be the special province of philosophers, nor will the orator, if he take my advice, resist their claim; but when he has granted their knowledge of these things, since they have devoted all their labour to that alone, still he will assert his own claim to the oratorical treatment of them, which without that knowledge of theirs is nothing at all. For this is the essential concern of the orator, as I have often said before,—a style that is dignified and graceful and in conformity with the general modes of thought and judgement.

But when I have allowed that they may debate these subjects in their holes and corners, to pass an idle hour, it is to the orator none the less that I shall entrust and assign the task of developing with complete charm and cogency the same themes which they discuss in a sort of thin and bloodless style. <note type="margin" n="57">57</note> These points I used to argue at Athens with the philosophers in person, under pressure from our friend Marcus Marcellus, who is now Aedile of the Chair,<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a The ' curule' aediles were distinguished from the aediles plebis by their right to use the sella curulis and the toga praetexta.</note> and assuredly, if he were not at this moment producing the Games, would be taking part in our present colloquy; indeed even in those days of his early youth his devotion to these studies was marvellous.

"Indeed in handling those causes which everybody acknowledges to be within the exclusive sphere of oratory, there is not seldom something to be brought forth and employed, not from practice in public speaking—the only thing you allow the orator —but from some more abstruse branch of knowledge. <note type="margin" n="60">60</note> I ask, for instance, whether an advocate can either assail or defend a commander-in-chief without experience of the art of war, or sometimes too without knowledge of the various regions of land or sea? Whether he can address the popular assembly in favour of the passing or rejection of legislative proposals, or the Senate concerning any of the departments of State administration, if he lack consummate knowledge — practical as well as theoretical — of political science? Whether a speech can be directed to inflaming or even repressing feeling and passion —a faculty of the first importance to the orator— unless the speaker has made a most careful search into all those theories respecting the natural characters and the habits of conduct of mankind, which are unfolded by the philosophers?

So too, if Marcus Antonius here had had to speak on behalf of Hermodorus upon the construction of dockyards, having got up his case from his client, he would then have discoursed gracefully and copiously of an art to which he was not a stranger. Asclepiades also, he with whom we have been familiar both as physician and as friend, at the time when he was surpassing the rest of his profession in eloquence, was exhibiting, in such graceful speaking, the skill of an orator, not that of a physician. <note type="margin" n="63">63</note> In fact that favourite assertion of Socrates—that every man was eloquent enough upon a subject that he knew—has in it some plausibility but no truth: it is nearer the truth to say that neither can anyone be eloquent upon a subject that is unknown to him, nor, if he knows it perfectly and yet does not know how to shape and polish his style, can he speak fluently even upon that which he does know.

    the topic that crops up to be unfolded in discourse, will speak thereon with knowledge, method, charm and retentive memory, combining with these qualifications a certain distinction of bearing. <note type="margin" n="65">65</note> If however someone considers my expression ' whatever the topic ' to be altogether too extensive, he may clip and prune it to his individual taste, but to this much I shall hold fast—though the orator be ignorant of what is to be found in all the other arts and branches of study, and know only what is dealt with in debate and the practice of public-speaking; none the less, if he should have to discourse even on these other subjects, then after learning the technicalities of each from those who know the same, the orator will speak about them far better than even the men who are masters of these arts. <note type="margin" n="66">66</note> For example, should our friend Sulpicius here have to speak upon the art of war, he will inquire of our relative Gaius Marius, and when he has received his teachings, will deliver himself in such fashion as to seem even to Gaius Marius to be almost better informed on the subject than Gaius Marius himself; while if his topic is to be the law of private rights, he will consult yourself and, notwithstanding your consummate learning and skill in these very things which you have taught him, he will surpass you in the art of exposition. <note type="margin" n="67">67</note> If again some matter should confront him wherein he must speak of human nature, human vices or the passions, of moderation or self-control, of sorrow or death, then perhaps if he thinks fit—although an orator must have knowledge of such things—he will have taken counsel with Sextus Pompeius, a man accomplished in moral science; so much he will assuredly achieve, that whatever his subject and whoever his instructor, on</p>

    that subject he will express himself far more gracefully than his master himself. <note type="margin" n="68">68</note> Nevertheless, if he will listen to me, since philosophy is divided into three branches, which respectively deal with the mysteries of nature, with the subtleties of dialectic, and with human life and conduct, let us quit claim to the first two, by way of concession to our indolence, but unless we keep our hold on the third, which has ever been the orator's province, we shall leave the orator no sphere wherein to attain greatness. <note type="margin" n="69">69</note> For which reason this division of philosophy, concerned with human life and manners, must all of it be mastered by the orator; as for the other matters, even though he has not studied them, he will still be able, whenever the necessity arises, to beautify them by his eloquence, if only they are brought to his notice and described to him.

    the other side, among them too being that Menedemus, who was lately in Rome as my guest; and when he asserted that there was a special sort of wisdom, which had to do with investigating the principles of founding and governing political communities, this roused up a man of quick temper<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a Charmadas of the Academy.</note> and full to overflowing of learning of every kind and a really incredible diversity and multiplicity of facts. For he proceeded to inform us that every part of this same wisdom had to be sought from philosophy, nor were those institutions in a State which dealt with the immortal gods, the training of youth, justice, endurance, self-control, or moderation in all things, or the other principles without which States could not exist or at any rate be well-conditioned, to be met with anywhere in the paltry treatises of rhetoricians. <note type="margin" n="86">86</note> Whereas, if those teachers of rhetoric embraced within their art so vast a multitude of the noblest themes, how was it, he inquired, that their books were stuffed full of maxims relating to prefaces, perorations and similar trumpery—for so did he describe them—while concerning the organization of States, or the drafting of laws, or on the topics of fair-dealing, justice, loyalty, or the subduing of the passions or the building of human character, not a syllable was to be found in their pages? <note type="margin" n="87">87</note> But as for their actual rules he would scoff at them by showing that not only were their authors devoid of that wisdom which they arrogated</p>

    to themselves, but they were ignorant even of the true principles and methods of eloquence. For he was of opinion that the main object of the orator was that he should both appear himself, to those before whom he was pleading, to be such a man as he would desire to seem (an end to be attained by a reputable mode of life, as to which those teachers of rhetoric had left no hint among their instructions), and that the hearts of his hearers should be touched in such fashion as the orator would have them touched (another purpose only to be achieved by a speaker who had investigated all the ways wherein, and all the allurements and kind of diction whereby, the judgement of men might be inclined to this side or to that); but according to him such knowledge lay thrust away and buried deep in the very heart of philosophy, and those rhetoricians had not so much as tasted it with the tip of the tongue. <note type="margin" n="88">88</note> These assertions Menedemus would strive to disprove by quoting instances rather than by arguments, for, while reciting from his ready recollection many magnificent passages from the speeches of Demosthenes, he would demonstrate how that orator, when by his eloquence he was compelling the passions of the judges or of the people to take any direction he chose, knew well enough by what means to attain results which Charmadas would say that no one could compass without the aid of philosophy.
    <note type="margin" n="89">89</note> <milestone unit="section" n="20"/> XX. " To this Charmadas replied that he did not deny to Demosthenes the possession of consummate wisdom and the highest power of eloquence, but whether Demosthenes owed this ability to natural talent or, as was generally agreed, had been a devoted disciple of Plato, the present question was not what Demosthenes could do, but what those</p>

    rhetoricians were teaching. <note type="margin" n="90">90</note> More than once too he was carried so far away by his discourse as to argue that there was no such thing as an art of eloquence; and after showing this by arguments—because, as he said, we were born with an aptitude alike for coaxing and unctuously stealing into favour with those from whom a boon had to be sought, and for daunting our antagonists by threats, for setting forth how a deed was done, and establishing our own charges and disproving the allegations of the other side, and for making, in the closing words of a speech, some use of protest and lamentation (in which operations he declared that every resource of the orator was brought into play), and because habit and practice sharpened the edge of discernment and quickened the fluency of delivery, then he would also support his case by an abundance of instances. <note type="margin" n="91">91</note> For in the first place (he would say) not a single writer on rhetoric—it looked as if of set purpose—had been even moderately eloquent, and he searched all the way back to the days of one Corax<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a For Corax and Tisias see Index. By using the words nescio quo Antonius affects ignorance of literary history.</note> and a certain Tisias who, he stated, were acknowledged to have been the founders and first practitioners of this art, while on the other hand he would cite a countless host of very eloquent men who had never learned these rules or been at all anxious to make their acquaintance; and among these—whether in jest or because he thought so and had even so heard —he went on to mention me in the list, as one who had never studied those matters and yet (according to him) had some ability in oratory. To one of these points of his—that I had never learned anything—I readily agreed, but as to the other I considered that he was either making game of me or was even himself</p>

    mistaken. <note type="margin" n="92">92</note> He said, however, that there was no ' art' which did not consist in the knowledge and clear perception of facts, all tending to a single conclusion and incapable of misleading; but everything with which orators dealt was doubtful and uncertain, since all the talking was done by men who had no real grasp of their subject, and all the listening by hearers who were not to have knowledge conveyed to them, but some short-lived opinion that was either untrue or at least not clear. <note type="margin" n="93">93</note> In a word, he then looked like persuading me that no craft of oratory existed, and that no one could speak with address or copiously unless he had mastered the philosophical teachings of the most learned men. And in these discussions Charmadas was wont to speak with warm admiration of your talents, Crassus, explaining that he found in me a very ready listener, in yourself a most doughty antagonist.

got into the hands of the public—the statement that I had known sundry accomplished speakers, but no one so far who was eloquent, inasmuch as I held anyone to be an accomplished speaker who could deliver his thought with the necessary point and clearness before an everyday audience, and in accord with what I might call the mental outlook of the average human being, whereas I allowed the possession of eloquence to that man only who was able, in a style more admirable and more splendid, to amplify and adorn any subject he chose, and whose mind and memory encompassed all the sources of everything that concerned oratory.

    because, before we have entered on the required study, we are overwhelmed by the hunt for office and the business of the Bar, none the less let it be accepted as attainable in fact and in the nature of things. <note type="margin" n="95">95</note> For personally, so far as I can form a prediction, and judging from the vast supply of talent which I see existent among our fellow-citizens, I do not despair of its coming to pass that some day some one, keener in study than we are or ever have been, endowed with ampler leisure and earlier opportunity for learning, and exhibiting closer application and more intensive industry, who shall have given himself up to listening, reading and writing, will stand forth as an orator such as we are seeking, who may rightly be called not merely accomplished but actually eloquent; and after all, to my mind either Crassus is such a man already, or, should some one of equal natural ability have heard, read and written more than Crassus, he will only be able to improve to some slight extent upon him."
    <note type="margin" n="96">96</note> <note type="margin">Crassus reluctantly consents to give his views.</note> At this point, " We never looked for it," exclaimed Sulpicius, " but it has fallen out, Crassus, just as both I and Cotta earnestly hoped, I mean that you two should slip into this particular conversation. For on our way hither we were thinking that it would be delightful enough if, while you and Antonius were talking about anything else, we might still manage to catch from your discourse something worth remembering; but that you should enter at large upon so real and wellnigh exhaustive a discussion of this whole matter—be it practice, art or natural talent— seemed to us a thing we could hardly hope for. <note type="margin" n="97">97</note> The fact is that I, who from my earliest manhood was aglow with enthusiasm for you both, and a positive</p>

    devotion to Crassus—seeing that on no occasion did I leave his side—could never get a word out of him respecting the nature and theory of eloquence, although I pleaded in person, besides making frequent trial of him through the agency of Drusus, whereas on this subject you, Antonius,—and what I shall say is true—have never failed me at all in my probings or interrogatories, and have many a time explained to me what rules you were wont to observe in practical oratory. <note type="margin" n="98">98</note> Now then that each of you has opened up a way of reaching these very objects of our quest, and since it was Crassus who led off in this discussion, grant us the favour of recounting with exactness of detail, your respective opinions upon every branch of oratory. If we do win this boon from you both, I shall be deeply grateful, Crassus, to this school in your Tusculan villa, and shall rank these semi-rural training-quarters of yours far above the illustrious Academy and the Lyceum."
    <note type="margin" n="99">99</note> <milestone unit="section" n="22"/> XXII. Thereupon the other rejoined, " Nay, Sulpicius, but let us rather ask Antonius, who both has the ability to do what you demand, and, as I understand you to say, has been in the habit of so doing. For as for me, you yourself have just told us how I have invariably run away from all discussions of this sort, and time and again have refused compliance with your desire and indeed your importunity. This I used to do, not from arrogance or churlishness, nor because I was unwilling to gratify your entirely legitimate and admirable keenness—the more so as I had recognized that you were above all other men eminently endowed by nature and adapted for oratory —but in solemn truth it was from want of familiarity</p>

    <note type="margin" n="100">100</note> Cotta then observed, " Since we have secured what seemed most difficult—that you, Crassus, should say anything at all about these matters—as for what remains, it will now be our own fault if we let you go without explaining to us all that we have been inquiring about." <note type="margin" n="101">101</note> " Limiting the inquiry, I imagine," answered Crassus, " to those subjects which, as the phrase goes in accepting an inheritance, are within my knowledge and power." " By all means," returned Cotta, " for what is beyond your own power or knowledge, who among us is so shameless as to claim to be within his own? " " In that case," replied Crassus, " provided that I may disclaim powers which I do not possess, and admit ignorance of what I do not know,—put what questions to me you please." <note type="margin" n="102">102</note> <note type="margin">Is there a science of rhetoric?</note> “Well then," said Sulpicius, " what we ask you to tell us first is your opinion of the view Antonius advanced just now—whether you hold that there is any such thing as an ' art' of oratory?

Later, however, they began to do this everywhere, and are doing it to this day, with the result of there being no theme so vast, so unforeseen, or so novel, that they do not claim to be prepared to say about it all that there is to be said. <note type="margin" n="104">104</note> But had I supposed that you, Cotta, or you, Sulpicius, wished to listen to anything of the kind, I would have brought some Greek or other here to amuse you with discussions of that sort; and even now this can easily be managed. For staying with Marcus Piso (a young man, but already given up to this pursuit, possessing talent of the highest order and deeply devoted to myself) there is Staseas the Peripatetic, a man whom I know well enough, and who, as I understand to be agreed among experts, is quite supreme in that department of his."
    <note type="margin" n="105">105</note> <milestone unit="section" n="23"/> XXIII. " Staseas! what Staseas? what Peripatetic are you talking to me about? " said Mucius. " It is for you, Crassus, to comply with the wishes of young men, who do not want the everyday chatter of some unpractised Greek, or old sing-songs out of the schools, but something from the wisest and most eloquent man in the world, and one who, not in the pages of pamphlets, but in the most momentous causes, and that too in this seat of imperial power and splendour, holds the first place for judgement and eloquence; they are anxious to learn the opinion of the man whose footsteps they long to follow. <note type="margin" n="106">106</note> Moreover, just as I have always accounted you the ideal orator, even so I have never ascribed to you higher praise for eloquence than for kindliness, which quality it becomes you on the present occasion to exercise to the very utmost,</p>

    <note type="margin" n="107">107</note> <note type="margin">No, there is not a science in the strict sense, but experience can furnish a system of rules.</note> "For my part," answered the other, "I am anxious to humour your friends, and I shall make no difficulty about saying, in my brief fashion, what I think upon each point. And to that first question— since I do not think it dutiful, Scaevola, for me to disregard your claims—I answer, ' I think there is either no art of speaking at all or a very thin
    one,' all the quarrelling in learned circles being really based upon a dispute about a word. <note type="margin" n="108">108</note> For if, as Antonius just now explained, an art is defined as consisting in things thoroughly examined and clearly apprehended, and which are also outside the control of mere opinion, and within the grasp of exact knowledge, then to me there seems to be no such thing as an art of oratory. For all the kinds of language we ourselves use in public speaking are changeable matter, and adapted to the general understanding of the crowd. <note type="margin" n="109">109</note> If however the actual things noticed in the practice and conduct of speaking have been heeded and recorded by men of skill and experience, if they have been defined in terms, illuminated by classification, and distributed under subdivisions—and I see that it has been possible to do this—I do not understand why this should not be regarded as an art, perhaps not in that precise sense of the term, but at any rate according to the other and popular estimate. But whether this be an art, or only something like an art, assuredly it is not to be disdained; we must however understand that certain other qualifications are of greater consequence for the attainment of eloquence."</p>

    <milestone unit="section" n="24"/>XXIV. Thereupon Antonius observed that he heartily agreed with Crassus, in that he was neither wedded to Art with the devotion of those for whom the whole virtue of oratory resided in an art, nor on the other hand did he put her away altogether, as did most of the philosophers. " But I think, Crassus," he continued, " that you will be doing these two a favour, if you will set forth those things which in your opinion may be more profitable to oratory than even Art herself."
    <note type="margin" n="111">111</note> " I will certainly name them," replied Crassus, " as I have once begun, beseeching you however not to publish abroad these trifles of mine; although I too will restrain myself, so as not to seem a sort of master and professional, volunteering some observations of my own, but just one of all the many Roman citizens, a man modestly qualified through experience of public affairs, and not altogether untrained, who has stumbled by chance upon your discussion. <note type="margin" n="112">112</note> The truth is that, when in quest of an office, I used in canvassing to send Scaevola away from me, explaining to him that I proposed to be silly,<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a Ineptus, generally equivalent to ' unhappy' or ' incongruous,' is here used loosely as meaning ' silly.'

Yet he it is whom on the present occasion Fate has appointed to be an eye-witness and observer of my silliness. For what is sillier than to talk about talking, since talking in itself is ever a silly business, except when it is indispensable? "

    <note type="margin">The requirements of the orator: natural gifts are essential;</note>
    <milestone unit="section" n="25"/>XXV. " This then is my opinion," resumed Crassus, "that in the first place natural talent is the chief contributor to the virtue of oratory; and indeed in those writers on the art, of whom Antonius spoke
    just now, it was not the principles and method of oratory that were wanting, but inborn capacity. For certain lively activities of the intelligence and the talents alike should be present, such as to be at once swift in invention, copious in exposition and embellishment, and steadfast and enduring in recollection; <note type="margin" n="114">114</note> and if there be anyone disposed to think that these powers can be derived from art, a false belief—for it would be a glorious state of things if art could even kindle or waken them into life; engrafted and bestowed by art of a certainty they cannot be, for they are all the gifts of nature,— what will he say of those other attributes which undoubtedly are innate in the man himself: the ready tongue, the ringing tones, strong lungs, vigour, suitable build and shape of the face and body as a whole? <note type="margin" n="115">115</note> And, in saying this, I do not mean that art cannot in some cases give polish,—for well I know that good abilities may through instruction become better, and that such as are not of the best can nevertheless be, in some measure, quickened and amended—, but there are some men either so tongue-tied, or so discordant in tone, or so wild and boorish in feature and gesture, that, even though sound in talent and in art, they yet cannot enter the ranks of the orators. While others there are, so apt in these same respects, so completely furnished with the bounty of nature, as to seem of more than human birth, and to have been shaped by some divinity.

For there is hardly a soul present but will turn a keener and more penetrating eye upon defects in the speaker than upon his good points. Thus any blunder that may be committed eclipses even those other things that are praiseworthy. <note type="margin" n="117">117</note> Not that I am pressing these considerations with the idea of frightening young men away altogether from the pursuit of oratory, should they possibly lack some natural endowment. For who does not observe that Gaius Coelius, a man of my own time and of new family, reached high renown as the result of that very modest degree of eloquence which—such as it was— he had succeeded in attaining? Who again does not know that Quintus Varius, your own contemporary, a man of wild and repellent aspect, has attained great popularity in public life, through whatever practical ability of that kind he has possessed?

And now, if you would know it, among my most familiar friends I will publish in simple language what I think, on which I have hitherto always kept silence and deemed silence fitting. In my view, even the best orators, those who can speak with the utmost ease and elegance, unless they are diffident in approaching a discourse and diffident in beginning it, seem to border on the shameless, although that can never come to pass. <note type="margin" n="120">120</note> For the better the orator, the more profoundly is he frightened of the difficulty of speaking, and of the doubtful fate of a speech, and of the anticipations of an audience. On the other hand, the man who can do nothing in composition and delivery that is worthy of the occasion, worthy of the name of an orator, or of the ear of the listener, still seems to me to be without shame, be he never so agitated in his speaking; for it is not by feeling shame at what is unbecoming, but in not doing it, that we must escape the reproach of shamelessness. <note type="margin" n="121">121</note> While as for him who is unashamed—as I see is the case with most speakers,— I hold him deserving not merely of reprimand, but of punishment as well. Assuredly, just as I generally perceive it to happen to yourselves, so I very often prove it in my own experience, that I turn pale at the outset of a speech, and quake in every limb and in all my soul; in fact, as a very young man, I once so utterly lost heart in opening</p>

    <note type="margin" n="122">122</note> At this point the whole company began to nod approval one to another, and to talk together. For there was a marvellous kind of modesty about Crassus, though this was so far from being any disadvantage to his oratory, as positively to help it, by bearing witness to his integrity.
    <note type="margin">Orators judged less leniently than actors</note>
    <milestone unit="section" n="27"/> XXVII. Presently Antonius observed: " I have often noticed, Crassus, that, as you say, both you and the other orators of the first rank—although in my opinion no one has ever been your peer—are deeply disturbed when you are beginning a speech. <note type="margin" n="123">123</note> Now on investigating the reason of this—how it was that, the greater an orator's capacity, the more profoundly nervous he was — I discovered this twofold explanation: first, that those who had learned from experience and knowledge of human nature understood that, even with the most eminent orators, the fate of a speech was sometimes not sufficiently in accordance with their wish; wherefore, as often as they spoke, they were justifiably fearful, lest what could possibly happen sometime should actually happen then. <note type="margin" n="124">124</note> Secondly there is something of which I often have to complain, that, whenever tried and approved exponents of the other arts have done some work with less than their wonted success, their inability to perform what they knew how to perform is explained by their being out of the humour or hindered by indisposition (people say,' Roscius was not in the mood for acting to-day,' or ' He was a little out of sorts'); whereas, if it</p>





<pb n="89"/>

    is an orator's shortcoming that is being criticized the same is thought due to stupidity. <note type="margin" n="125">125</note> But stupidity finds no apology, since no man's stupidity is set down to his having been ' out of sorts ' or ' that way inclined.' And so in oratory we confront a sterner judgement. For judgement is passing upon us as often as we speak; moreover one mistake in acting does not instantly convict a player of ignorance of acting, but an orator, censured on some point of speaking, is under an established suspicion of dullness once for all, or at any rate for many a day.

    <milestone unit="section" n="28"/>XXVIII. " Now as for that remark of yours that there were very many qualifications which an orator must derive from nature, or he would not be greatly aided by tuition, I thoroughly agree with you; and in this respect I most particularly approved of that very eminent instructor Apollonius of Alabanda, who, though teaching for hire, would not for all that suffer such pupils as, in his judgement, could never turn out to be orators, to waste their labour with him, but would send them on their ways, and urge and exhort them to pursue those arts for which he thought them respectively fitted. <note type="margin" n="127">127</note> It is enough, indeed, for acquiring all other crafts, just to be a man like other men, and able to apprehend mentally and to preserve in the memory what is taught, or even crammed into the learner, should he chance to be dull beyond the ordinary. No readiness of tongue is needed, no fluency of language, in short none of those things—natural state of looks, expression, and voice—which we cannot mould for ourselves. <note type="margin" n="128">128</note> But in an orator we must demand the subtlety of the logician, the thoughts of the philosopher, a</p>

diction almost poetic, a lawyer's memory, a tragedian's voice, and the bearing almost of the consummate actor. Accordingly no rarer thing than a finished orator can be discovered among the sons of men. For attributes which are commended when acquired one apiece, and that in but modest degree, by other craftsmen in their respective vocations, cannot win approval when embodied in an orator, unless in him they are all assembled in perfection."
    <note type="margin" n="129">129</note> <note type="margin">Defects are noticed at once.</note> "And yet observe," said Crassus at this point, " how much more care is exercised in an extremely mean and trivial craft than in this art, which is admittedly the greatest. For again and again do
    I hear Roscius declaring that so far he has never succeeded in finding a single pupil of whom he really approved; not that there were not some who were acceptable, but because, if there was any blemish whatever in them, he himself could not endure it. For nothing stands out so conspicuously, or remains so firmly fixed in the memory, as something in which you have blundered. <note type="margin" n="130">130</note> And so, to take this comparison with this player as our standard of an orator's merit, do you not see how he does nothing otherwise than perfectly, nothing without consummate charm, nothing save in the manner befitting the occasion, and so as to move and enchant everybody? Accordingly he has long ago brought it about that, in whatsoever craft a man excelled, the same was called a Roscius in his own fine. For myself, in demanding in an orator this absolute perfection, from which I myself am far removed, I am behaving shamelessly, since I want forgiveness for myself, but I do not forgive the others.

    And the other answered: " For my part, it is precisely because I recognized in you two a really remarkable and indeed splendid genius for oratory, that I have set forth all these considerations, while to stimulate you men of ability no less than to discourage the inefficient is the object of my discourse; and although I have noted in both of you talent and industry of the highest order, still as regards these advantages which depend upon the outer man, concerning which I have perhaps said more than the Greeks are wont to do, as manifested in yourself, Sulpicius, they are divine. <note type="margin" n="132">132</note> For never, I think, did I listen to a speaker better qualified in respect of gesture, and by his very bearing and presence, or to one with a voice more resonant and pleasing; while those on whom these gifts have been bestowed by nature in smaller measure, can none the less acquire the power to use what they have with propriety and discernment, and so as to show no lack of good taste. For lack of that is above all else to be avoided, and as to this particular failing it is especially difficult to lay down rules, difficult not only for me, who talk of these matters like papa laying down the law, but even for the great Roscius himself; whom I often hear affirming that the chief thing in art is to observe good taste, though how to do this is the one thing that cannot be taught by art. <note type="margin" n="133">133</note> But, by your leave,</p>

    that, when you were longing to hear them, there was no ground for your longing. For I shall tell no mystery, nothing worthy of your waiting, nothing that you have not heard already, or that is new to anyone. For to begin with, in regard to what befits a free-born man of liberal education, I will not deny that I learned those commonplace and well-worn maxims of teachers in general: <note type="margin" n="138">138</note> first, that the duty of an orator is to speak in a style fitted to convince; next, that every speech has to do either with the investigation of a general question, wherein no persons or occasions are indicated, or with a problem that is concerned with specific individuals and times; <note type="margin" n="139">139</note> moreover that in both cases, whatever the subject for debate, it is usual for inquiry to be made in respect thereof, either whether a deed was done or, if it was done, what is its character, or again by what name is it known or, as some add, whether it appears to have been done lawfully;</p>

" I certainly approve," replied Crassus, " of what you yourselves are in the habit of doing, when you propound some case, closely resembling such as are brought into Court, and argue it in a fashion adapted as nearly as possible to real life. Most students however, in so doing, merely exercise their voices (and that in the wrong way), and their physical strength, and whip up their rate of utterance, and revel in a flood of verbiage. This mistake is due to their having heard it said that it is by speaking that men as a rule become speakers. <note type="margin" n="150">150</note> But that other adage is just as true,—that by speaking badly men very easily succeed in becoming bad speakers. This is why, in those exercises of your own, though there is a value in plenty of extempore speaking, it is still more serviceable to take time for consideration, and to speak better prepared and more carefully. But the chief thing is what, to tell the truth, we do least (for it needs great pains which most of us shirk),— to write as much as possible. The pen is the best and most eminent author and teacher of eloquence, and rightly so. For if an extempore and casual speech is easily beaten by one prepared and thought-out, this latter in turn will assuredly be surpassed by what has been written with care and diligence. <note type="margin" n="151">151</note> The truth is that all the commonplaces, whether furnished by art or by individual talent and wisdom, at any rate such as appertain to the subject of our writing, appear</p>

But later I noticed this defect in my method, that those words which best befitted each subject, and were the most elegant and in fact the best, had been already seized upon by Ennius, if it was on his poetry that I was practising, or by Gracchus,<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a The speeches of C. Gracchus (see Index) were studied as models in the rhetorical schools of the Empire.</note> if I chanced to have set myself a speech of his. Thus I saw that to employ the same expressions profited me nothing, while to employ others was a positive hindrance, in that I was forming the habit of using the less appropriate. <note type="margin" n="155">155</note> Afterwards I resolved,—and this practice I followed when somewhat older,—to translate freely Greek speeches of the most eminent orators. The result of reading these was that, in rendering into Latin what I had read in Greek, I not only found myself using the best words—and yet quite familiar ones—but also coining by analogy certain words such as would be new to our people, provided only they were appropriate.
    <note type="margin" n="156">156</note> " To proceed, the control and training of voice, breathing, gestures and the tongue itself, call for exertion rather than art; and in these matters we must carefully consider whom we are to take as patterns, whom we should wish to be like.

There is a vast difference between these gifts, and far apart are they sundered; nor was it by any uniform theory and method that Marcus Cato, Publius Africanus, Quintus Metellus and Gaius Laelius, orators all, gave brilliance to their own style and to the reputation of their community.

' Deliver us out of our woes, deliver us out of the jaws of those whose ferocity cannot get its fill of our blood; suffer us not to be in bondage to any, save to yourselves as a nation, whose slaves we can and ought to be.' I pass over ' woes,' in which, according to the philosophers, the brave can never become involved; I pass over ' jaws,' out of which you desire to be delivered, for fear of your blood being sucked out of you by an unjust judgement, a thing which they say cannot befall the wise; but ' slavery,' did you dare to say that not yourself only, but the entire Senate, whose interests you were that day upholding, could be slaves?

And as for your further pronouncement, that the Senate not only ' can' but actually ' ought to' be the slaves of the nation, could any philosopher be so unmanly, spiritless and weak, so resolved to make physical pleasure and pain the standard of everything, as to approve of this suggestion that the Senate is in bondage to the nation, when it is to the Senate that the nation itself has committed the power of controlling and guiding it, as some driver might hand over his reins?</p>

" And so, although I personally thought these  words of yours inspired, Publius Rutilius Rufus, a man of learning and devoted to philosophy, used to say they were not only wanting in discretion, but positively unseemly and disgraceful. He it was who used also to censure very severely Servius Galba, whom he claimed to remember well, for having worked upon the compassion of the assembly, when Lucius Scribonius was moving for his prosecution, after Marcus Cato, a troublesome and bitter foe to Galba, had harangued the Roman people in a rough and violent strain: this speech Cato himself has recorded in his Early History.
    <note type="margin" n="228">228</note> " As I was saying, Rutilius used to find fault with Galba, for having almost hoisted on to his shoulders, with his own hands, his ward Quintus, the son of his near relative Gaius Sulpicius Gallus, so that his appearance might set the assembly a-weeping, by recalling the memory of his most illustrious father; and for having committed two small sons of his own to the guardianship of the nation; and for having proclaimed, like a soldier making his will under arms, without scales or tablets, that he appointed the Roman people to be their guardians in their fatherless plight. The result, according to Rutilius, was that Galba, though at that time weighed down by popular ill-will and hatred, actually secured an acquittal by means of these histrionics, and I also find the incident recorded in Cato's book, with the comment that ' but for his employment of boys and blubbering, the accused would have got his deserts.'

For though, as you know, that great man was a pattern of righteousness, and there was no more honourable and blameless individual in the community, he declined not only to crave mercy of his judges, but also to be defended more eloquently or elaborately than the plain truth of the matter permitted. To Cotta here, though a highly accomplished young man and his sister's son, he allotted but a fragment of his case. Quintus Mucius too argued a part of it in his own way, with no trappings, his diction simple and crystal-clear.

As matters stand, a man of such quality has been lost, through his case being conducted as if the trial had been taking place in that ideal republic of Plato. None of his counsel groaned or shrieked, none was pained at anything, or made any complaint, or invoked the State, or humbled himself.

Indeed on Lysias, a most accomplished orator, bringing him a written speech, to be committed to memory, if he thought proper, for use in his defence at his trial, he read it not unwillingly, and said it was aptly phrased: ' But,' quoth he, ' just as, if you had brought me a pair of Sicyonian half-boots, were they never so easy and well-fitting, I should reject them as womanish, even so I think your speech is skilful oratory but not the utterance of a brave man.'

But as it is you admit that a man may be learned in the law without possessing this eloquence which we are investigating, and that many such have appeared; while you deny the possibility of the existence of an orator who has not acquired that legal knowledge as well. So by your account the learned lawyer, in and by himself, is nothing but a circumspect and sharp kind of pettifogger, a crier of legal actions, a chanter of legal formulas, a trapper of syllables; but, because the orator in Court often employs the aid of the law, you have therefore associated your legal knowledge with Eloquence, as a little maid to follow at her heels.

    Indeed in all those suits, as in that very one of Manius Curius, recently conducted by yourself, and in the dispute over Gaius Hostilius Mancinus, and again in the matter of the boy born of the second wife, before her predecessor had received notice of divorce, dissent as to the law was complete in the most learned circles. <note type="margin" n="239">239</note> <note type="margin">and then it is eloquence that wins.</note> I ask then, of what service was legal knowledge to an advocate in those cases, when that learned lawyer was bound to come off victorious, who had been upheld, not by his own dexterity but by a stranger's, that is to say, not by

" Often too have I heard how, when Publius Crassus was a candidate for the aedileship, and Servius Galba, his senior and a past consul, was in attendance upon him, having arranged a marriage between his son Gaius and the daughter of Crassus, a certain countryman approached Crassus to obtain his opinion: he took Crassus apart and laid the facts before him, but brought away from him advice that was more correct than conformable to his interest; whereupon Galba, noting his chagrin, accosted him by name, inquiring what the question was on which he had consulted Crassus. <note type="margin" n="240">240</note> Having heard the client's tale and observing his agitation, ' I see,' said he, ' that Crassus was preoccupied and distracted when he advised you ': he then seized Crassus himself by the hand and asked, ' How now, what ever entered your head to suggest such an opinion?' Upon this the other, with the assurance of profound knowledge, repeated that the position was as he had advised and the point unarguable. Galba however, sportively and with varied and manifold illustrations, brought forward a number of analogies, and urged many</p>





<pb n="175"/>
<p>
considerations in favour of equity as against rigid law, and it is related that Crassus, being no match for him in discussion—though ranked among the accomplished, Crassus came nowhere near Galba—, took refuge in authorities, and pointed out his own statement both in the works of his brother Publius Mucius, and in the text-book of Sextus Aelius, yet after all admitted that Galba's argument seemed to him persuasive, and very near the truth.

Does anyone claim an inheritance under a will made by the head of a household before the birth of a son of his? No one; since it is settled law that the will is revoked by such subsequent birth. Thus there are no judicial decisions on this branch of the law. And so the orator may safely disregard all this region of unquestionable law, being as it certainly is by far the larger portion of the science: <note type="margin" n="242">242</note> while, as for the law which is unsettled in the most learned circles, it is easy enough for him to find some authority in favour of whichever side he is supporting, and, having obtained a supply of thonged shafts<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a These were javelins with a slinging-strap to help the thrower.</note> from him, he himself will hurl these with all the might of an orator's arm. Unless indeed (let me say this by the kind indulgence of our excellent friend here Scaevola) it was by means of the works and maxims of your father-in-law that you argued the case for Manius Curius? Did you not rather snatch at the chance of protecting righteousness and upholding last wills and the intentions of dead men?

If again the dispute relates to a question of fact, or to boundaries, without our having a view of the very spot, or to account-books and entries, we are obliged to get up complicated and often troublesome matters: if we have to master statutes, or the opinions of the learned in the law, are we afraid of not being able to do so, just because, from our youth upwards, our study of the common law has been inadequate?

    <note type="margin" n="262">262</note> " By encouragements of this sort, Crassus, I thoroughly agree with you that the young should be spurred on to severe application: all else that you have brought together from various and dissimilar pursuits and arts, though you yourself have attained everything, I nevertheless regard as lying outside the strict business and function of an orator."

You on the other hand, having enclosed within certain narrow confines the whole function of an orator, will the more easily expound to us the result of your investigations into his duties and rules: but that, I think, must be another time. For our talk to-day has been long enough. <note type="margin" n="265">265</note> Now too Scaevola, as he has arranged to go to his Tusculan villa, will rest awhile, until the heat has abated; and let us ourselves, considering the time of day, take care of our health."
This suggestion pleased everybody. Then Scaevola observed: " I devoutly wish that I had not arranged with Laelius to arrive at my Tusculan villa to-day; I should like to hear Antonius." And, as he got up, he added with a smile: " For I was not so much vexed by his tearing our common law to tatters, as delighted by his admission that he knew nothing about it."

THE MAKING OF AN ORATOR

    <note type="margin">Introduction: eloquence of Crassus and Antonius based on erudition.</note>
    <milestone unit="section" n="1"/>I. When we were boys, brother Quintus, there was, if you remember, a widespread belief that Lucius Crassus had dabbled no further in learning than the early training of a lad of his day allowed, and that Marcus Antonius was absolutely without any education and ignorant. And there were many who, while they did not hold this to be the truth of the matter, none the less hoped the more readily to deter us eager students in search of eloquence from the pursuit of learning, and so they did not scruple to j, J-make such statements about those eminent orators; . to the intent that we ourselves, on seeing that men who were no scholars had attained the highest degree of practical wisdom, and a standard of eloquence passing belief, might come to look upon all our own labour as being but in vain, and to think mere folly the care bestowed upon our education by a man so excellent and widely experienced as our father. <note type="margin" n="2">2</note> Such sophists we used at that time to confound, in boyish fashion, by calling witnesses from home, namely our father, our near kinsman Gaius Aculeo, and our paternal uncle Lucius Cicero, inasmuch as our father, and Aculeo, who married our mother's sister, and was esteemed by Crassus above all other

<p>
    men, and our paternal uncle, who went out to Cilicia with Antonius, and was with him when he left his province for home, all severally and often related to us a great deal about Crassus, his application to study, and his intellectual attainments. And since, in the company of our cousins, the sons of Aculeo and our mother's sister, we were not only studying such subjects as attracted Crassus, but were also being instructed by those very teachers whom he made his friends, we, being as we were at his home, often perceived,—as even we boys could perceive,—that, besides speaking Greek so perfectly as to suggest that it was the only tongue he knew, he propounded such topics to our masters in the way of inquiry and himself so handled matters in his discourse, that nothing seemed strange to him, nothing beyond his range of knowledge. <note type="margin" n="3">3</note> But as for Antonius, although we had frequently understood from our highly accomplished paternal uncle how, at Athens and at Rhodes alike, that orator had devoted himself to conversation with the most learned men, yet I myself, in early life, went as far as the modesty natural to my youth permitted, in questioning him time and again on many subjects. What I am writing will assuredly be no news to you, for I used to tell you even then that the result of many conversations with him on various subjects was to convey to me the impression that there was nothing—at least in any studies about which I could form an opinion— about which he was inexperienced or ignorant.
    <note type="margin" n="4">4</note> There was nevertheless this point of difference between the two men, that Crassus did not so much wish to be thought to have learned nothing, as to have the reputation of looking down upon learning,
</p>


<pb n="201"/>

<p>
and of placing the wisdom of our own fellow-countrymen above that of the Greeks in all departments; while Antonius held that his speeches would be the more acceptable to a nation like ours, if it were thought that he had never engaged in study at all. Thus the one expected to grow in influence by being thought to hold a poor opinion of the Greeks, and the I other by seeming never even to have heard of them. <note type="margin" n="5">5</note> What the value of these opinions was, would clearly not matter now, but it does belong to this treatise which I have in hand, and to this occasion, to insist that noman has ever succeeded in achieving splendour and excellence in oratory, I will not say merely without training in speaking, but without taking all knowledge for his province as well.
    <note type="margin">Oratory must be backed by learning.</note> <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>II. For, while nearly all the other arts can look after themselves, the art of speaking well, that is to say, of speaking with knowledge, skill and elegance, has no delimited territory, within whose borders it is enclosed and confined. All things whatsoever, that can fall under the discussion of human beings, must be aptly dealt with by him who professes to have this power, or he must abandon the name of eloquent. <note type="margin" n="6">6</note> And so on my own part, I admit that, both in our own country and in Greece itself, which has ever held these pursuits in the highest esteem, there have appeared many men of natural parts and great reputation in oratory, without the fullest universal knowledge; yet I maintain that such eloquence as Crassus and Antonius attained could never have been realized without a knowledge of every matter that went to produce that wisdom and that power of oratory which were manifest in those two. <note type="margin" n="7">7</note> And so ' .

    they once had on the subject, my purpose being, in the first place, to dispel that notion, which had always prevailed, that one of them had no great learning and the other none at all; secondly, to preserve in literary form the sentiments concerning eloquence which to my thinking were expressed to perfection by those consummate orators, if in any way I should have succeeded in recapturing and representing their pronouncements; and lastly, I protest, to rescue, as far as possible, from disuse and from silence, the reputation of these men which was already beginning to wane. <note type="margin" n="8">8</note> For could their own writings have made those orators known, perhaps I should have seen smaller need for this work that I have undertaken, but as one of them had written little (at all events little that survived), and had written that little in early life, while the other had left nothing whatever in writing, I thought that it was a tribute due from me to those great intellects, that while all still held them in living memory I should render that memory immortal, if I could. <note type="margin" n="9">9</note> And my hope is so much the greater that I shall establish the case which I am approaching, because I am not treating of the eloquence of Servius Galba or Gaius Carbo, in which case I should be able to invent at pleasure, no one now surviving to contradict me with his reminiscences, but I am publishing what will be criticized by those who have often actually listened to the men of whom I am speaking, in order that I may recommend an illustrious pair to those who have never seen either of them, on the testimony of the recollections of men to whom both those famous orators were personally known, and who themselves are living and still among us.

But you are the last man, my dear and excellent brother, that I should try to instruct by means of a lot of books which you think only crude; for what can be more exact or graceful than your own diction? But whether it be on principle, as you generally affirm, or from modesty and what I may call the diffidence of the well-bred, that you have shrunk from public speaking (as that eminent father of eloquence, Isocrates, has declared to have been the case with himself), or whether, as I myself am wont to say in jesting mood, you thought one declaimer enough in a family, and wellnigh enough in an entire community, still I think that you will not place this essay among that class of writings which may be a fitting object of ridicule, because of the sheer want of good learning in those who have therein discussed the art of speaking. <note type="margin" n="11">11</note> For to my mind nothing has been passed over, in the dialogue between Crassus and Antonius, that anyone would have thought possible to be known and understood by men of the highest ability, the most eager application, the profoundest learning, and the most complete experience,—a point which you will have no trouble in deciding, since you have chosen to master the lore and principles of oratory by your own study, its practice by my assistance.

    the elder suddenly arrived at the house, accompanied by his brother Gaius Julius. On being informed of this, Crassus rose in a state of excitement, and general astonishment prevailed, everyone surmising that the reason for this visit must be something out of the ordinary. <note type="margin" n="13">13</note> After exchanging very cordial greetings with one another, as their practice was, Crassus inquired, " What in the world brings you here? Have you any news? " " None whatever," replied Catulus; " you see the Games are on. Think us impertinent or troublesome, as you please, but the fact is, that on arriving yesterday evening at my Tusculan villa from his own, Caesar told me that he had met Scaevola, who was on his way from this place, and who related to him a marvellous tale, the purport of which was that you, whom all my inducements, so often employed, could never draw into a discussion, had been stating your views on oratory at large, in debate with Antonius, and reasoning as if in the schools, and very much in the Greek mode. <note type="margin" n="14">14</note> And this was how my brother's entreaties prevailed upon me to accompany him hither,—not indeed that I have any particular aversion to playing the part of a listener, but I vow I was afraid that our pushing in might be troublesome to you—; for he explained that, according to Scaevola, a good part of the discourse stood adjourned until to-day. If you think this action of ours impertinent curiosity, you will blame Caesar, if it seems an abuse of friendship, you will blame the pair of us; for our part we are charmed to be here, provided always that our coming in does not happen to be a nuisance."

<p>
to see at my home men who are among my dearest and best friends; yet, to tell the truth, I had rather it had been any other object than the one you mention. For, to speak my mind, I personally have never been so dissatisfied with myself as I was yesterday; indeed it was just good-nature rather than any fault of mine when, in humouring the young, I forgot that I was old, and did a thing which even as a youth I had never done, in discussing subjects that involved a certain degree of learning. One circumstance however has turned out most happily for me, in that my part is already played out, so Antonius is the one you have come to hear."
    <note type="margin" n="16">16</note> " For my part, Crassus," returned Caesar, " while I am longing to hear you in that fuller and uninterrupted style of debate, yet, if that is not to be had, I could even make shift with your everyday talk. One thing therefore I shall certainly attempt, which is to prevent people from supposing that either my friend Sulpicius or Cotta has more influence with you than I have, and assuredly I shall implore you to spare a little of your amiability even for Catulus and myself. If however that suggestion does not commend itself to you, I shall not press you, nor give you occasion to deem me tactless, while dreading any tactlessness on your own part."
    <note type="margin" n="17">17</note> " Truly, Caesar," rejoined the other, " I have always thought that, of all the words in the Latin language, none has so wide a signification as this word that you have just used. Of course the man whom we call ' tactless ' seems to me to bear a title derived from his want of tact, and this is most amply illustrated in our ordinary conversation, inasmuch as whosoever fails to realize the demands of the occa-

But, of all the countless forms assumed by want of tact, I rather think that the grossest is the Greeks' habit, in any place and any company they like, of plunging into the most subtle dialectic concerning subjects that present extreme difficulty, or at any rate do not call for discussion. This is what we were obliged to do yesterday by our young friends here, albeit we yielded but reluctantly and under protest."

Thereupon Catulus observed, " But even among the Greeks, Crassus, those who were famous and great men in their respective communities, as in our own republic you are, and we all hope to be, were wholly unlike these Greeks, who obtrude themselves upon our hearing; and yet in their hours of ease they were not averse to discussion and debate of this kind. <note type="margin" n="20">20</note> And, although you are justified in deeming those people tactless, who take no heed of seasons, places orpersons,yet do you really think this scene ill-fitting, where this very colonnade, in which we are now walking, this exercise-ground, and these benches placed at so many points, in some degree awaken memories of the gymnastic schools<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a Originally designed for physical exercise, the gymnasia had become the scene of lectures on philosophy.</note> and the discussions of the Greeks?

"
    <note type="margin" n="21">21</note> " Everything that you urge," said Crassus, " I look at in a different light, since in the first place, Catulus, it is my belief that even the Greeks themselves devised their exercise-ground, benches and colonnades, for purposes of physical training and enjoyment, not for dialectic. For not only were their gymnastic schools introduced ages before the philosophers began to chatter therein, but even in the present day, although the sages may be in occupation of all the gymnastic schools, yet their audiences would rather listen to the discus than to the Master, and the moment its clink is heard, they all desert the lecturer, in the middle of an oration upon the most sublime and weighty topics, in order to anoint<note type="footnote" n="b" place="opposite">b Unctionis causa refers to the wrestler's use of suppling-oil in preparation for the palaestra.</note> themselves for athletic exercise; so definitely do they place the most trifling amusement before that which the philosophers describe as the most solid advantage. <note type="margin" n="22">22</note> And, as to your saying that it is a holiday, I agree with you; but the enjoyment of a holiday is not mental effort, but relaxation.

" Often have I heard my father-in-law say that his own father-in-law Laelius almost invariably had Scipio with him upon his country excursions, and that the pair of them used to become boys again, in an astonishing degree, as soon as ever they had flitted from the prison of town to rural scenes. I am afraid to say it of personages so august, but Scaevola is fond of relating how at Caieta and Laurentum it was their wont to collect mussels and top-shells, and to condescend to every form of mental recreation and

' And I added also the proposition, ' For to my mind he is no free man, who is not sometimes doing nothing.' To that view, Catulus, I still adhere, and it is just this inaction and utter idleness that charm me on my comings to this place.

" Truly, Catulus," answered Caesar, " I think already that I have bestowed my pains to advantage in coming hither, for to myself at any rate this very protest against discussion has been in itself a discussion of a most agreeable character. But why are we delaying Antonius, whose function, I hear, is to treat of eloquence at large, and for whom Cotta has been a long time waiting, and so has Sulpicius? " <note type="margin" n="27">27</note> " Nay," interposed Crassus, " I will not have Antonius utter a syllable, and I will myself be dumb, until I have first obtained a boon from you." " Name it," said Catulus. " That you spend the day here." Then, as the other hesitated, because he had promised to go to his brother's, Julius observed, " I answer for both of us. We will do as you ask, and on the terms you offer, you would keep me here, even though you should not contribute a word to the debate."
    <note type="margin" n="28">28</note> Here Catulus smiled on him and said, " There's an end of my hesitation anyhow, since I had given no orders at home, and my brother here, at whose house I was to have been, has so readily engaged me, without my having any say in the matter." At this point all eyes were turned on Antonius,

    who exclaimed, " Attention, pray! Attention! For you will be listening to a man from the schools, polished by professorial instruction and the study of Greek literature; and I shall speak with all the fuller assurance, in that Catulus has joined my audience, he whose possession of accuracy and taste in the Greek language is ever acknowledged, not only by us men of Latin speech, but by the Greeks themselves as well. <note type="margin" n="29">29</note> Seeing however that all this art or vocation of speaking, whichever it may be, can avail nothing without the addition of ' cheek,' I will teach you, my disciples, something that I have not learned myself, to wit, my theory of oratory in all its branches."
    <note type="margin" n="30">30</note> <note type="margin">Oratory not a science;</note> When their laughter had subsided, he continued, " Oratory, it seems to me, derives distinction from a science' ability,<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a Facultate. Similarly Aristotle describes rhetoric as a δύναμις, not a τέχνη (Rhet. I. ii. 1).</note> but owes little to art. For, while art is concerned with the things that are known, the activity of the orator has to do with opinion, not knowledge. For we both address ourselves to the ignorant, and speak of matters unknown to ourselves, with the result, that while our hearers form different conceptions and judgements at different times, concerning the selfsame subjects, we on our part often take opposite sides, not merely in the sense that Crassus sometimes argues against me, or I against him, when one or the other of us must of necessity be urging what is false, but also because we both maintain different opinions at different times on an identical issue, in which case only one of such opinions can possibly be right. I shall therefore speak as one who is dealing with a subject which is founded upon falsehood, which seldom attains to demonstration, which sets its snares to entrap the fancies and often the

    case, rather than from any supposed grandeur of your theme." <note type="margin" n="32">32</note> " Well then," resumed Antonius, " while I have admitted, on the general question, that oratory is not the highest form of art, I yet make this assertion—that some very clever rules may be laid down for playing upon men's feelings and making; prize of their goodwill. If anyone is for claiming that the knowledge of such devices is an art of real significance, I am not going to quarrel with him. For, inasmuch as very many advocates argue their cases in Court carelessly and without method, while some others, thanks to training or to a certain amount of experience, do such work more skilfully, it is indisputable that any man who applied his mind to finding out the reason why some speak better than others, may succeed in discerning it. <note type="margin" n="33">33</note> Whence it follows, that he who extends his survey over the whole province of rhetoric, will discover that which, though not absolutely an art, yet wears the likeness of an art.
    " And I would that, even as I think I see, with the mind's eye, the course of proceedings in the Courts, and at the hearing of actions, so I could now go on to bring these before you as they really are!

one of the arts, still there is nothing more splendid than a complete orator. For to pass over the actual practice of eloquence—that governing force in every tranquil and free community—, there is such a charm about the mere power to deliver a set speech, that no impression more delightful than this can be received by the ear or the intelligence of man. <note type="margin" n="34">34</note> Can any music be composed that is sweeter than a well-balanced speech? Is any poem better rounded than an artistic period in prose? What actor gives keener pleasure by his imitation of real life than your orator affords in his conduct of some real case? Does anything display more exact precision than a rapid succession of pointed reflections? Is there aught more wonderful than the lighting-up of a topic by verbal brilliance, or aught richer than a discourse furnished forth with material of every sort? And there is not a subject that is not the orator's own, provided only that it is one which deserves elegant and impressive treatment.

" It is the part of the orator, when advising on affairs of supreme importance, to unfold his opinion as a man having authority: his duty too it is to arouse a listless nation, and to curb its unbridled impetuosity. By one and the same power of eloquence the deceitful among mankind are brought to destruction, and the righteous to deliverance. Who more passionately than the orator can encourage to virtuous conduct, or more zealously than he reclaim from vicious courses Who can more austerely censure the wicked, or more gracefully praise men of worth?

For if there be any other art, which pretends to skill in the coinage and choice of language, or if it be claimed for anyone but the orator that he gives shape and variety to a speech, and marks it out with<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a Insignia are the ' purple patches ' of Horace, A.P. 15-16.</note> high lights of thought and phrase, or if any method be taught, except by this single art, for producing proofs or reflections, or even in the distribution and arrangement of subject-matter, then let us admit that the skill professed by this art of ours either belongs really to some other art, or is shared in common with some other. <note type="margin" n="37">37</note> Whereas, if all reasoning and all teaching really belong to this one art alone, then, even though professors of other arts have expressed themselves with success, it does not therefore follow that such instruction is not the monopoly of this single art; but (as Crassus was saying yesterday) just as the orator is best qualified to discuss the subjects pertaining to the other arts, assuming always that he has acquainted himself with them, so the masters of the other arts expound their own topics with the better grace, if they have learned something from the art with which we are dealing. <note type="margin" n="38">38</note> For even though some farmer may have written or spoken with address upon country matters or perhaps a medical man upon pathology, as many have done, or a painter upon painting, it does not therefore follow that eloquence belongs to the particular art, the truth being that in the art of speaking, by reason of the vast energy inherent in human intelli-

gence, many a man, whatever his class or his calling, attains some degree of proficiency even without any regular training. But, although the peculiar property of each art may be determined by noting what it is which each teaches, there can be nothing more certain than this, that while all other arts are able to discharge their functions unaided by eloquence, the orator cannot even earn his distinctive title without being eloquent; so that the rest of the world, if they be fluent speakers, gain something from him, while he, unless he has equipped himself from his own private store, cannot seek his supplies as a speaker from any other source."

And yet, to be sure, a man of eloquence must needs sing the praises of eloquence better than all others, since he is bound to bring, to the performance of his task, that very gift which he is praising. But pray proceed, for I agree with you that you have this skill in speaking wholly for your own, and that any man discoursing with ability upon any other art does but use an accomplishment borrowed from elsewhere, and one that is not peculiar to himself, or even his own." <note type="margin" n="40">40</note> And Crassus added, " A night's rest has smoothed and humanized you, Antonius, from our point of view, for in the course of yesterday's discussion you sketched the orator as a one-talent man, ' Just a galley-slave or porter,' to

    " I did," returned Antonius, " for yesterday it was my design, if I should have succeeded in refuting your arguments, to steal these pupils from you; but to-day, with Catulus and Caesar among my hearers, I think it my duty not so much to fight with you as to enunciate my own personal views. <note type="margin" n="41">41</note> <note type="margin">The proper sphere of rhetoric.</note> And so, now that we are to have this orator, whom we are discussing, brought into Court and exposed to public scrutiny, our next task is to consider what business we shall assign to him, and what function we would suggest that he has been appointed to discharge. For yesterday, Catulus and Caesar, when you were not here, Crassus made in concise terms, with regard to the classification of this art, the identical statement that most of the Greeks have made, and of course expressed no opinion of his own, but just their affirmations: his proposition being that there are two main divisions of the questions wherewith eloquence is concerned, the one abstract, the other concrete. <note type="margin" n="42">42</note> By abstract problems I thought he meant those wherein questions are propounded in general terms, as for instance, ' Is eloquence to be desired? ' ' Should public office be sought? ' The concrete class, by contrast, was composed of such as raise investigations dealing with individual persons and settled and defined points, to which kind belong the issues discussed in Court, and in the judicial proceedings and the disputes between private citizens. <note type="margin" n="43">43</note> The sphere of such oratory is limited, in my view, to the conduct of litigation and to advising, for that third category, just barely noticed by Crassus, and included, as I am told, by Aristotle<note type="footnote" n="b" place="opposite">b Rhet.

" Precisely so," replied Antonius, " and, with regard to this type of oratory, I know that I myself, and all who were present, were highly delighted when your mother Popilia was eulogized in this fashion by yourself; she being, I think, the first woman to whom such honour was ever rendered in our own community. But to my mind not everything that we say need be reduced to theory and rule. <note type="margin" n="45">45</note> For from those same sources, whence the rules of speaking are all derived, we shall also be able to set off a funeral oration without feeling the want of those scholastic rudiments, since, even though no one were to teach these, is there a man who would not know the good points of a human being? In fact, if he has laid down those axioms enunciated by Crassus in the opening of that famous speech of his, which he delivered when censor in opposition to his colleague in office, when he declared, that while he could cheerfully endure inferiority in respect of the gifts bestowed on mankind by nature or by chance, he could not consent to be surpassed in such credit as men may win for themselves, he who proposes to be the panegyrist of anyone will understand that he has in the first place to deal fully with the favours of fortune. <note type="margin" n="46">46</note> These are the advantages of race, wealth, connexions, friendships, power, good health, beauty, vigour, talent, and the rest of the attributes that are either physical or externally imposed: it must be explained that the person commended made a right use of these benefits if he possessed them, managed sensibly

These and similar indications of character the would-be panegyrist will readily discern, and he who seeks to disparage will as readily find evidence in rebuttal."
    <note type="margin" n="47">47</note> " Why then hesitate," interposed Catulus, " to regard this as a third kind, since its existence is inherent in the nature of the case? For the fact of its being easier of accomplishment is no reason for eliminating it from the classification." " My reason," replied the other, " is that I do not wish to handle all matters, however petty, that at one time or another fall under oratorical treatment, upon the footing that nothing can be mentioned without reference to its own special rules. <note type="margin" n="48">48</note> For instance, evidence has often to be given, and, upon occasions, with precision even closer than usual, as I myself was compelled to give it against Sextus Titius, a factious and troublesome member of the community.

I was long obstructed, had to listen to a great deal, and replied to many objections. But do you on that account think it fitting, when laying down rules of rhetoric, to add any teaching on how to give evidence, as though this came within the

Because, on occasions of this sort, a style of diction more elaborate than the ordinary has to be employed, does it therefore seem to follow that this type of speaking should be accounted a distinct department of oratorical activity, or should be fitted out with its own peculiar rules? " " Why of course not," returned Catulus, " since the ability acquired by a ready speaker, from the treatment of his other subjects and topics, will not fail him in situations of that description."
    <note type="margin" n="50">50</note> "And so," continued Antonius, "those matters which often demand fluent expression, and which just now, in my praise of eloquence, I asserted to be within the part of the orator, have no special place in the formal classification of the branches of rhetoric, nor any particular code of rules, and yet they must be handled quite as skilfully as arguments at the Bar: I am speaking of rebuke, encouragement, and the giving of comfort, each of which topics calls for the finest graces of diction, while such subjects ask no directions from theory."

" But nevertheless," rejoined Antonius, " (and I say this, that you may not think lightly of our own folk) the Greeks themselves also used to write, in the beginning, just like our Cato, Pictor and Piso. <note type="margin" n="52">52</note> For history began as a mere compilation of annals, on which account, and in order to preserve the general traditions, from the earliest period of the City down to the pontificate of Publius Mucius, each High Priest used to commit to writing all the events of his year of office, and record them on a white surface, and post up the tablet at his house, that all men might have liberty to acquaint themselves therewith, and to this day those records are known as the Pontifical Chronicles. <note type="margin" n="53">53</note> A similar style of writing has been adopted by many who, without any rhetorical ornament, have left behind them bare records of dates, personalities, places and events. In this sense Pherecydes, Hellanicus, Acusilas, and very many others among the Greeks, correspond to our own Cato, Pictor and Piso, who do not understand the adornment of composition—since it is only of late that decoration of that sort has been brought into this country—and, so long as their narrative is understood, regard conciseness as the historian's single merit. <note type="margin" n="54">54</note> Antipater, an admirable man and a close friend of Crassus, raised his crest a little higher, and imparted to history a richer tone: the rest did not embellish their facts, but were chroniclers and nothing more."

For not one of our own folk seeks after eloquence, save with an eye to its display at the Bar and in public speaking, whereas in Greece the most eloquent were strangers to forensic advocacy, and applied themselves chiefly to reputable studies in general, and particularly to writing history. Indeed even of renowned Herodotus, who first imparted distinction to such work, we have heard that he was in no way concerned with lawsuits, and yet his eloquence is of such quality as to afford intense pleasure, to myself at any rate, so far as I can comprehend what is written in Greek. <note type="margin" n="56">56</note> After his day Thucydides, in my judgement, easily surpassed all others in dexterity of composition: so abounding is he in fullness of material that in the number of his ideas he well-nigh equals the number of his words, and furthermore he is so exact and clear in expression that you cannot tell whether it be the narrative that gains illumination from the style, or the diction from the thought. Yet even of him, though a man of public affairs, we are not told that he was numbered among forensic speakers; and it is related that when writing the volumes in question, he was far away from civic life, having in fact been driven into exile, as generally happened at Athens to anyone of excellence. <note type="margin" n="57">57</note> He was succeeded by Philistus of Syracuse, who, living in the closest intimacy with the tyrant Dionysius, spent his leisure in writing history and, to my

" And at length historians appeared who had begun as philosophers, first Xenophon, that notable follower of Socrates, afterwards Callisthenes, Aristotle's disciple and Alexander's familiar friend; the latter approaching the rhetorical in method, while his predecessor adopted a gentler kind of tone, lacking the characteristic vigour of oratory and possibly less animated but, in my view at any rate, somewhat more pleasing. Timaeus, the latest-born of all these, but as well as I can judge, by far the best informed, the most amply endowed in wealth of material and range of thought, and a man whose very style had some polish, brought to authorship abounding eloquence but no experience of public speaking."

Your poets, speaking as they do an altogether different tongue, I do not attempt to handle at all: I divert myself (as I said) in the company of those who have written the story of events, or speeches delivered by themselves, or whose style suggests their wish to be accessible to us men of no very profound learning.

Nor of malice? <note type="margin" n="63">63</note> This groundwork of course is familiar to every one; the completed structure however rests upon the story and the diction. The nature of the subject needs chronological arrangement and geographical representation: and since, in reading of important affairs worth recording, the plans of campaign, the executive actions and the results are successively looked for, it calls also, as regards such plans, for some intimation of what the writer approves, and, in the narrative of achievement, not only for a statement of what was done or said, but also of the manner of doing or saying it; and, in the estimate of consequences, for an exposition of all contributory causes, whether originating in accident, discretion or foolhardiness; and, as for the individual actors, besides an account of their exploits, it demands particulars of the lives and characters of such as are outstanding in renown and dignity. <note type="margin" n="64">64</note> Then again the kind of language and type of style to be followed are the easy and the flowing, which run their course with unvarying current and a certain placidity, avoiding alike the rough speech we use in Court and the advocate's stinging epigrams.

<p>
    there lies a boundless forest of topics: because (as Crassus too has shown) most writers have assigned to the orator two kinds of subject to talk upon, the one concerned with what is specific and determinate, such as the matters handled in lawsuits and consultations,—to which he who will may add panegyrics—; the other spoken of by nearly every writer,—though explained by none—, as the abstract sort of inquiry, unrelated to times or persons. <note type="margin" n="66">66</note> When discussing this kind they do not seem to me to grasp its nature and range. For if it be an orator's part to be able to speak on any subject whatever that is laid before him in general terms, he will have to discuss the size of the sun and the contour of the earth; and after undertaking this duty he will not be able to refuse to handle mathematics or the cult of the Muses. In a word, for the man who claims the right to speak, not only on problems identified with specific times and persons (that is, on all judicial issues), but also on propositions of an abstract character, there can be no sort of debate which he can decline.

But please see that you do not include the water-serpent and wild beast's skin in your two kinds, and leave the ' Hercules ' and other more important work among the things you pass over.

Then, when the other listeners, vastly delighted, asked Hannibal for his opinion of the eminent teacher, the Carthaginian is reported to have thereupon replied, in no very good Greek, but at any rate candidly, that time and again he had seen many old madmen but never one madder than Phormio. <note type="margin" n="76">76</note> And upon my word he was right, for what better example of prating insolence could there be than for a Greek, who had never seen a foeman or a camp, or even had the slightest connexion with any public employment, to lecture on military matters to Hannibal, who all those years had been disputing empire with the Roman people, the conquerors of the world? Just so do all those seem to me to behave who lay down rule for the art of speaking, for they are for teaching others a thing with which they themselves are unacquainted. But possibly their blunder is the less serious, in that they do not try to instruct yourself, as Phormio did Hannibal, but only boys or very young men."

Is there in fact a man among those Greeks who would credit one of us with understanding anything? Not that they worry me so much; I gladly suffer and bear with them all. For they either contribute to my amusement, or contrive to soften my regret at not having been a student. And I send them on their ways less contemptuously than Hannibal sent his philosopher, and for that reason perhaps I have even more trouble with them; their theory however, so far as I can judge, is utterly ludicrous. <note type="margin" n="78">78</note> For they divide the whole subject into two branches—the discussion of concrete and of abstract problems.

    I see in an outstanding orator who is also a man of worth. But if he seems likely, after doing his utmost in every way, to attain only the level of the ordinary speaker, I will leave him to his own choice and not worry him much, while, if he prove wholly unsuitable and out of his element, I will recommend either self-repression or recourse to some other vocation. <note type="margin" n="86">86</note> For by no means must a man of the highest capacity be left without our encouragement, or one of any ability scared away, since to my mind the state of the former partakes in a sense of the godlike, while the other course, that of refraining from doing what you cannot do perfectly, or doing what you can do without complete discredit, is natural to a gentleman. But that third alternative of bawling, in defiance of propriety and of the speaker's own limitations, marks the man who, as you, Catulus, observed of a certain bawler, assembles as many witnesses of his folly as he can, by acting as his own crier. <note type="margin" n="87">87</note> Of him then, who shall be found deserving of our encouragement and help, let us so speak as to impart to him merely what practice has taught us, so that under our leadership he may reach that stage at which we ourselves have arrived without a leader, since better teaching we cannot give.

Scarcely a year had elapsed, after this advisory talk with me, when our friend prosecuted Gaius Norbanus,<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a See § 197 n.</note> whom I was defending. Incredible was the difference I saw between the Sulpicius of that day and of a year earlier. Assuredly Nature herself was leading him into the grand and glorious style of Crassus, but could never have made him proficient enough, had he not pressed forward on that same way by careful imitation, and formed the habit of speaking with every thought and all his soul fixed in contemplation of Crassus.

Moreover, if there is a fault, it is not much trouble to appropriate that and to copy it ostentatiously, just as that Fufius, who even now is raving in the political world, though his voice has gone, fails to attain the energy in speaking which Gaius Fimbria certainly possessed, though hitting off his uncouth mouthings and broad pronunciation.

" And indeed the former sort, men like Theopompus, Ephorus, Philistus, Naucrates and many more, while differing in natural gifts, yet in spirit resemble one another and their Master too; and those who betook themselves to lawsuits, as did Demosthenes, Hyperides, Lycurgus, Aeschines, Dinarchus and several others, although of varying degrees of ability, were none the less all busy with the same type of imitation of real life, and as long as the imitation of these persisted, so long did their kind of oratory and course of training endure. <note type="margin" n="95">95</note> Afterwards, when these men were dead and all remembrance of them gradually grew dim and then vanished away, certain other less spirited and lazier styles of speaking flourished. Then came Demochares, said to have been the son of Demosthenes' sister, and after him the distinguished Demetrius of Phalerum, the most elegant, to my thinking, of all that school, and others like them. And, if we please to trace this subject down to our own times, we shall find, that just as to-day all Asia is copying the great Menecles of Alabanda and his brother Hierocles, both of whom I have heard, so there has always been some speaker whom the majority would fain resemble. <note type="margin" n="96">96</note> Let him then, who hopes by imitation to attain this likeness, carry out his purpose by frequent and large practice, and if possible, by written composition: if our friend Sulpicius here were to do so, his diction would be far more condensed; at present, as countrymen are

Curio too, your contemporary, whose father I consider quite the most eloquent of his day, seems to me to copy no one in particular, though in the dignity, refinement and copiousness of his language he has given expression to what may be called his own peculiar pattern and type of oratory, of which I could judge to perfection in that action which he conducted against me before the Hundred Commissioners, on behalf of the brothers Cossi; on that occasion he lacked no qualification which an orator of insight, not of copiousness alone, should possess.

But in the law-courts documents, evidence, informal agreements, formal contracts, relationship by blood or marriage, magisterial orders, opinions of counsel, and finally the life-history of the parties to the proceedings, must all be examined; and we see that it is generally through neglect of these matters that cases are lost, particularly such as concern private rights, for these are often of peculiar difficulty. <note type="margin" n="101">101</note> Thus some practitioners, wishing their business to be thought large, and themselves to be seen flitting from lawsuit to lawsuit all round the courts, argue cases which they have not got up.

For, in the first place, if the addition or substraction of a word be seized on, a definition is often wrung from our grasp, and then too the very suggestion savours of the schools and a training little better than elementary, and lastly the definition cannot reach the understanding and reason of the arbitrator, as it slips by him before he has taken it in.

"But in that kind of cases, wherein the nature of something is in issue, a further contest often arises out of the construction of a document, when the only possible dispute comes from an equivocation. For the mere fact that letter and spirit are at variance involves something of an equivocation; and this is solved directly the missing words are supplied, and, when these are inserted, it is contended that the sense of the writing has become plain. And, if uncertainty arises from passages which contradict one another, there emerges no new sort of problem, but a double example of the former kind. And this will either prove insoluble, or will be so solved, that by the restoration of the words omitted, whichever version we are upholding will be completed.

And indeed those professors, after distinguishing a larger number of types of cases, suggest proofs in plenty for each type. But, even if this plan is better fitted for training the young, to the end that, directly a case is propounded, they may have authorities from which they can forthwith borrow ready-made proofs, yet it is a symptom of congenital dullness to follow up the tiny rills, but fail to discern the sources of things: and by this time it is the privilege of men of our years and experience to call up what we want from the water's head, and to discern the springs of every stream.

Thus, while in our cases we have these two objectives, first what to say, and secondly how to say it, the former, which seems to be art pure and simple, cannot indeed dispense with art, though it needs but ordinary skill to discover what ought to be said; but it is in the latter that the orator's godlike power and excellence are discerned, that is, his delivery of what he has to say in a style elegant, copious and diversified.

For just as, whenever we have some word to write, we need not search out its component letters by hard thinking, so, whenever we have some case to argue, our right course is not to fall back upon proofs laid away for that particular type of cases, but to have in readiness sundry commonplaces which will instantly present themselves for setting forth the case, as the letters do for writing the word. <note type="margin" n="131">131</note> But these commonplaces can be useful only to a speaker who is a man of affairs, qualified by experience, which age assuredly

' Opimius killed Gracchus. What is the substance of the case? That he did so in the interest of the community, after proclaiming a state of war in obedience to the Senate's decree. Strike out this plea, and there will be no case. Decius however denies the legality of the decree itself, as being contrary to statute.

For in their division of the different kinds of speeches they set up two sorts of cases: one they describe as raising general questions, not related to individuals or occasions; and the other as depending upon specific individuals and occasions; not knowing that any debate whatsoever can be brought under the notion and quality of the general kind. <note type="margin" n="134">134</note> For, in the very case I mentioned just now, the personality of Opimius or of Decius has nothing to do with the orator's commonplaces. There is an abstract question of a purely general kind, ' Is a defendant to be deemed deserving of punishment, who has slain a fellow-countryman in obedience to a decree of the Senate, and for the salvation of his native land, though by statute such act was unlawful? ' There is in fact no case wherein the issue for decision turns on the personalities of the parties, and not on the abstract discussion of general conceptions. <note type="margin" n="135">135</note> Indeed, even where the question is one of pure fact, such as ' Did Publius Decius take moneys unlawfully?' the evidence for prosecution and defence alike must have reference to general terms and essential qualities: to convict of extravagance you must refer to profusion; of covetousness, to greed; of sedition, to turbulent and wicked members of

    the Case of Mancinus<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a See Book I, xl.</note> to Mancinus alone, then every time the surrender of anyone delivered up by the Priestly Envoy has been rejected, a fresh debate will begin. But, if the substance of that case is the problem ' Whether a man delivered up by the Priestly Envoy has the right of re-entry if his surrender is rejected,' then the person of Mancinus has nothing to do with the art of speaking or the evidence for the defence. <note type="margin" n="138">138</note> Moreover whatever help a man's worth or his want of it affords is irrelevant to the inquiry, and yet that part of the speech also must be classed as discussion of a general proposition.

This however is nothing to me, for we are not obliged to quarrel with those people. It is quite enough to make it known that they have not even succeeded in distinguishing different classes of things, and in describing them a little more accurately, as with their unbounded leisure they could have done, even though they lacked our own public practice. <note type="margin" n="140">140</note> But this, as I said, is nothing to me. What is important to me, and far more so to you, friends Cotta and Sulpicius, is that, in the present stage of those men's attainments, a multiplicity of cases is greatly to be feared; for their variety is endless if they are identified with individuals; every man then has his case; but, if they are brought under general heads of inquiry, they are so ordinary and so few that careful and thoughtful speakers with good memories should be able to handle them all, after mentally running through them and all but singsonging them; unless you happen to think that Lucius Crassus got up his brief from Manius Curius,<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a See Book I, § 180.</note> and for that reason adduced all those grounds for holding Curius entitled to succeed as heir to Coponius, though no posthumous son had been born. <note type="margin" n="141">141</note> The identity of Coponius or of Curius had nothing to do with the wealth of argument or with the essential character of the case. The whole inquiry turned upon an abstract question, founded in the facts of the matter, not in any occasion or personalities: the words in the will being ' If a son is born to me, and such son dies before, etc., then let So-and-so be my heir,' and no son having in fact been born, ought that party to inherit who was nominated

For I observe that in the treatises of Cato and Brutus the advice given by counsel to clients of either sex is generally set down with the parties named: I suppose, to make us think that some reason for seeking advice or for the discussion originated in the parties and not in the circumstances; to the end that, seeing the parties to be innumerable, we might be discouraged from studying the law, and might cast away our inclination to learn at the same moment as our hope of mastery. But these matters Crassus will one day disentangle for us and set forth arranged under heads; for you must know, Catulus, that yesterday he promised us that he would collect under definite heads the common law, at present dispersed in disorder, and would reduce it to an easy system."
    <note type="margin" n="143">143</note> " To be sure," answered Catulus, " that is easy enough for Crassus, who has learned all there is to be learned about law, and will personally supply the deficiencies of his teachers, to make it possible for him to arrange fittingly and elucidate elegantly the contents of the law."

" Upon my word, Crassus," interposed Antonius, " if Catulus has been telling the truth, you and I will have to pass our fives together in the same pounding-mill; and we shall let leisure have (—and welcome too) that yawning and drowsy philosophizing of men like Scaevola and the others who are lucky." <note type="margin" n="145">145</note> Crassus laughed quietly at this, observing, " Just weave out the warp you have begun, Antonius, but that yawning Philosophy of yours, when once I have found sanctuary with her, will claim my freedom."

" And so, since in oratory three things are necessary to discovery of arguments, first acuteness, secondly theory, or art, as we may call it if we like, and thirdly painstaking, I must needs grant pride of place to talent, though talent itself is roused from lethargy by painstaking, <note type="margin" n="148">148</note> painstaking, I repeat, which is always valuable, and most of all in fighting a case. This virtue we must especially cultivate and ever be calling it to our aid; there is nothing that this cannot attain. By painstaking comes that intimate knowledge of a case, to which I alluded at first; it is painstaking to listen with close attention to our opponent, and so as to catch not only his periods, but his every word as well, and finally to read all his changes of countenance, which generally gives the clue to his frame of mind. <note type="margin" n="149">149</note> But to do this unobtrusively, so that he may not think he has scored a point, is discretion.

And at the same time I considered that, with the Greeks undertaking, professing and achieving such marvels, and promising to reveal to mankind the way to understand the profoundest mysteries, to live rightly and to speak copiously, it would be brutish and inhuman not to lend an ear, and, though perhaps not venturing to listen to them openly, for fear of lessening your influence with your fellow-citizens, yet to pick up their sayings by eavesdropping, and keep a look-out from afar for their talk.

    of distinguishing truth from error, which art he called by the Greek name of dialectic? This art, if indeed it be an art, contains no directions for discovering truth, but only for testing it. <note type="margin" n="158">158</note> For as to every proposition that we enunciate with an affirmation of its truth or falsity, if it be affirmed without qualification, the dialecticians undertake to decide

    whether it be true or false; and, if again it be stated hypothetically, with collateral propositions annexed, then they decide whether these others are properly annexed, and whether the conclusion drawn from each and every reasoning is correct: and in the end they prick themselves with their own barbs, and by wide investigation discover not only difficulties such as they themselves can no longer solve, but also others by which webs already attacked, or rather well-nigh unwound, are tangled up again. <note type="margin" n="159">159</note> In this connexion then that eminent Stoic is of no help to us, since he does not teach me how to discover what to say; and he actually hinders me, by finding many difficulties which he pronounces quite insoluble, and by introducing a kind of diction that is not lucid, copious and flowing, but meagre, spiritless, cramped and paltry; and, if any man commends this style, it will only be with the qualification that it is unsuitable to an orator. For this oratory of ours must be adapted to the ears of the multitude, for charming or urging their minds to approve of proposals, which are weighed in no goldsmith's balance, but in what I may call common scales.

    gentle language, and the faculty of seeming to be dealing reluctantly and under compulsion with something you are really anxious to prove. It is very helpful to display the tokens of good-nature, kindness, calmness, loyalty and a disposition that is pleasing and not grasping or covetous, and all the qualities belonging to men who are upright, unassuming and not given to haste, stubbornness, strife or harshness, are powerful in winning goodwill, while the want of them estranges it from such as do not possess them; accordingly the very opposites of these qualities must be ascribed to our opponents. <note type="margin" n="183">183</note> But all this kind of advocacy will be best in those cases wherein the arbitrator's feelings are not likely to be kindled by what I may call the ardent and impassioned onset. For vigorous language is not always wanted, but often such as is calm, gentle, mild: this is the kind that most commends the parties. By' parties ' I mean not only persons impeached, but all whose interests are being determined, for that was how people used the term in the old days. <note type="margin" n="184">184</note> And so to paint their characters in words, as being upright, stainless, conscientious, modest and long-suffering under injustice, has a really wonderful effect; and this topic, whether in opening, or in stating the case, or in winding-up, is so compelling, when agreeably and feelingly handled, as often to be worth more than the merits of the case. Moreover so much is done by good taste and style in speaking, that the speech seems to depict the speaker's character. For by means of particular types of thought and diction, and the employment besides of a delivery that is unruffled and eloquent of good-nature, the speakers are made to appear upright, well-bred and virtuous men.

Being subsequently prosecuted and condemned for his treason and embezzlement in Gaul, he was exiled.

For all the advantages in that case had been yours: you were citing to the Court the violence, the flight, the stone-throwing and the tribunes' ruthlessness that marked the disastrous and lamentable affair of Caepio; then too it was established that Marcus Aemilius, chief of Senate and chief of State, had been struck by a stone, while it was undeniable that Lucius Cotta and Titus Didius, on trying to veto a resolution, had been forcibly driven from sanctuary.

Next I discussed the considerations lately recalled by Crassus; how that neither the expulsion of kings from this State, nor the establishment of tribunes of the commons, nor the frequent restriction of the consuls' power by decrees of the commons, nor the bestowal upon the Roman People of the right of appeal, that famous buttress of the State and defence of freedom, could any of them have been effected without aristocratic opposition; and that, if those particular civil discords had been beneficial to our community, the mere fact of a popular movement having been caused must not instantly be counted against Gaius Norbanus for heinous wickedness and indeed a capital offence. That if rightfulness had ever been conceded to an incitement of the Roman People to sedition,—a concession which I was showing to have been frequent—, there had never been a juster cause than this one. After that I altered my course and turned my entire speech into a denunciation of the running-away of Caepio and a lament for the destruction of his army: in this way, besides chafing anew by my words the sores of people mourning for their own folk, I was kindling the feelings of the Roman Knights, who constituted the Court I was addressing, into fresh

Thus all through that speech for the defence, and indeed the trial itself, it was in the fewest possible words that I glanced over and lightly touched the matters which seemed dependent upon scientific treatment, I mean my discussion of the Statute of Appuleius,<note type="footnote" n="b" place="opposite">b See Book II, § 107 n. b.</note> and my exposition of the nature of treason.

struggle to reveal the presence, in the cause you are upholding, of some merit or usefulness, and to make it plain that the man, for whom you are to win this love, in no respect consulted his own interests and did nothing at all from personal motives. For men's private gains breed jealousy, while their zeal for others' service is applauded.
    <note type="margin" n="208">208</note> " And here we must be watchful, not to seem to extol unduly the merits and renown—jealousy's favourite target—of those whom we would have beloved for their good works. Then too, from these same commonplaces, we shall learn as well to instigate hatred of others as to turn it away from ourselves and our clients: and these same general heads are to be employed in kindling and also in assuaging wrath. For, if you glorify the doing of something ruinous or unprofitable to your particular audience, hate is engendered: while, if it be something done against good men in general, or those to whom the particular doer should never have done it, or against the State, no such bitter hate is excited, but a disgust closely resembling ill-will or hate. <note type="margin" n="209">209</note> Fear again is struck from either the perils of individuals or those shared by all: that of private origin goes deeper, but universal fear also is to be traced to a similar source.

For from that mildness, which wins us the goodwill of our hearers, some inflow must reach this fiercest of passions, wherewith we inflame the same people, and again, out of this passion some little energy must often be kindled within that mildness: nor is any style better blended than that wherein the harshness of strife is tempered by the personal urbanity of the advocate, while his easy-going mildness is fortified by some admixture of serious strife.
    <note type="margin" n="213">213</note> " Now in both styles of speaking, the one demanding passion and strife, and the other adapted to recommendation of the speaker's life and manners, the opening of a speech is unhurried, and none the less its closing should also be fingering and long drawn-out. For you must not bound all of a sudden into that emotional style, since it is wholly alien to the merits of the case, and people long to hear first just what is peculiarly within their own cognizance, while, once you have assumed that style, you must not be in a hurry to change it. <note type="margin" n="214">214</note> For you could not awaken compassion, jealousy or wrath at the very instant of your onset, in the way that a proof is seized upon as soon as propounded, and a second and third called for.

For, there being two sorts of wit, one running with even flow all through a speech, while the other, though incisive, is intermittent, the ancients called the former ' irony ' and the latter ' raillery.' <note type="margin" n="219">219</note> Each of these has a trivial name, but then of course all this business of laughter-raising is trivial. For all that, Antonius, as you remind me, I have very often seen much done in Court by humour and flashes of wit. But, while Art is not wanted in that continuous sort of jocularity (since Nature moulds mankind, and produces mimics and witty story-tellers, helped by their features, intonation and individual style of speaking), what room, pray, is there for Art in raillery, that other sort, wherein the shaft of wit has to be sped and hit its mark, with no palpable pause for thought? <note type="margin" n="220">220</note> <note type="margin">Illustrations of wit.</note> For what help could my brother here have got from Art, when Philippus<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a For Philippus see Index and Book I, § 24, supra.

For the speaker was sparing his opponent's reputation, and in so doing was maintaining his own, because it is a most difficult thing for men given to wit and raillery to have regard to personages and occasions, and to refrain from making observations which suggest themselves, when these could be brought out with most pungent effect. <note type="margin" n="222">222</note> So true is this that sundry jesters explain it (shrewdly enough) as being exactly what Ennius speaks of, when he says that' it is easier for a wise man to stifle a flame within his burning mouth than to keep words of worth to himself,' ' worth ' in this passage of course meaning ' pungency,' for such sayings are now known by a name of their own.

Finally, on the words ' I and my son Marcus happened to sit down together on Tiburtine land ' being read out from the third and concluding book (for I have heard Scaevola say that the authentic volumes of Brutus are three in number), Crassus exclaimed, ' Where are these estates, Brutus, which your father registered in his public memoirs as bequeathed to you?

    " And so, Antonius, I grant both your points, first the great and frequent utility of witticisms in oratory, secondly the absolute impossibility of learning these from art. One thing certainly surprises me, and that is your ascribing so much success in this sphere to myself, instead of awarding the prize for this, as for all else, to Crassus."
    <note type="margin" n="228">228</note> " I should certainly have done so," answered Antonius, " were I not now and then a little envious of Crassus in this connexion; for merely to be as witty and shrewd as you please need not excite unmeasured envy, but that the most attractive and polished of all speakers should at the same time be obviously the most impressive and austere, as has been the lot of our friend alone,—this did seem rather more than I could bear."
    <note type="margin" n="229">229</note> Even Crassus smiled at this, and Antonius went on, " However, Julius, though you denied the existence of any art of pleasantry, you did just start something that seemed worth teaching.

But it is a rule for the omission of uncalled-for witticisms, whereas we seek to know how to employ witticisms when wanted, —against an enemy, for instance, and most of all, if his stupidity can be ruffled, against a stupid, biased or unreliable witness, when people seem inclined to

<p>
regards laughter there are five matters for consideration: first, its nature; second, its source; third, whether willingness to produce it becomes an orator; fourth, the limits of his licence; fifth, the classification of things laughable.
    <note type="margin">(1) its nature;</note> " Now the first of these topics, the essential nature of laughter, the way it is occasioned, where it is seated, and how it comes into being, and bursts out so unexpectedly that, strive as we may, we cannot restrain it, and how at the same instant it takes possession of the lungs, voice, pulse, countenance and eyes,—all this I leave to Democritus<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a An eminent Greek physicist of the 5th century B.C.: known as ' the laughing philosopher.'</note>: for it does not concern the present conversation, and, even if it did, I should still not be ashamed to show ignorance of something which even its professed expositors do not understand.
    <note type="margin" n="236">236</note> <note type="margin">(2) its province;</note> " Then the field or province, so to speak, of the laughable (this being our next problem), is restricted to that which may be described as unseemly or ugly; for the chief, if not the only, objects of laughter are those sayings which remark upon and point out something unseemly in no unseemly manner.
    <note type="margin">(3) its rhetorical appropriateness;</note> " And again, to come to our third topic, it clearly becomes an orator to raise laughter, and this on various grounds; for instance, merriment naturally wins goodwill for its author; and everyone admires acuteness, which is often concentrated in a single word, uttered generally in repelling, though sometimes in delivering an attack; and it shatters or obstructs or makes light of an opponent, or alarms or repulses him; and it shows the orator himself to be a man of finish, accomplishment and taste; and, best of all, it relieves dullness and tones down austerity, and, by a jest or a laugh, often dispels dis-

tasteful suggestions not easily weakened by reasonings.
    <note type="margin" n="237">237</note> <note type="margin">(4) limits of its use:</note> " But the limits within which things laughable are to be handled by the orator, that fourth question we put to ourselves, is one calling for most careful consideration. For neither outstanding wickedness, such as involves crime, nor, on the other hand, outstanding wretchedness is assailed by ridicule, for the public would have the villainous hurt by a weapon rather more formidable than ridicule; while they dislike mockery of the wretched, except perhaps if these bear themselves arrogantly. And you must be especially tender of popular esteem, so that you do not inconsiderately speak ill of the well-beloved.
    <note type="margin" n="238">238</note>
    <note type="margin">(5) its objects classified</note>
    <milestone unit="section" n="59"/> LIX. " Such then is the restraint that, above all else, must be practised in jesting. Thus the things most easily ridiculed are those which call for neither strong disgust nor the deepest sympathy. This is why all laughing-matters are found among those blemishes noticeable in the conduct of people who are neither objects of general esteem nor yet full of misery, and not apparently merely fit to be hurried off to execution for their crimes; and these blemishes, if deftly handled, raise laughter. <note type="margin" n="239">239</note> In ugliness too and in physical blemishes there is good enough matter for jesting, but here as elsewhere the limits of licence are the main question. As to this, not only is there a rule excluding remarks made in bad taste, but also, even though you could say something with highly comical effect, an orator must avoid each of two dangers: he must not let his jesting become buffoonery or mere mimicking. We shall more readily understand examples of each kind when we come to the actual classification of things laughable.

    <note type="margin">Wit of matter and wit of form the former comprising anecdote and caricature.</note> " For there are two types of wit, one employed upon facts, the other upon words. <note type="margin" n="240">240</note> Upon facts, whenever any tale is told, some anecdote for instance, just as you, Crassus, alleged one day, in a speech against Memmius,<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a Gaius Memmius, a turbulent tribune of 111 B.C, against whose ferocious character this jest of Crassus seems to be levelled.</note> that Memmius ' had made a mouthful of Largus's arm,' when brawling with him at Tarracina over a lady-love; it was a spicy story, but every word of your own fabrication. You wound up by relating that the letters M.M.L.L.L. were inscribed on every wall in Tarracina, and that some ancient inhabitant answered, when you asked what they meant, ' Mordacious Memmius lacerates Largus's limb.' <note type="margin" n="241">241</note> You see plainly how graceful, choice and well befitting an orator is a jest of this sort, whether you have some truth you can relate,—which for all that may be sprinkled with fibs,—or whether you are only fabricating. Now the beauty of such jesting is, that you state your incidents in such a way, that the character, the manner of speaking and all the facial expressions of the hero of your tale, are so presented that those incidents seem to your audience to take place and to be transacted concurrently with your description of them. <note type="margin" n="242">242</note> Another sort of jest depending on facts, is that which is generally derived from what may be called vulgarized mimicry, as when on another occasion, Crassus was adjuring an adversary in the words, ' By your rank, by your lineage!' What else had the assembly to laugh at in this than that mimicry of facial expression and intonation? But when he went on to say, ' By your statuary,' and lent a touch of action to the word by stretching out his arm, we laughed quite consumedly.<note type="footnote" n="b" place="opposite">b This merriment may have been excited by an attack of Crassus upon Domitius Ahenobarbus, who was possibly disliked for his excessive family pride.</note> To this class belongs Roscius's famous representation of an old man, when he quavers out,' For you, son Antipho, I'm planting

    these.'<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a From a lost play.</note> I think I am listening to testy Eld personified. However this particular kind of laughing-matter is all such as to need extreme circumspection in the handling of it. For if the caricature is too extravagant, it becomes the work of buffoons in pantomime, as also does grossness. It behoves the orator to borrow merely a suspicion of mimicry, so that his hearer may imagine more than meets his eye; he must also testify to his own well-bred modesty, by avoiding all unseemly language and offensive gestures.

    <milestone unit="section" n="60"/> LX. " These then are the two kinds of the jesting that is founded on facts; and they are appropriate to continuous irony, wherein the characters of individuals are sketched and so portrayed, that either through the relation of some anecdote their real natures are understood, or, by the infusion of a trifle of mimicry, they are found out in some fault sufficiently marked to be laughed at.
    <note type="margin" n="244">244</note> " As regards words, however, the laughter is awakened by something pointed in a phrase or reflection. But just as, with the former kind, both in narrative and in mimicry, all likeness to buffoons in pantomime is to be avoided, so in this latter case the orator must scrupulously shun all buffoonish raillery. How then shall we distinguish from Crassus, from Catulus, and from the others, your familiar acquaintance Granius, or my own friend Vargula? Upon my word, I have never considered this matter, for all of them are witty, none indeed more so than Granius. The first point to make, I think, is that we should not feel bound to utter a witticism every time an occasion offers. <note type="margin" n="245">245</note> A very small witness once came forward. ' May I examine him? ' said Philippus.

<p>
    The president of the Court, who was in a hurry, answered, ' Only if you are short.' ' You will not complain,' returned Philippus, ' for I shall be just as short as that man is.' Quite comical; but there on the tribunal sat Lucius Aurifex, and he was even tinier than the witness: all the laughter was directed against Lucius, and the joke seemed merely buffoonish. And so those shafts which may light upon unintended victims, however featly they may be winged, are none the less essentially those of a buffoon. <note type="margin" n="246">246</note> For instance, that Appius, who tries to be witty, and egad! succeeds, though occasionally slipping into this failing of buffoonery, said to my one-eyed friend here, Gaius Sextius, ' I will sup with you, for I see you have room for another one.' This is the joke of a buffoon, for he attacked unprovoked, and even so only said what would apply to every one-eyed individual. Jokes of that sort, as they seem to be thought out in advance, win but little laughter. The retort of Sextius was brilliant and spontaneous: ' Wash your hands,' says he, ' before supper.'<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a Apparently a reflection upon the self-invited guest's probity. Compare the English legal maxim: ' He that cometh to Equity must come with clean hands.'</note>
    <note type="margin" n="247">247</note> " Regard then to occasions, control and restraint of our actual raillery, and economy in bon-mots, will distinguish an orator from a buffoon, as also will the fact that we people speak with good reason, not just to be thought funny, but to gain some benefit, while those others are jesting from morning to night, and without any reason at all.

    <note type="margin">Classification of verbal witticisms.</note>
    <milestone unit="section" n="61"/>LXI. " Now let us summarize the essential natures of the chief sources of laughter. Let our first distinction, then, be this, that a witty saying has its point sometimes in facts, sometimes in words, though people are most particularly amused whenever laughter is excited by the union of the two. But remember this, that whatever subjects I may touch upon, as being sources of laughing-matters, may equally well, as a rule, be sources of serious thoughts. The only difference is that seriousness is bestowed austerely and upon things of good repute, jesting upon what is a trifle unseemly, or, so to speak, uncouth; for example, we can, in identical terms, praise a careful servant, and make fun of one who is good-for-nothing. There is humour in that old remark of Nero's about a thievish servant, ' that he was the only member of the household against whom nothing was sealed up or locked away,' a description frequently applied to a trusty servant also, and that too word for word. <note type="margin" n="249">249</note> In fact all kinds of remarks are derived from identical sources. For his mother's words to Spurius Carvilius, who was sadly lame from a wound received on national service, and for that reason shy of walking abroad, ' No no, my Spurius, go out! and let every step you take remind you of your gallantry,' are noble and dignified. But what Glaucia said to Calvinus, who was limping,

    templation of lameness might suggest. Scipio's pun, ' Is there an idler knave than this Naevius? '<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a Professor Wilkins and others would sharpen the pun upon this name by substituting the less common form Navius.</note>, was intended for austerity. But there was a spark of humour in the remark of Philippus to a malodorous individual, ' I perceive that you are stinking me out.'<note type="footnote" n="b" place="opposite">b This alleged joke seems to require the coinage of a word hircumveniri, hircus being Latin not only for " goat," but also for the very rank odour characteristic of that animal.</note> Yet both kinds of pun lie in the verbal echo that survives the change in a letter.
    <note type="margin" n="250">250</note> <note type="margin">(1) The ambiguous;</note> " Bons-mots prompted by an equivocation are deemed the very wittiest, though not always concerned with jesting, but often even with what is important. What Publius Licinius Varus said to the great Africanus the elder, when he was adjusting a garland to his head at a banquet, and it tore again and again, was praiseworthy and creditable: ' Don't be astonished,' said he, ' if it does not fit, for it is on a Head of vast capacity.'<note type="footnote" n="c" place="opposite">c Caput is Latin for (1) a human cranium, (2) the Head of e.g. a body politic.</note> Yet from the same category comes, ' He is bald enough, seeing that he is bald in diction.'<note type="footnote" n="d" place="opposite">d Baldness may be natural or metaphorical: the exact point of this pleasantry seems to have eluded the commentators.</note> So, to bore you no further, there is no source of laughing-matters from which austere and serious thoughts are not also to be derived.
    <note type="margin" n="251">251</note> " There is also this to be noted, that all is not witty that is laughable. For can there be anything so droll as a pantaloon? Yet it is for his face, his grimaces, his mimicry of mannerisms, his intonation, and in fact his general bearing, that he is laughed at. Humorous I am able to call him, but humorous for a low comedian, and not in the sense in which I would have an orator humorous.
    <milestone unit="section" n="62"/> LXII. " Accordingly this kind of wit, though raising as much laughter as any, is not at all our kind: it caricatures peevishness, fanaticism, mistrust, pomposity and folly, characters which are laughed at for their own sakes, masks which we do not put on, but

    attack. <note type="margin" n="252">252</note> Another kind, quite comical, consists in mimicry, but this we may employ only by stealth, if at all, and but momentarily, as fuller use of it does not befit the well-bred. A third kind is grimacing, which is beneath our dignity. A fourth is indecency, not only degrading to a public speaker, but hardly sufferable at a gentlemen's dinner-party. When all these modes, then, are withheld from this branch of oratory, the residue of wit depends apparently either on the facts or on the language, in accordance with the distinction I have already drawn. For the joke which still remains witty, in whatever words it is couched, has its germ in the facts; that which loses its pungency, as soon as it is differently worded, owes all its humour to the language.
    <note type="margin" n="253">253</note>" The play upon equivocal words is particularly clever, and depends on language, not on facts; but it seldom raises any considerable laughter, being chiefly praised as evidence of elegant scholarship: take, for example, that hit at the notorious Titius, who was devoted to ball-play and also under suspicion of mutilating the holy statues by night: when his associates missed him, as he had not come to the Playing Fields, Vespa Terentius apologized for his absence on the plea, ' He has broken an arm '<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a Was it his own or a holy statue's?</note>: or again, take the words of Africanus, preserved in Lucilius,

Indeed the play upon words wins really vast applause on its own merits, as I said before, for the power to divert the force of a word into a sense quite different from that in which other folk understand it, seems to indicate a man of talent; yet the jest arouses wonder rather than laughter, except when it also falls within some other category of the laughable.

In this case our own mistake even makes us laugh ourselves. But, if there be also an admixture of equivocation, the jest is rendered more pungent: as, in that play of Novius, the man is apparently moved by compassion when, on seeing a condemned debtor taken away, he earnestly inquires the amount of the judgement. He is told,' A thousand sesterces.' Had he then gone on to say merely, ' You may take him away,' his rejoinder would have belonged to the unexpected kind, but what he actually said was,' No advance from me; you may take him away,' whereby he brought in an element of equivocation, a different category of the laughable, the result, in my opinion at any rate, being piquancy in perfection.<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a The piquant equivocation must lurk in ' nihil addo,' which may mean, ' I say no more,' or (at an auction) ' I bid no more.'</note> This playing on words is most delightful when, during a wrangle, a word is snatched from an antagonist and used to hurl a shaft at the assailant himself, as was done by Catulus against Philippus.<note type="footnote" n="b" place="opposite">b See the anecdote related supra, Book II, liv.</note> <note type="margin" n="256">256</note> But since equivocation is of numerous kinds, and the teaching as to these is somewhat abstruse, we shall have to be watchful and lie in wait for the words: in this way, while avoiding the feebler retorts (for we must

But no more of farces; I merely wish this type of laughing-matter to be illustrated by some prominent and familiar example. This too is the origin, Crassus, of your recent reply to the person who had asked you whether he would be a nuisance to you, if he were to visit you well before daylight: ' No,' you answered, ' you will not be a nuisance.'

    <milestone unit="section" n="65"/> LXV. " Jests dependent upon language further include such as are derived from allegory, from the figurative use of a single word, or from the ironical inversion of verbal meanings. Allegory as a source was illustrated by Rusca long ago, in moving his Limit of Age Bill,<note type="footnote" n="c">c Designed to fix a minimum age for candidates for any political office.</note> when Marcus Servilius, an opponent of the measure, said to him, ' Tell me, Marcus Pinarius, if I speak against you, are you going to revile me as you have done the others? ' <note type="margin" n="262">262</note> Rusca's reply was, ' You shall reap your sowing.' Figurative use of one word occurred, for example, when great Scipio the elder told the Corinthians, who were promising him a statue among those of the other commanders-in-chief, that ' he had no liking for statues in troops.' And meanings were ironically inverted when Crassus was representing Aculeo before Marcus Perperna as arbitrator, and Lucius Aelius Lamia, a cripple as you know, was for Gratidianus against Aculeo, and kept on interrupting

    function of joking; as the shortest possible example of this you may very well take Crassus's tale about Memmius,<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a See Book II, lix., supra.</note> which I cited before. To this class we may also refer the stories in the fables. <note type="margin" n="265">265</note> Material is derived too from history, as when Sextus Titius was describing himself as a Cassandra,<note type="footnote" n="b" place="opposite">b He meant that his prophecies of public disasters at Rome had met with no more credit than those of Cassandra, King Priam's daughter, at Troy, though they had proved as consistently true. After the fall of Troy the prophetess was outraged by this Ajax. I follow Conington on Aeneid i. 46 in treating Oileos as a Greek genitive singular, not an accusative plural.</note> and Antonius commented, ' I can name many who played Ajax, the son of Oileus, to your Cassandra.'
    <note type="margin">comparison</note> " Another source of such pleasantry is resemblance, involving either comparison or something like portraiture. Comparison is illustrated by that Gallus, who once upon a time gave evidence against Piso that Piso's lieutenant Magius had received vast sums of money, which testimony Scaurus was for contradicting by proving the straitened circumstances of Magius, whereupon Gallus observed, ' You are missing the point, Scaurus, for I do not assert that Magius still has this fund, but that he has tucked it away in his paunch, like a naked man who goes nutting.'<note type="footnote" n="c" place="opposite">c The allegation is that the money has been squandered in self-indulgence, after being received by Magius on behalf of Piso, who is on trial for extortion.</note> To take another instance, the eminent Marcus Cicero the elder, father of the best man of our time, our own friend, said that our contemporaries were like the Syrian slave-market: ' the better knowledge they had of Greeks, the more worthless were their respective characters.'

    <note type="margin" n="272">272</note> " A jest very closely resembles this ironical type when something disgraceful is called by an honourable epithet, as happened when Africanus as censor removed from his tribe that centurion who failed to appear at the battle<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a The victory over Perseus at Pydna in 168 B.C.</note> fought under Paulus, though the defaulter pleaded that he had stayed in camp on guard, and sought to know why he was degraded by the censor: ' I am no lover of the over-cautious,' was the answer of Africanus. <note type="margin" n="273">273</note> There is point too in taking some part of another's words in a sense differing from that which he intended, as Maximus<note type="footnote" n="b" place="opposite">b Quintus Fabius Maximus.</note> did with Salinator<note type="footnote" n="c" place="opposite">c Marcus Livius Salinator, this cognomen being probably a mistake of Cicero's for Macatus.</note> when, after the loss of Tarentum, Livius had nevertheless held the citadel, and made a number of brilliant sallies from it, and Fabius, several years later, recaptured the town itself, whereupon Livius begged him to remember that the recapture of Tarentum had been due to his own achievement.

" A jest of this sort is rather trivial, and, as I said, fit for farces, but now and then even we orators find room for one of them, with the result that even a man who is no fool says something in the manner of a fool, but not without humour, as Mancia did to yourself, Antonius, on hearing that you were being prosecuted by Marcus Duronius for corrupt practices during your censorship; ' At last,' said he, ' you will be able to attend to business of your own.' <note type="margin" n="275">275</note> These jokes provoke hearty laughter, and so most assuredly does everything that is said ironically by the wise, and somewhat absurdly, but not without humour. Another jest from this class is pretending not to understand what you understand perfectly, as when Pontidius, being asked his opinion of the man who is taken in adultery, replied: ' He is a slowcoach,' or as when, at a muster of troops, Metellus rejected the excuse I pleaded of weak eyesight, and said to me, <note type="margin" n="276">276</note> ' Can you then see nothing?

In the same group is the remark made by Catulus to a poor speaker who, after resuming his seat with the impression that his concluding remarks had aroused the audience's pity, inquired of Catulus whether he thought he had been successful in arousing pity; ' Oh yes, and plenty of it,' was the reply, ' for I can't imagine

    ' Sire, why dost thou lament? '
    ' 'Twere strange did I not sing, who am under sentence!'
    A kind of jest that is just the opposite of this is the tolerant and gentle sort—for example, Cato's when he had been jostled by a man carrying a box, who said ' Look out,' and he asked ' What, are you carrying something else beside that box? ' <note type="margin" n="280">280</note> There is also a neat way of reproving folly, for instance the remark of the Sicilian to whom Scipio<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a No Scipio is known to us to have been praetor in Sicily.</note> when praetor was assigning as counsel in a law-suit his host, a person of position but rather stupid: ' Pray, Mr. Praetor, assign that gentleman as counsel<note type="footnote" n="b" place="opposite">b Apparently the presiding magistrate assigned such assistance to a litigant who was a provincial and presumably ignorant of Roman law.</note> to my opponent, and then I will not ask you to assign any counsel to me.' Also effective are conjectural explanations of a document that are completely at variance with the real meaning but are cleverly and wittily put: as for instance, in the prosecution of Rutilius by Scaurus on the charge of corrupt practices in the election to the consulship which Scaurus himself had won and Rutilius had lost, when Scaurus called attention to the entry A. F. P. R. in Rutilius's election accounts, and said that they stood for ' Acting for Pubilius Rutilius,' whereas Rutilius said they meant ' Allocated formerly, posted up recently,' Sir Gaius Canius, who appeared for Rufus, called out that both

Another pretty turn is a friendly criticism of an implied mistake, as when Granius reproved Albius because, when Albucius was held to have proved a statement on the evidence of Albius's accounts, Albius was not only much delighted by Scaevola's acquittal but actually failed to see that a verdict had been given against his own accounts. <note type="margin" n="282">282</note> Also similar to this is giving a friendly hint by way of advice: for instance, when Granius was recommending an incompetent advocate who in the course of a speech had talked himself hoarse to have a drink of chilled wine and honey as soon as he got home, he answered ' If I do that, I shall ruin my voice,' and Granius retorted ' Better ruin your voice than ruin your client.' <note type="margin" n="283">283</note> It is also a neat turn to point out what goes with anybody's individual characteristics; as for instance, when Scaurus was somewhat under a cloud for having taken possession of the estate of a wealthy person named Pompeius Phrygio who had died intestate, and was appearing in court as an assessor on behalf of a defendant named Bestia, a funeral happened to pass by, and Gaius Memmius who was for the prosecution said, ' Look, Scaurus, there's a dead man being bundled out of the way—if only you can get possession.' <note type="margin" n="284">284</note> But of all these devices nothing causes more amusement than an unexpected turn, of which there are countless instances—for example, the remark of old Appius senior,<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a Probably the grandfather of Cicero's enemy P.

From this point of view however nothing could be wittier than the remark of Crassus: serious damage had been done to the case of a certain Piso by a witness named Silus, who had said that he had heard something against him; ' It may be the case, Silus,' said Crassus, ' that the person whose remark you say you heard was speaking in anger.' Silus nodded assent. ' It is also possible that you misunderstood him.' To this also Silus nodded very emphatic assent, so putting himself into Crassus's hands. ' It is also possible,' he continued, ' that what you say you heard, you never really heard at all.' This was so entirely unexpected a turn that the witness was overwhelmed by a burst of laughter from the whole court. Novius is full of quips of this sort: everyone knows his jape,' Even a philosopher like you, if he is cold, will shiver,' and a great many more.

Also when people ask you something and keep on repeating the question it is witty gently to give the very reply they don't want: for example when the censor Lepidus had taken a horse from Marcus Antistius of Pyrgi and Antistius's friends made an outcry and kept asking him what answer he should give his father to explain why his horse had been taken away from him, a first-class farmer, and an extremely economical and moderate and thrifty person, he said his answer would be ' I don't accept any of that!' <note type="margin" n="288">288</note> The Greeks include some other varieties, execration, astonishment, threats, but I feel I have overdone my classification of these witticisms already; for the notions contained in the meaning and force of a word are usually clear and definite, and most of them, as I said before,<note type="footnote" n="b" place="opposite">b §254.</note> usually excite more applause than ridicule; <note type="margin" n="289">289</note> whereas the points comprised in the actual fact and meaning,

For my part when I am launched on a case and have to the best of my ability passed all the facts under consideration, having discerned and ascertained the arguments that belong to the case and also the topics calculated to win the favour of the court and those adapted to arouse its emotions, I then decide what are the good and what the bad points in the case of each of the parties, as it is almost impossible for any matter to be brought under discussion or dispute which does not contain both—the thing that matters is how much of them it contains; <note type="margin" n="292">292</note> but my own method in a speech usually is to take the good points of my case and elaborate these, embellishing and enlarging and lingering and dwelling on and sticking to them, while any bad part or weakness in my case I leave on one side, not in such a manner as to give the appearance of running away from it but so as to disguise it and entirely cover it up by embellishing and amplifying the good point referred to; and if the case is one that turns on arguments, I maintain all the strongest among them in the fullest measure, whether they are several or only one, or if it is a matter of winning favour or arousing feeling, I concentrate particularly on the part of the case that is most capable of influencing men's minds. <note type="margin" n="293">293</note> In short, the chief thing in a case of this kind is, if my speech can be stronger in refuting our opponent than in proving our own points, for me to concentrate all my shafts upon him, but if on the contrary our points can be more easily proved than his can be refuted, to aim at drawing off their attention from our opponent's defence and directing it to our own. <note type="margin" n="294">294</note> Finally there are two lines that appear extremely easy—as the more difficult ones are beyond

But I am not at the moment talking about some outstanding and exceptional ability but about ordinary average capacity. For instance, we are told that the famous Athenian Themistocles was endowed with wisdom and genius on a scale quite surpassing belief; and it is said that a certain learned and highly accomplished person went to him and offered to impart to him the science of mnemonics, which was then being introduced for the first time; and that when Themistocles asked what precise result that science was capable of achieving, the professor asserted that it would enable him to remember everything; and Themistocles replied that he would be doing him a greater kindness if he taught him to forget what he wanted than if he taught him to remember. <note type="margin" n="300">300</note> Do you observe what mental force and penetration the man possessed, what power and range of intellect? inasmuch as his answer brings home to us that nothing that had once been introduced into his mind had ever been able to pass out of it, inasmuch as he would rather have been able to forget something that he did not wish to remember than to remember everything that he had once heard or seen.

And even if Crassus does not make this mistake, it does not follow that it is not made by many people and frequently; and for my part I always think nothing more disgraceful than when some statement or reply or question made by a speaker is followed by the remark ' He's done for it!

    <milestone unit="section" n="76"/> LXXVI. " Accordingly I now return to the point in respect of which, Catulus, you were praising me just now, the question of the order and arrangement of one's facts and topics. In respect of this there are two rules of procedure, one arising from the nature of the cases and the other contributed by the discretion and the wisdom of the speakers: for to make some prefatory remarks, then to set out our case, afterwards to prove it by establishing our own points with arguments in their favour and refuting our adversary's points, then to wind up our case and so to come to our conclusion—this is the procedure enjoined by the very nature of oratory; <note type="margin" n="308">308</note> but to decide how to arrange the statements that have to be made for the purpose of establishing and explaining our case—that is in the highest degree a task for professional skill. For many arguments occur to us, and many considerations that appear likely to be of use to us in speaking; but some of these are so unimportant as not to deserve notice, and some, even if they offer some amount of assistance, are occasionally of such a nature that they contain some flaw and that the amount of assistance they seem to provide is not of such value as to be used in conjunction with a definitely detrimental point; <note type="margin" n="309">309</note> while if nevertheless, as frequently happens, there are numerous advantages and strong arguments, in my judgement those

<pb n="435"/>
<p>
    among them that are the least weighty or that closely resemble others that are weightier ought to be discarded and left out of the speech: in my own case when I am collecting arguments for my cases I make it my practice not so much to count them as to weigh them. <note type="margin" n="310">310</note> <milestone unit="section" n="77"/> LXXVII. And because (as I have repeatedly said already) there are three methods of bringing people to hold our opinion, instruction or persuasion or appeal to their emotions, one of these three methods we must openly display, so as to appear to wish solely to impart instruction, whereas the two remaining methods should be interfused throughout the whole of the structure of our speeches like the blood in our bodies. For as for the exordium and the other divisions of a speech, about which we shall make a few remarks a little later,<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a §§ 326, 333.</note> it is essential that they should have the power of being able to exert this influence in stirring the minds of the audience; <note type="margin" n="311">311</note> <note type="margin">places for appeals to emotion;</note> but in regard to the portions of a speech that in spite of proving no point by means of argument, nevertheless have a very great effect in persuading and arousing emotion, although the most appropriate place for them is in the introduction and the conclusion, nevertheless it is often useful to digress from the subject one has put forward and is dealing with, for the purpose of arousing emotion; <note type="margin" n="312">312</note> and accordingly very often either a place is given to a digression devoted to exciting emotion after we have related the facts and stated our case, or this can rightly be done after we have established our own arguments or refuted those of our opponents, or in both places, or in all the parts of the speech, if the case is one of this importance and extent; and the cases that are the weightiest and fullest for amplification and embellishment are those

But one's opening remarks, though they should always be carefully framed and pointed and epigrammatic and
</p>


<pb n="439"/>

<p>
    suitably expressed, must at the same time be appropriate to the case in hand; for the opening passage contains the first impression and the introduction of the speech, and this ought to charm and attract the hearer straight away. <note type="margin" n="316">316</note> This is a point in respect of which I am constantly surprised, not indeed at people who have given no attention to oratory, but at Philip, a person of outstanding and accomplished eloquence, whose habit it is to get up to make a speech without knowing what is to be the first word he will utter; what he says about it is that his way is to warm up his biceps first and then start fighting—not observing that even the professionals from whom he derives this metaphor when throwing the spear deliver their first throws gently, so as to make their movements as graceful as possible and also to economize the remainder of their strength. <note type="margin" n="317">317</note> Nor is there any doubt that the opening passage of a speech ought not as a rule to be of a forcible, fighting character; but if in an actual fight to the death between gladiators, where the decision is made by the steel, nevertheless before closing a number of strokes are made that seem not to be intended to inflict a wound but to be done for the sake of appearance, how much more proper is it for this to be taken into consideration in making a speech, where what is asked for is not so much force as entertainment! In conclusion, nothing exists in the physical universe that emerges as a whole and develops completely all in a moment: so true is it that all processes and actions of extreme rapidity have been provided by Nature herself with more gentle commencements. <note type="margin" n="318">318</note> But the opening passage in a speech must not be drawn from some outside source but from the very heart of the case; consequently
</p>


<pb n="441"/>

<p>
    our case must first be thoroughly considered and examined as a whole, and all our topics thought out and arranged, before we consider what opening to employ. <note type="margin" n="319">319</note> In this way just as openings will be easily discovered—for they will be taken from the subjects that will prove most fertile either in the argumentative passages or in the digressions upon which I said we must frequently enter—, so also they will contribute an element of movement, as they will be taken from almost the most essential part of the defence, and it will be felt not merely that they are not generalities and capable of being transferred into another case, but that they are essentially the natural outcome of the case under consideration. <note type="margin" n="320">320</note> <milestone unit="section" n="79"/> LXXIX. Every introduction will have to contain either a statement of the whole of the matter that is to be put forward, or an approach to the case and a preparation of the ground, or else to possess some element of ornament and dignity; but the opening passage put at the beginning of a case should be in due proportion to the importance of the facts, just as a forecourt or an entrance should be properly proportioned to the mansion or temple to which it belongs; and consequently in petty cases and ones not attracting much attention it is often more suitable to start straight away with the actual charge; <note type="margin" n="321">321</note> whereas when it is proper to employ a formal opening, as will mostly be the case, it will be possible to draw subjects either from one's client or from one's opponent or from the charge or from the members of the court before whom it is to be brought. Points drawn from one's client—by clients I mean the persons concerned in the matter—are considerations showing him to be a man of high character, a gentleman, a victim of mis-

Conciliation of the audience must indeed permeate the whole of the speech, and especially the peroration, but nevertheless this class of consideration does supply a great many modes of opening. <note type="margin" n="323">323</note> <note type="margin">narration of circumstances;</note> For the Greeks advise us to use the opening passage for securing the attention of the judge and making him receptive, and these are valuable things, though
    they do not belong more to the introduction than to the other parts of a speech; moreover they are easier in the introduction, because the audience are most attentive when they have the whole of the speech to look forward to, and also they are more receptive at the start, for statements made at the beginning, whether aimed at proof or at refutation, stand out clearer than those made in the middle of a case. <note type="margin" n="324">324</note> But we shall derive our greatest supply of openings designed either to conciliate or to stimulate the judge from topics contained in the case that are calculated to produce emotions, though it will not be proper to develop these fully at the start, but only to give a slight preliminary impulsion to the judge, so that the remainder of our speech may find him already biassed in our direction. <note type="margin" n="325">325</note> <milestone unit="section" n="80"/> LXXX. But the opening passage

<pb n="445"/>

<p>
should be so closely connected with the speech that follows as to appear to be not an appendage, like the prelude to a piece of music, but an integral part of the whole structure. For some musicians play their prelude after due practice, but pass on to the remainder of the work in such a manner as to seem not really to want to be listened to. Also the preliminary passage must not be like the skirmishing of Samnite gladiators, who before a fight brandish their spears which they are not going to make any use of in the actual encounter, but must be of such a character as to enable the combatants to employ in the real encounter the very ideas which they have made play with in the introduction.
    <note type="margin" n="326">326</note> "As for their rule that the narration of the case must be brief, if the term brevity may be used to denote the absence of a single word that is superfluous. Lucius Crassus's style has brevity; but if brevity means employing only the absolutely essential minimum of words, this is required occasionally, but often it is actually very detrimental in stating the facts of the case, not only because it causes obscurity but also because it does away with a quality that is the greatest merit in narrative, that of entertaining and convincing.

For in cases at law the pleading that serves to prove the line adopted may be said to have only a single principle, though it aims at both proof and refutation; but inasmuch as it is neither possible to refute statements made against you unless you prove your own, nor to prove your own statements without refuting your opponent's, it follows that these proceedings are connected together not only by nature but also in respect of their value for your case and the method of handling them. <note type="margin" n="332">332</note> But all these arguments must as a rule be rounded off either by enlarging on your points or by arousing the feelings of the judge or calming them down; and all of them both in the

    action does seem to me to be a task for a person of the greatest weight of character, for to expound one's advice on matters of high importance calls for both wisdom and ability and eloquence, to enable one to make an intelligent forecast, give an authoritative proof and employ persuasive eloquence. <milestone unit="section" n="82"/> LXXXII. And these ends can be achieved with less apparatus in the Senate, as that is a wise deliberative body, and one should leave room for many others to speak, beside avoiding any suspicion of a display of talent, <note type="margin" n="334">334</note> whereas a public meeting permits of the full employment of powerful and weighty oratory, and requires variety. Consequently in an advisory speech nothing is more desirable than dignity; for a man who demands mere expediency does not see his adviser's main purpose but only his more immediate aim for the time being. For there is nobody, especially in a famous state like ours, who does not think that moral worth is the highest object of ambition, but for the most part expediency wins the day when there is a covert fear lest if expediency be neglected worth will also have to be abandoned. <note type="margin" n="335">335</note> But differences of opinion arise either on the question which of two alternatives is more expedient, or even supposing there is agreement about this, it is disputed whether
</p>


<pb n="453"/>
<p>
    the chief consideration should be integrity or expediency; and as these two considerations often seem to conflict, the champion of expediency will reel off a list of the advantages of peace and wealth and power and revenue and military strength and all the other things whose value we measure by expediency, and also the disadvantages of their opposites, whereas one who urges us on the path of moral worth will collect examples of our ancestors' achievements that were glorious even though involving danger, and will magnify the value of an undying memory with posterity and maintain that glory engenders advantage and moral worth is invariably linked with it. <note type="margin" n="336">336</note> But in both departments it is of the greatest importance to inquire what is possible and what is impossible of achievement, and also what is inevitable or the reverse; for all debate is at once cut short by the realization that a thing is impossible or if it is proved to be inevitable, and the philosopher<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a Aristotle, Rhet. I. iv. 2.</note> who taught this truth, which others did not discern, showed the greatest insight. <note type="margin" n="337">337</note> But the chief essential for giving counsel on affairs of state is a knowledge of the constitution of the state, whereas the thing that is essential for persuasive speaking is a knowledge of the national character; and as this frequently alters, it is often necessary also to alter the style of speaking employed; and although the fundamental nature of eloquence practically does not vary, nevertheless in view of the exalted dignity of the nation, the supreme importance of politics, and the violent passions of the crowd, it would seem that an oratorical style of more than average grandeur and brilliance is required; and the greatest part of a speech must occasionally be directed to arousing the emotions of the

But as the orator's chief stage seems to be the platform at a public meeting, it naturally results that we are stimulated to employ the more ornate kind of oratory; for the effect produced by numbers is of such a kind that a speaker can no more be eloquent without a large audience than a flute-player can perform without a flute. <note type="margin" n="339">339</note> And as there are a number of different ways of falling foul of the public, one must be careful not to arouse the disapproving outcries of the people, who are aroused either by some error in the speech, if a remark is thought to be harsh or arrogant or base or mean or to show some fault of character, or by personal annoyance or dislike that is either deserved or arises from slander and rumour, or if the subject is unpopular, or if the public is in a state of excitement arising out of some desire or alarm that it feels. These four causes of unpopularity can be met by as many remedies: sometimes by reproof, if one possesses authority, sometimes by admonition, which may be called a gentle form of reproof, sometimes by promising that if they will hear us out they will agree with us, and sometime, by apology, which is not a strong line to take, but is sometimes useful. <note type="margin" n="340">340</note> And in no other place is there more to be gained by using facetious turns and a rapid style and epigrammatic remarks expressed in a dignified and attractive way; for nothing is so easy as to divert a crowd from gloominess and often from bitter feeling by means of a neat and terse and pointed and amusing phrase.

" I have practically completed giving you an account, to the best of my ability, of the rules that I am accustomed to follow, and the faults which I try to avoid and the objects which I have in view in both kinds of cases, and generally of the method that I adopt in law-suits. <note type="margin" n="341">341</note> Nor is there any difficulty about <note type="margin">Panegyrics.</note> the third class, consisting of panegyrics, which I had excluded from our set of instructions at the outset. But there are a great many kinds of oratory that are both more dignified and wider in scope, which virtually nobody lays down rules about, and also we Romans do not much practise the custom of panegyrics, so consequently I put this department entirely on one side. For the Greeks themselves have constantly thrown off masses of panegyrics, designed more for reading and for entertainment, or for giving a laudatory account of some person, than for the practical purposes of public life with which we are now concerned: there are Greek books containing panegyrics of Themistocles, Aristides, Agesilaus, Epaminondas, Philip, Alexander and others; whereas our Roman commendatory speeches that we make in the forum have either the bare and unadorned brevity of evidence to a person's character or are written to be delivered as a funeral speech, which is by no means a suitable occasion for parading one's distinction in rhetoric. But nevertheless, as laudatory speeches must be delivered occasionally and sometimes even written out, either as Gaius Laelius wrote a panegyric for Quintus Tubero to deliver on his uncle Africanus, or in order that we ourselves may be able if we wish to praise certain persons in an honorific speech in the Greek manner, let us also treat of this topic. <note type="margin" n="342">342</note> Well then, it is clear
</p>
<!-- On the bottom of the page: "Q" -->


<pb n="459"/>

<p>
    that the qualities that are desirable in a person are not the same as those that are praiseworthy: family, good looks, bodily strength, resources, riches and the rest of the external or personal gifts of fortune do not in themselves contain any true ground for praise, which is held to be due to virtue alone; but nevertheless, as it is in the employment and wise management of these that virtue itself is very largely discerned, a panegyric must also treat of these goods of nature and of fortune in which the highest praise is not to have been puffed up in office or insolent in wealth, or to have put oneself in front of others because of fortune's bounty—so that wealth and riches may seem to have provided opportunity and occasion not for pride and licence but for beneficence and temperance. <note type="margin" n="343">343</note> But virtue, which is praiseworthy in itself and is a necessary element in anything that can be praised, nevertheless contains several divisions, one of which is more fit to be praised than another. For there are some virtues that are manifested as qualities of people's behaviour and by a sort of kindness and beneficence, while others consist in intellectual ability or in highmindedness and strength of character; inasmuch as mercy, justice, kindness, fidelity, courage in common dangers are acceptable topics in a panegyric, <note type="margin" n="344">344</note> since all these virtues are thought to be beneficial not so much to their possessors as to the human race in general, whereas wisdom, and magnanimity that counts all human fortunes slight and worthless, and strength and originality of intellect, and eloquence itself are not less admired it is true but give less pleasure, because they seem to grace and to safeguard the subjects of our panegyrics themselves rather than the persons
</p>


<pb n="461"/>

<p>
before whom they are delivered. But nevertheless virtues of these kinds also should be introduced in a panegyric, since an audience will accept the bestowal of praise on the aspects of virtue that call for admiration as well as on those that give pleasure and gratification.
    <note type="margin" n="345">345</note> <milestone unit="section" n="85"/> LXXXV. " And since particular virtues have their own definite duties and functions and each virtue has an appropriate form of commendation that is due to it, in giving praise for justice it will be necessary to recite actions of the subject of our panegyric that exhibited fidelity and fairness, and any right conduct of that nature; and similarly under the other heads our account of his actions will be fitted in to each successive class and meaning and designation of virtue. <note type="margin" n="346">346</note> But the most welcome praise is that bestowed on deeds that appear to have been performed by brave men without profit or reward; while those that also involve toil and personal danger supply very fertile topics for panegyric, because they admit of being narrated in a most eloquent style and of obtaining the readiest reception from the audience; for it is virtue that is profitable to others, and either toilsome or dangerous or at all events not profitable to its possessor, that is deemed to mark a man of outstanding merit. Also it is customarily recognized as a great and admirable distinction to have borne adversity wisely, not to have been crushed by misfortune, and not to have lost dignity in a difficult situation; <note type="margin" n="347">347</note> and distinction is also conferred by offices filled, rewards of merit bestowed, and achievements honoured by the judgement of mankind; in these matters moreover it is proper to a panegyric to attribute what is merely good fortune to the verdict

<p>
    of divine wisdom. And one must select achievements that are of outstanding importance or unprecedented or unparalleled in their actual character; for small achievements or those that are not unusual or out of the ordinary are not as a rule felt to be specially admirable or to deserve praise at all. <note type="margin" n="348">348</note> Moreover a splendid line to take in a paneygric is to compare the subject with all other men of high distinction. And the spirit has moved me to enlarge rather more fully on this class of topic than I had promised to do, not so much for the purpose of its employment in the courts, which has been my subject in the whole of this discourse, as to bring home to you the fact that if the functions of a speaker include the delivery of panegyrics, which nobody denies, a speaker is bound to possess, as an indispensable means for the construction of a panegyric, a knowledge of all the virtues. <note type="margin" n="349">349</note> Then, it is clear that the rules for assigning blame have to be developed out of the vices that are the opposites of these virtues; at the same time it is obvious that it is impossible either to praise a good man appropriately and fully without a knowledge of the virtues or to brand and blame a wicked man in a sufficiently impressive and crushing manner without a knowledge of the vices. And these topics of praise and blame we shall frequently have occasion to employ in every class of law-suit.
    <note type="margin" n="350">350</note>" I have given you my view in regard to the discovery and the arrangement of topics; I will also add something on the subject of memory, in order to lighten the task of Crassus and to leave him nothing else to discuss except the method of elaborating these subjects."

</p>


<pb n="465"/>
<p>
am delighted to see you at last known as a master of the theory, finally unmasked and stripped of the veil of your pretended ignorance; and it is extremely obliging of you to leave little or nothing to me, and I am grateful for it."
    <note type="margin" n="351">351</note> <note type="margin">Memory; memoria technica: the pigeonhole method.</note> " Oh, as for that," said Antony, "the amount I shall have left to you will be for you to decide; if you
    want complete candour, what I leave to you is the whole subject, but if you want me to keep up the pretence, it is for you to consider how you may satisfy our friends here. But to return to the subject," he continued," I am not myself as clever as Themistocles<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a See § 299.</note> was, so as to prefer the science of forgetting to that of remembering; and I am grateful to the famous Simonides of Ceos, who is said to have first invented the science of mnemonics. <note type="margin" n="352">352</note> There is a story that Simonides was dining at the house of a wealthy nobleman named Scopas at Crannon in Thessaly, and chanted a lyric poem which he had composed in honour of his host, in which he followed the custom of the poets by including for decorative purposes a long passage referring to Castor and Pollux; whereupon Scopas with excessive meanness told him he would pay him half the fee agreed on for the poem, and if he liked he might apply for the balance to his sons of Tyndareus, as they had gone halves in the panegyric. <note type="margin" n="353">353</note> The story runs that a little later a message was brought to Simonides to go outside, as two young men were standing at the door who earnestly requested him to come out; so he rose from his seat and went out, and could not see anybody; but in the interval of his absence the roof of the hall where Scopas was giving the banquet fell in, crushing Scopas himself and his relations underneath the ruins and

<p>
    killing them; and when their friends wanted to bury them but were altogether unable to know them apart as they had been completely crushed, the story goes that Simonides was enabled by his recollection of the place in which each of them had been reclining at table to identify them for separate interment; and that this circumstance suggested to him the discovery of the truth that the best aid to clearness of memory consists in orderly arrangement. <note type="margin" n="354">354</note> He inferred that persons desiring to train this faculty must select localities and form mental images of the facts they wish to remember and store those images in the localities, with the result that the arrangement of the localities will preserve the order of the facts, and the images of the facts will designate the facts themselves, and we shall employ the localities and images respectively as a wax writing tablet and the letters written on it. <note type="margin" n="355">355</note> <milestone unit="section" n="87"/> LXXXVII. But what business is it of mine to specify the value to a speaker and the usefulness and effectiveness of memory? of retaining the information given you when you were briefed and the opinions you yourself have formed? of having all your ideas firmly planted in your mind and all your resources of vocabulary neatly arranged? of giving such close attention to the instructions of your client and to the speech of the opponent you have to answer that they may seem not just to pour what they say into your ears but to imprint it on your mind? Consequently only people with a powerful memory know what they are going to say and for how long they are going to speak and in what style, what points they have already answered and what still remains; and they also can remember from other cases many arguments which they have
</p>


<pb n="469"/>

<p>
    previously advanced and many which they have heard from other people. <note type="margin" n="356">356</note> And consequently for my own part I confess that the chief source of this endowment, as of all the things I have spoken of before, is nature; but the efficacy of the whole of this science, or perhaps I should say pseudo-science, of rhetoric, is not that it wholly originates and engenders something no part of which is already present in our minds, but that it fosters and strengthens things that have already sprung to birth within us; <note type="margin" n="357">357</note> though nevertheless hardly anybody exists who has so keen a memory that he can retain the order of all the words or sentences without having arranged and noted his facts, nor yet is anybody so dull-witted that habitual practice in this will not give him some assistance. It has been sagaciously discerned by Simonides or else discovered by some other person, that the most complete pictures are formed in our minds of the things that have been conveyed to them and imprinted on them by the senses, but that the keenest of all our senses is the sense of sight, and that consequently perceptions received by the ears or by reflexion can be most easily retained in the mind if they are also conveyed to our minds by the mediation of the eyes, with the result that things not seen and not lying in the field of visual discernment are earmarked by a sort of outline and image and shape so that we keep hold of as it were by an act of sight things that we can scarcely embrace by an act of thought. <note type="margin" n="358">358</note> But these forms and bodies, like all the things that come under our view<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a After ' view ' some inferior MSS. insert ' serve to prompt and stimulate our memory.'</note> require an abode, inasmuch as a material object without a locality is inconceivable. Consequently (in order that I may not be prolix and tedious on a sub-
</p>


<pb n="471"/>

<p>
    ject that is well known and familiar) one must employ a large number of localities which must be clear and defined and at moderate intervals apart, and images that are effective and sharply outlined and distinctive, with the capacity of encountering and speedily penetrating the mind; the ability to use these will be supplied by practice, which engenders habit, and by marking off similar words with an inversion and alteration of their cases or a transference from species to genus, and by representing a whole concept by the image of single word, on the system and method of a consummate painter distinguishing the positions of objects by modifying their shapes.<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a The phrase denotes what we call ' perspective.'</note> <note type="margin" n="359">359</note> <milestone unit="section" n="88"/> LXXXVIII. But a memory for words, which for us is less essential,<note type="footnote" n="b" place="opposite">b Cato's rule was Rem tene, verba sequentur.</note> is given distinctness by a greater variety of images; for there are many words<note type="footnote" n="c" place="opposite">c Prepositions and conjunctions are specially meant</note> which serve as joints connecting the limbs of the sentence, and these cannot be formed by any use of simile—of these we have to model images for constant employment; but a memory for things is the special property of the orator—this we can imprint on our minds by a skilful arrangement of the several masks that represent them, so that we may grasp ideas by means of images and their order by means of localities. <note type="margin" n="360">360</note> Nor is it true, as unscientific people assert, that memory is crushed beneath a weight of images and even what might have been retained by nature unassisted is obscured; for I have myself met eminent people with almost superhuman powers of memory, Charmadas at Athens and Metrodorus of Scepsis in Asia, who is said to be still living, each of whom used to say that he wrote down things he wanted to remember in certain' localities ' in his possession by means of images, just as if he were inscribing letters on wax. It follows that

this practice cannot be used to draw out the memory if no memory has been given to us by nature, but it can undoubtedly summon it to come forth if it is in hiding.

Debate adjourned to afternoon.</note> " There is a fairly long lecture for you from a person whom I hope you will not think conceited! Though not over-modest I am sure you must think me, for having discoursed at such length on the theory of rhetoric before an audience including not only you, Catulus, but also Lucius Crassus—for no doubt I was right in not troubling so much about hearers of the age of our friends here.

    more admiration for your energy and industry, and at the same time I rejoice in the confirmation of my own conviction, which I have always held, that no one can achieve high distinction for wisdom and eloquence without a very great amount of zeal and industry and study. But all the same, what exactly did you mean by saying that we should forgive you if we knew the motive that had led you to deliver a discourse? What other motive can it be except a desire to oblige us and to satisfy the interest of these young people, who have given you a most attentive hearing? "
    <note type="margin" n="364">364</note> " Oh," he replied, " I wanted to deprive Crassus of all excuse for crying off, having noticed a little earlier that he was too modest, or too reluctant—for in regard to such an agreeable person I will not say too fastidious—about entering on this kind of debate. For what will he be able to say? That he is a person who has held the offices of consul and of censor? We can make the same plea. Or will he adduce his age? He is four<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a Actually three, see p. xiii n. a; but 110 B.C. would be spoken of as the fourth year after 143.</note> years our junior. Or that he does not know these subjects? Why, I took them up late and casually and as an occupation for odd moments, as the phrase is, whereas our friend has studied them from boyhood with the greatest industry and under the best masters. I will say nothing about his ability, which nobody has ever rivalled: in fact whereas no one who has heard me speaking has ever held so low an opinion of himself as not to hope he was capable of speaking better, or at all events as well, when Crassus speaks nobody was ever so conceited as to believe that he would ever speak as well. Therefore, so that these distinguished gentlemen may not have come here to no purpose, let us at last, Crassus, hear you."

" Granted, Antonius," rejoined Crassus, " that I allow something to be the case which is in reality quite otherwise, what pray have you to-day left to me, or to anybody, that can possibly be said? For, my very good friends, I will give you my true opinion: I have heard learned persons often—why do I say ' often '? rather let me say ' occasionally,' for how could I possibly have heard them often, having gone to the bar as I did while a mere lad, and having never had a longer absence from it than my period of office as quaestor? but be that as it may, I have, as I was saying yesterday, heard very learned men, both when I was at Athens, and in Asia your Metrodorus of Scepsis himself, discussing these very subjects; but nevertheless I have never thought that anybody discoursed with greater fullness or with greater penetration in this class of debate than our friend here to-day; and even if this were not the case, and if I detected some point that Antonius had passed over, I should not be so uncivil and I may say so inhuman as to make a difficulty about what I feel to be your strong desire."
    <note type="margin" n="366">366</note> " Have you then forgotten, Crassus," rejoined Sulpicius, " the apportionment arranged with you by Antonius, for him to expound the speaker's stock-in-trade himself while he left its elaboration and embel lishment to you? "
    Hereupon, " In the first place," said Crassus, " who gave Antonius leave to divide the subject up into shares and himself to have the first choice? And next, if I understood him rightly, listening as I was with great pleasure, he seemed to me to be discussing both the two subjects conjointly."
    " As a matter of fact," said Cotta, " he did not

<pb n="479"/>

<p>
touch on the embellishment of oratory, nor the accomplishment from which eloquence has derived its name."
" If that is so," said Crassus, " Antony left the words to me and took the matter for himself."
    <note type="margin" n="367">367</note> " If he left you the harder part," interposed Caesar, " we have good reason for wanting to hear you, and if the part he left you is the easier one, you have no reason for refusing."
    And Catulus said, " What about your promise, Crassus, that if we stayed on at your house to-day you would gratify our wish? Don't you think you are bound in honour to do so? "
    " I might possibly give way to you, Crassus," rejoined Cotta with a smile, " but mind we don't have Catulus introducing a point of moral obligation; this is a job for a censor's attention, but mind how it can be proper for a former censor to commit it."
    " Oh well," said Crassus, " do as you please. But now, seeing what the time is, I move that the house do adjourn for a rest; and if it is agreeable to you we will say something in the afternoon, unless perhaps you would prefer to postpone it till to-morrow."
    They all said they wanted to hear him at once, or at all events, if he himself preferred the afternoon, as early as possible.
