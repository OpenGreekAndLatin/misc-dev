    <p>This collection of Cicero's " Letters to his Friends " was preserved and edited by his secretary Tiro. The collection is
     inadequately entitled, as it includes several letters, some of them of profound interest, from his friends to Cicero. There
     are 426 letters, divided into sixteen books, not arranged in any sort of order,<note type="footnote" n="a">a The confusion
      thus caused is to some extent obviated by a summary, in chronological order, prefixed to each volume, of the events in each
      year covered by the Letters.</note> chronological or otherwise, except that letters from or to particular correspondents are
     generally grouped together; the third book, for instance, consists exclusively of letters from Cicero to Appius Claudius
     Pulcher, and the eighth book of letters from Marcus Caelius Rufus to Cicero. 1 The earliest letter is one from Cicero to
     Pompey (x. 7) dated 62 B. C., the year after Cicero's consulship; the latest is one from him to Cassius (xii. 10) written in
     43 B. C., the year after the assassination of Caesar, and a few months before his own. These nineteen years from 62 to 43 B.
     C., cover a period of supreme importance in the history of the Roman Republic—a period more minutely described and vividly
     illustrated in these letters, giving us as they do the different points of view of various correspondents, than even in the "
     Letters to Atticus," written by Cicero alone. </p>
    <pb n="x"/>

    <p>The Letters vary greatly in interest and style; while many of them contain matter of the highest literary or historical
     value—as, for instance, Cicero's explanation of his political change of front (i. 9), Sulpicius Rufus's letter of condolence
     to Cicero on the death of his daughter Tullia (iv. 5) and Matius's defence of his friendship for Caesar (xi. 28)—others are
     no more than merely formal documents. The text is based on that of Nobbe (1849); but where there was an obvious call for
     emendation in that text I have not hesitated to adopt other readings, always with due acknowledgement. Such universally
     accepted orthographical corrections as cum for quum, consili for consilii, and causa for caussa I have made as a matter of
     course. To Tyrrell and Purser's exhaustive (it has rightly been described as " monumental") Commentary on the Correspondence
     of Cicero<note type="footnote" n="a">a Referred to in my notes for the sake of brevity as "Tyrrell."</note> I have made
     constant reference, and owe more than I can tell; I have depended upon it, too, for the dates of the letters. Watson's Select
     Letters (with the recently revised edition by Mr. W. W. How), and Pritchard and Bernard's Selected Letters for the use of
     Schools have been of invaluable assistance to me, and I have freely consulted the admirable translations of all or some of
     the letters by E. S. Shuckburgh, G. E. Jeans, and S. H. Jeyes. To all the above distinguished Ciceronians I acknowledge with
     gratitude my very deep indebtedness. </p>

    <p>The oldest and soundest ms. of the Epistulae ad Familiares is the Codex Mediceus 49. 9, now in the Laurentian Library at
     Florence. This is known as M. Other MSS., each giving some of the letters, are: G, Codex Harleianus 2773, in the British
     Museum. R, Codex Parisianus 17812, in the Bibliothèque Nationale. (G and Rare closely connected, and both independent of M.)
     T, Codex Turonensis 688, in the Library of Tours. 'H, Codex Harleianus 2682, in the British Museum. F, Codex Erfurtensis, now
     Berolinensis, 252, which closely follows H. D, Codex Palatinus, originally at Heidelberg, now in the Vatican. Of these M
     alone contains all the Epistulae ad Familiares, G, R, and T giving different portions of Bks. I. to VIII., and H, F, and D of
     Bks. IX. to XVI. </p>

    <ab><title>A CHRONOLOGICAL SUMMARY OF THE PRINCIPAL EVENTS IN THE LIFE OF CICERO</title></ab>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="column" n="1">
     <ab>

    </div>

    <div type="textpart">
     <p>
      <lb/>63 B. C. <lb/>§ 1. Cicero, being now consul, successfully opposes the agrarian law of the tribune P. Servilius Rullus,
      which was in the interests of Caesar and Crassus, and </p>

     <pb n="xiii"/>

     <ab><title>CHRONOLOGICAL SUMMARY</title></ab>
     <p>intended to check the growing power of Pompey. Caesar is elected Pontifex Maximus. Cicero carries in the Senate the
      proposal of a supplicatio of unusual length to Pompey in honour of his eastern triumphs. <lb/>§ 2. Having conciliated his
      colleague C. Antonius by resigning to him the governorship in 62 of the rich province of Macedonia, Cicero felt himself able
      in the autumn of 63 to oppose the treasonable designs of L. Sergius Catilina, of which he had full information from the spy,
      L. Curius. In the consular elections for 62 Catiline was again defeated. On October 21 Cicero foretold the rising of the
      Catilinarian Manlius in Etruria on the 27th. Martial law was proclaimed, and the conspirators failed in an attempt to seize
      Praeneste on November 1, and another plot to murder Cicero was exposed. But Catiline had the audacity to appear in the
      Senate on November 8, when Cicero so crushingly denounced him that he left Rome to take command of the insurgents in
      Etruria. <lb/>§ 3. Certain envoys of the Allobroges, having been approached by the conspirators to supply Catiline with
      cavalry, were arrested, and on the strength of incriminating letters found upon them the following five conspirators were
      seized and imprisoned — P. Lentulus Sura (praetor), C. Cethegus (senator), L. Statilius, P. Gabinius Cimber, and M.
      Caeparius; and at a meeting of the Senate on December 5, mainly at the instance of M. Cato, though Caesar, then praetor
      elect, was opposed to it, a decree was carried that the five conspirators arrested should be put to death, and that same
      evening they were strangled under Cicero's supervision. </p>
     <pb n="xiv"/>

     <p><lb/>§ 4. On December 29 the tribune Q. Metellus Nepos vetoed Cicero's address to the people on going out of office,
      alleging that " he had put citizens to death without a trial "; but Cicero's declaration that he had thereby saved his
      country was received with applause. This Metellus was one of Pompey's officers and was probably instigated by his general,
      who was chagrined that Cicero, and not he, should have quelled the conspiracy. <lb/>62 B. C. Consuls: D. Junius Silanus and
      L. Licinius Murena <lb/>§ 1. Catiline, making for Cisalpine Gaul with Manlius's army, is met by Metellus Celer and thrown
      back on the army of C. Antonius. In a battle near Pistoria the insurgents were utterly and finally defeated, and Catiline
      slain. <lb/>§ 2. Cicero resents Pompey's lukewarm appreciation of his services to the Republic (v. 7). <lb/>§ 3. In December
      P. Claudius Pulcher, commonly known as Clodius, " one of the most profligate characters of a profligate age," disguised as a
      female musician profaned the mysteries of the Bona Dea, which were being celebrated by Roman matrons at the house of Caesar.
      He was discovered and brought to trial in 61. <lb/>61 B. C. Consuls: M. Pupius Piso and M. Valerius Messalla Niger <lb/>§ 1.
      Pompey, having returned from the east and disbanded his army in the preceding December, </p>
     <pb n="xv"/>

     <p>addressed the Roman people in January of this year, but failed to create a good impression. He disapproved of the bill for
      Clodius's prosecution, and being distrusted by the extremists in the Senate, found himself so isolated that he made
      overtures to Cicero. <lb/>§ 2. The consul Pupius Piso also opposed the bill for an inquiry into Clodius's affair, but the
      trial ultimately came on, with the result that by means of the grossest bribery Clodius was acquitted. Cicero had given
      evidence cancelling an alibi put up by Clodius, who swore to be avenged upon him, and proved to be a formidable foe, owing
      to his family connexions, and his influence over the city populace. <lb/>60 B. C. Consuls: L. Afranius and Q. Caecilius
      Metellus Celer <lb/>§1. Led by the consul Metellus Celer, now at enmity with Pompey for having divorced his half-sister
      Mucia, the Senate, by obstinately opposing Pompey's plans in Asia and grants of land to his veterans, completely alienated
      him, and by refusing all concessions to the publicani in Asia offended the equites from among whom the publicani were mainly
      drawn. Pompey was ultimately forced into a coalition with Caesar, who returned to Rome in June to canvass for the
      consulship, which by the aid of Pompey and Crassus he secured. <lb/>§ 2. The optimates, however, brought about by bribery
      the election as Caesar's colleague of</p>
     <pb n="xvi"/>

     <p>M. Calpurnius Bibulus, a staunch aristocrat, but a fainéant consul. <lb/>§ 3. Caesar, having effected the reconciliation
      of Pompey and Crassus, now invited Cicero to join them, but he preferred to retain his independence, and the coalition
      (incorrectly called the first triumvirate) of Caesar, Pompey, and Crassus, to which he might have belonged, was established
      without him. <lb/>59 B. C. Consuls: C. Julius Caesar and M. Calpurnius Bibulus <lb/>§ 1. Caesar, having failed to carry
      through the Senate an agrarian law providing inter alia for Pompey's veterans, brought another law before the assembly of
      the people distributing the ager Campanus among those veterans, and this law was carried despite the opposition of the
      consul Bibulus and some of the tribunes. <lb/>§ 2. P. Vatinius, one of the most unprincipled men of the time, was a humble
      hireling of Caesar, and now as tribune he carried the famous Lex Vatinia, which gave Caesar the command of Cisalpine Gaul
      and Illyricum with three legions for five years; and the Senate, on the motion of Pompey (now, by his marriage with Julia,
      Caesar's son-in-law), added Transalpine Gaul to his command, with a fourth legion. <lb/>§ 3. In March Cicero, in defending
      his former colleague C. Antonius, who was accused of extortion as proconsul of Macedonia, attacked the triumvirate, causing
      grave offence to Caesar, who immediately </p>
     <pb n="xvii"/>

     <p>retaliated by sanctioning the adoption into a plebeian family of Cicero's enemy Clodius, thus making him eligible for the
      tribunate, where he would be in a stronger position to wreak his vengeance on Cicero. <lb/>58 B. C. Consuls: L. Calpurnius
      Piso Caesoninus and Aulus Gabinius <lb/>§ 1. Clodius, who had been elected tribune in the preceding October, having carried
      some very popular measures in January, further established his position in February by promulgating a law assigning to the
      consuls on their going out of office the provinces they most desired—Syria to Gabinius, and Macedonia with Achaia to
      Piso,—but he made the law contingent upon the passing of two other measures which were subsequently carried—(1) a commission
      giving to Cato the annexation of Cyprus, and (2) an enactment " that anyone who had put Roman citizens to death without a
      trial should be forbidden fire and water." <lb/>§ 2. Cicero, realizing that the enactment was aimed at himself, put on
      mourning and threw himself on the mercy of the people. The senators and equites also went into mourning, but were compelled
      by an edict of the consuls to dress as usual. Caesar stated in public that he thought Cicero had acted illegally in putting
      Lentulus Sura to death, and Pompey, on being appealed to, referred Cicero to the consuls, who had already shown their
      hostility. Finally Cicero, at the instance of his family and Hortensius, left Rome and went into exile at the end of March.
      He was immediately declared an outlaw by Clodius, </p>
     <pb n="xviii"/>

     <p>and his house on the Palatine and villas at Formiae and Tusculum were pillaged and dismantled., t § 3. Cicero went to
      Brundisium and thenee to Thessaloniea, where he sojourned for seven months at the house of his friend, the quaestor Cn.
      Plancius. As the year went on the situation at Rome became brighter for him; Clodius had offended Pompey by aiding the
      escape from Rome of the Armenian prince Tigranes whom Pompey had captured, by defeating the consul Gabinius in a street
      riot, and even forcing Pompey to shut himself up in his house. Moreover, Lentulus Spinther, one of the consuls elected, was
      personally devoted to Cicero, and the other, Metellus Nepos, a friend of Pompey; while among the new tribunes T. Annius
      Milo, T. Fadius, and P. Sestius strenuously advocated Cicero's recall. His son-in,-law also, C. Calpurnius Piso, who had
      married Cicero's daughter Tullia in 63, and was now quaestor, exercised what influence he had in the interests of his
      father-in-law. <lb/>57 B. C. Consuls: P. Cornelius Lentulus Spinther and Q. Caecilius Metellus Nepos <lb/>§ 1. No sooner had
      the consul Lentulus entered into office on January 1 than he brought before the Senate, with the approval of Pompey, the
      question of Cicero's recall; and despite the obstruction of two of the tribunes, the people, led by Fabricius and all the
      praetors (except Appius Claudius Pulcher, Clodius's brother), passed in their Assembly (the comitia centuriata) on January
      23 a provisional decree recalling Cicero. The Senate thanked Cn. Plancius and others for sheltering Cicero in his. </p>
     <pb n="xix"/>

     <p>banishment, and summoned the Italians to vote finally for his recall in the Assembly, and the bill was carried with
      enthusiastic unanimity on August 4, the voters being protected from Clodius and his armed ruffians by troops under the
      command of Milo. <lb/> 2. Cicero, who had come down to Dyrrachium in the preceding autumn, now crossed over to Brundisium,
      where he was informed by his brother Quintus of the passing of the decree for his recall, and, after a triumphal progress
      homeward, re-entered Rome amid universal rejoicings on September 4. <lb/>§ 3. Later on, on the motion of Cicero, Pompey is
      granted the imperium in the form of the control of the corn supply (curatio rei annonariae) for five years; and on the
      expiry of their terms of office Lentulus receives Cilicia, and Nepos Hither Spain, as his province. <lb/>§4. Ptolemy Auletes
      (the Flute-player), king of Egypt, father of Cleopatra, having been expelled by his subjects, comes to seek the assistance
      of Rome, and the Senate decrees that his restoration should be entrusted to the next governor of Cilicia, i.e. the then
      consul, Lentulus Spinther. <lb/>56 B. C. Consuls: Cn. Cornelius Lentulus Marcellinus, who supported the optimates and
      opposed the triumvirs; and L. Marcius Philippus, who later married Atia, widow of C. Octavius, and, so became the stepfather
      of Augustus <lb/>§ 1. In January the question of the restoration of Ptolemy Auletes is reopened and hotly debated in the
      Senate, and Cicero sends Lentulus, now proconsul of Cilicia, a full account of the voting. Pompey, </p>
     <pb n="xx"/>

     <p>though ostensibly supporting the claims of Lentulus to effect the restoration, was anxious to secure for himself a
      commission which would not only be highly lucrative, but would give him a fleet, an army, and a base in Egypt. Cicero felt
      bound to support his benefactor Lentulus, and the majority of the Senate were afraid or jealous of Pompey, when, very
      opportunely for them, the tribune C. Cato discovered a Sibylline oracle, forbidding the restoration of Ptolemy by anyone cum
      multitudine hominum (" with a host of men "). This is the religio referred to in Bk. i. 2 and 3. The wranglings in the
      Senate ended in no settlement, but Ptolemy was ultimately restored by A. Gabinius in 55. <lb/>§ 2. Clodius, who still lorded
      it in the streets of Rome, escaped being prosecuted by Milo by being elected curule aedile, and turned the tables on Milo by
      accusing him in February of vis (breach of the peace). Pompey, when defending Milo, was shouted down by Clodius's ruffians,
      who declared that Crassus, and not Pompey, should restore Ptolemy. This led Pompey to suspect that Crassus was aiding and
      abetting the rioters. The result of the trial was the closer alliance of Pompey and Milo, and the more definite support of
      Clodius by the extreme aristocrats—Curio, Bibulus, Favonius, and others. <lb/>§ 3. Later in February, Cicero, in defending
      P. Sestius, who had strongly favoured his recall, and was now accused of vis, made his speech (as Watson describes it) " a
      regular political manifesto," and converted his interrogatio (cross-examination) of P. Vatinius, now a witness for the
      prosecution, into a bitter attack upon him as the author of the Lex Vatinia in 59 (see 59 B. C., § 2). The acquittal </p>
     <pb n="xxi"/>

     <p>of Sestius encouraged Cicero to hope for the restoration of the Republic, or at any rate the dissolution of the coalition,
      Pompey being still at feud with Crassus (§ 2) and jealous of Caesar. <lb/>§ 4. Cicero therefore, partly with a view of
      widening the breach between Pompey and Caesar, proposed the suspension of Caesar's law about the ager Campanus (see 59 B.
      C., § 1) on the grounds that the State could not afford any more allotments. This would not affect Pompey, whose veterans
      had already been provided for, whereas Caesar would be precluded from using the remaining land for his own veterans. He also
      saw that the repeal of the agrarian law would be followed by that of the Vatinian. <lb/>§ 5. Having therefore previously
      interviewed Crassus at Ravenna, Caesar took him with him to join Pompey at Luca, a town of Liguria in N. Italy; and here the
      coalition of 60 (see 60 B. C., § 3) was not only renewed but developed into an omnipotent triumvirate who could settle the
      affairs of the State at their own discretion. <lb/>§ 6. This to Cicero, the Republican, and lifelong advocate of concordia
      ordinum (" the harmony of the senatorial and equestrian orders "), was a crushing political calamity, but he had to bow to
      the inevitable, and the famous letter 9 in Bk. I. is his apologia for his change of front. Withdrawing his motion on the
      ager Campanus, he supported a motion in the Senate to provide pay for Caesar's troops and allowing him to appoint ten
      legati. This was followed by his brilliant speech De provinciis consularibus, practically a panegyric upon Caesar and his
      achievements in Gaul. </p>

     <p><lb/>§ 7. Clodius's turbulence in 56-57 had estranged Pompey, who now leaned to the side of Milo, but the extreme
      optimates (including M. Cato, who was indebted to Clodius for a commission to settle the affairs of Cyprus in 58) showed
      such fulsome partiality for Clodius, that Cicero, being earnestly requested by Caesar, whom he could not now disobey, to
      undertake the defence of Vatinius, whom he particularly detested, adroitly converted his predicament into a means of
      annoying the optimates saying that " if they coquetted with one Publius (viz. Clodius), he would coquet with another Publius
      (viz. Vatinius) by way of reprisal" (ii 9- 19). <lb/>55 B. C. Consuls (after an " interregnum " in January caused by the
      tribune C. Cato): Cn. Pompeius and M. Licinius Crassus, both for the second time, having been consuls together in 70 <lb/>§
      1. Crassus carries his Lex Licinia for the suppression of sodalicia (" political combinations "). Pompey opens his new
      theatre with shows of unparalleled magnificence, but his wholesale slaughter of elephants disgusts not only Cicero, but the
      people generally. <lb/>§ 2. Cicero finishes his De oratore. Crassus sets out for Syria, and his departure, together with the
      death of Pompey's wife Julia, Caesar's daughter, put an end to even the semblance of friendship between Pompey and Caesar.
      <lb/>§ 3. Gabinius marches into Egypt, occupies Alexandria, and restores the ex-king Ptolemy Auletes. . </p>
     <pb n="xxiii"/>

     <p><lb/>54 B. C. Consuls: L. Domitius Ahenobarbus, an optimate, who married M. Cato's sister Porcia, and fell at Pharsalia in
      48, and Appius Claudius Pulcher <lb/>§ 1. Cicero helps to secure the acquittal of his former enemy, P. Vatinius, who
      requited his kindness after Pharsalia and later, and at Pompey's instance defends, though unsuccessfully, his former enemy,
      A. Gabinius; and also defends successfully his old friend Cn. Plancius, charged with ambitus, in his famous speech Pro
      Plancio. <lb/>§ 2. His brother, Q. Cicero, goes over from Pompey to Caesar as his legate, and serves him with distinction in
      Britain and Gaul; and this leads to a rapprochement between Cicero and Caesar. <lb/>53 B. C. Consuls, after disorder lasting
      till July: Cn. Domitius Calvinus and M. Valerius Messalla Defeat and murder of M. Crassus in June, near Carrhae. Cicero is
      more deeply affected by the death, a little earlier, of M. Crassus's son. Publius (v. 8. 4). Cicero succeeds Crassus as
      augur, and supports Milo's candidature for the consulship, recommending him to C. Scribonius Curio, to whom he writes a
      series of letters (ii. 1-7) <lb/>52 B. C. About the middle of January Clodius is slain near Bovillae by the retainers of
      Milo: his body is burned by his supporters in the forum, when the senate-house caught fire and was destroyed; martial law </p>
     <pb n="xxiv"/>

     <p>is proclaimed, and finally Pompey is made sole consul, being allowed to retain the government of Spain. Milo is accused of
      vis and condemned. He goes into exile at Massilia. <lb/>51 B. C. Consuls: Servius Sulpicius Rufus and M. Claudius Marcellus
      Cicero goes to Cilicia as proconsul, succeeding Appius Claudius, who had succeeded Lentulus in 54, and M. Calpurnius Bibulus
      goes to Syria. Cicero is kept fully informed of what occurs in Rome by his friend M. Caelius Rufus (Bk. VIII. of these
      Letters). <lb/>50 B. C. Consuls: C. Claudius Marcellus, cousin of the consul for 51, and L. Aemilius Paullus <lb/>§ 1.
      Cicero, after a satisfactory tenure of office, quits his province, leaving C. Caelius Caldus, his quaestor, in charge, and
      reaches Rome in December. He is anxious about the honours due to his Cilician successes, having so far only had a
      supplicatio voted him, but no triumph; he is also embarrassed about the marriage of his daughter Tullia with P. Cornelius
      Dolabella, who was prosecuting for treason Appius Claudius Pulcher, with whom Cicero desired a reconciliation. <lb/>§ 2. A
      motion in the Senate, that Caesar's candidature for the consulship should be considered in his absence, having been
      rejected, the tribune Scribonius Curio demands the disbanding of Pompey's army, which the Senate would have passed but for </p>
     <pb n="xxv"/>

     <p>the opposition of the consul Marcellus. Curio openly declares for Caesar, whom he joins at Ravenna, thus, according to
      Lucan, turning the scales against the Pompeian party (momentumque fuit mutatus Curio rerum). <lb/>49 B. C. Consuls: L.
      Cornelius Lentulus Crus and C. Claudius Marcellus, cousin of his namesake, the consul for 50, and brother of the consul for
      51 The tribunes M. Antonius and Q. Cassius, accompanied by Caelius Rufus, leave Rome and join Caesar, who on January 11
      crosses the Rubicon, and thereby declares war upon the Republic, and marching southwards finally besieges Pompey in
      Brundisium. On March 17 Pompey escapes to Dyrrachium, whither the consuls had gone with the bulk of his army on March 4.
      Cicero vacillates as to his future policy, but finally decides to throw in his lot with Pompey. <lb/>48 B. C. Consuls: C.
      Julius Caesar (for the second time) and P. Servilius Isauricus Cicero spends the first half of the year in Pompey's camp at
      Dyrrachium, where he conceives a poor opinion of Pompey's army; he is still there when he hears of the utter defeat of
      Pompey by Caesar near Pharsalus on August 7 and his flight to Egypt. Crossing with the Pompeians from Dyrrachium to Corcyra,
      Cicero is threatened with death by young Cn. Pompey for refusing to take the command as senior consular. In October he
      returns to Italy and settles in Brundisium. </p>
     <pb n="xxvi"/>

     <p><lb/>47 B. C. Consuls: Q. Fufius Calenus and P. Vatinius, but only for Oct., Nov., and Dec. <lb/>§ 1. Though allowed to
      remain in Italy when all other Pompeians were driven out, Cicero was not happy; he had broken with his brother Quintus, and
      Terentia (he alleged) had mismanaged his financial affairs in his absence; while Dolabella, his son-in-law, was so
      notoriously unfaithful to Tullia as to make a divorce inevitable. <lb/>§ 2. He was consoled, however, by a reassuring letter
      from Caesar in Egypt, who permitted him to retain his lictors and the title of imperator; on Caesar's return Cicero met him
      and was cordially received, and being given leave to live wherever he liked, he chose Tusculum, so as to be near Rome.
      <lb/>§ 3. Dolabella, now tribune, agitating for the abolition of debts, is opposed by his colleague, Trebellius, and the
      ensuing riots had to be quelled by troops under M. Antonius. <lb/>§ 4. Towards the end of the year, through Caesar's
      influence, Q. Fufius Calenus and P. Vatinius are elected consuls. <lb/>46 B. C. Consuls: C. Julius Caesar (third time) and
      M. Aemilius Lepidus <lb/>§ 1. Caesar defeats the Pompeian army under Scipio at Thapsus in Africa, and M. Cato, preferring
      death to slavery, commits suicide at Utica. Returning to Rome and celebrating four triumphs in. August </p>
     <pb n="xxvii"/>

     <p>for his victories-in Gaul, Egypt, Pontus, and Africa, Caesar is made Dictator for the year. §2. Cicero's letters now show
      a more cheerful spirit; he had now divorced Terentia, and after a short interval married his young and wealthy ward,
      Publilia; the marriage, however, was an unhappy one. <lb/>§ 3. Cicero wrote this year his Partitiones oratoriae, Brutus, and
      Orator. <lb/>45 B. C. Consul (fourth time): C. Julius Caesar <lb/>§ 1. In February Tullia, shortly after her divorce from
      Dolabella, died in childbed. Cicero, who had loved her devotedly, refused to be comforted and sought refuge in the solitude
      of Astura. <lb/>§ 2.. Caesar now openly aimed at monarchy, and Cicero especially resented, as an insult to the senatorial
      order, the election as consul for one day of Caninius Rebilus. <lb/>44 B. C. <lb/>§ 1. Caesar, now consul for the fifth time
      and dictator for the fourth, had already by his arrogance and ill-concealed ambition aroused the opposition of the
      republicans, and a conspiracy had long been maturing which culminated in his assassination on March 15 at the foot of
      Pompey's statue in the senate-house. By his will he adopted C. Octavius and made him his chief heir. <lb/>§ 2. On the 17th,
      at a meeting of the Senate in the temple of Tellus, Cicero proposed an amnesty, which the Senate passed, but at the same
      time ratified all Caesar's acts. After this he retired into private life for six months. </p>

     <p><lb/>§ S. He had already completed his Tusculan Disputations and De natura deorum, and during the remainder of the year
      composed his De amicitia, De senectute, De officiis, and several other works. <lb/>43 B. C. Consuls: C. Vibius Pansa and A.
      Hirtius After a series of events too complicated even to summarize here,<note type="footnote" n="a">a A full note on the
       Cisalpine Campaign will be found at the beginning of Book X.</note> C. Octavius, by then called Octavianus, formed a
      triumvirate with Antony and Lepidus, who removed their chief opponents by proscriptio. Among the proscribed was Cicero, who
      was slain on December 7, when he was approaching the end of his sixty-fourth year. </p>

       when he urged the recall of Cicero from exile. He was proconsul of Cilicia from 56 to 53. During the Civil War he was a
       staunch Pompeian.</note> WITH HEARTIEST GREETINGS FROM M. TULLIUS CICERO</p>
     <p>Rome, January 13, 56 B.C.</p>
     <p>In any such dutiful, or rather affectionate, regard <note type="margin" n="1">1</note> as I show you I satisfy the world;
      myself I can never satisfy. Such is the magnitude of your services to me, that when I think how you gave yourself no rest in
      what concerned me until you had fully achieved your purpose, while I have no such success on your behalf, I feel that life
      is embittered to me. The reasons are these: Ammonius, the king's <note type="footnote" n="b">b Ptolemy XII., nicknamed
       Auletes (the Flute-player), king of Egypt, having been expelled by his subjects, appealed to the Roman Senate in 57 to
       restore him. The Senate were disposed to do so, but had to decide between rival candidates for the office of reinstating
       him. Lentulus, to whom this letter is addressed, should nave been appointed to do so ex officio as proconsul of Cilicia,
       but Pompey, though ostensibly supporting Lentulus, coveted the commission for himself. The Senate, though generally opposed
       to Pompey's claims, shrank from downright refusal; but, opportunely for them, the tribune C. Cato produced a Sibylline
       oracle forbidding the restoration of Ptolemy " by the employment of a host of men " (cum multitudine hominum), which gave
       them a pretext for not commissioning Pompey, who already held the imperium. This is the religio referred to in this and the
       next letter. Cicero favoured the plea of religio in the interests of Lentulus; the orator, Q. Hortensius, his great rival
       in the forum, and M. Licinius Lucullus, who acted as Pontifex Maximus for Caesar in 57, supported him, because they wished
       to keep out Pompey. The whole question was ultimately shelved by a resolution (auctoritas) of the Senate, forbidding the
       restoration altogether. Ptolemy, however, was restored in 55 by A. Gabinius for a bribe of 10,000 talents.</note> repre- </p>

     <p> EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, I. I. sentative, makes no secret of countering us by means of bribery; the business is being
      managed with the aid of those very financiers who advanced the money for it when you were in Rome. Any—and they are but
      few—who are well disposed to the king, are unanimous in wishing that the matter should be put in Pompey's hands, while the
      Senate accepts the fictitious plea of religious scruples, not for any reason of religion, but it is jealous of Pompey, and
      disgusted at the king's lavish bribery. As regards Pompey, I never cease urging and imploring <note type="margin" n="2"

      repeatedly done so), nothing can induce him to give it up. What has happened up to the 13th of January (I am <note

     <p> we are in favour of your being authorized to restore the king, " so far as you can do so without detriment to the state
      "; so that while the religious difficulty eliminates the army, the Senate retains you to manage the whole affair. Crassus
      votes for three commissioners, not excluding Pompey, for he extends the selection even to those who happen to be in the
      enjoyment of imperium.<note type="footnote" n="a">a Pompey held the imperium ("imperial command of naval and military
       forces”) by virtue of his office as curator annonae " (" Controller of the Corn Supply ") to which he had been appointed on

      no imperium. The other consulars agree with Bibulus, excepting Servilius, who declares that there ought to be no restoration
      at all; and Volcatius, who, on the motion of Lupus, votes for the appointment of Pompey; and Afranius, who agrees with
      Volcatius. And this increases the suspicion that Pompey desires the appointment, for it was noticed that his friends agreed

     <p> Nothing was settled in the Senate on January 13, <note type="margin" n="1">1</note> because a great part of the day was
      taken up with a dispute between the consul Lentulus<note type="footnote" n="a">a Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus Marcellinus,
       referred to as Marcellinus in the preceding letter. He was consul in 56 with Lucius Marcius Philippus.</note> and the
      tribune Caninius. I, too, spoke a good deal on that day, and appeared to make a great impression on the Senate by insisting
      on your goodwill towards it. So on the following day we resolved to be brief in expressing our opinions, for it seemed that
      the Senate had again become favourably inclined to us; of this I had assured myself not only in the course of my speech, but
      when I appealed to individual members, and asked for their support. And so when Bibulus's motion " that three commissioners
      should restore the king" was first read out for discussion, and then, Hortensius's, " that you should restore him, but
      without an army," and thirdly Volcatius's, " that Pompey should restore him," a demand was made that Bibulus's motion should
      be submitted in two parts.<note type="footnote" n="b">b Viz. (1) Shall the army be eliminated, in accordance with the

     <p> Hortensius's motion came next, when the tribune <note type="margin" n="2">2</note> Lupus, on the ground that it was he
      who had raised the question affecting Pompey, began to insist that he should take precedence of the consuls in dividing the
       house.<note type="footnote" n="a">a i.e. that his motion to appoint Pompey should be taken first.</note> His speech was
      answered by angry shouts of dissent on every side, for it was as unfair as it was unprecedented. The consuls neither yielded
      to him nor showed any spirit in opposing him; what they wanted was, that the day should be wasted, and that is what
      happened; for though they openly paraded their agreement with Volcatius, they saw clearly enough that a far greater number
      would vote for Hortensius's motion. Large numbers were asked their opinion, and that too with no objection on the part of
      the consuls, for they were anxious that Bibulus's motion should succeed. This dispute dragged on <note type="margin" n="3"
       >3</note> till nightfall, and then the Senate was dismissed. On that day I happened to dine at Pompey's house, and availing
      myself of a more favourable opportunity than I had ever had before (for since you left Rome my prestige in the Senate had
      never been higher than on that day) I spoke to him in such a way that I think I drew his mind away from every other line of
      thought to a due consideration of your claims. And when I hear him speak himself, I acquit him absolutely of any suspicion
      of selfish greed; but when I look round at his intimate friends of whatever rank, I clearly perceive what must now be patent
      to all, that your whole case has long since been basely betrayed by certain people with the connivance of the king himself
      and his counsellors. I write this on the 15th of January, before dawn; <note type="margin" n="4">4</note> to-day there is to

      conventional formality. Farewell. IV TO THE SAME Rome, January, 56 B.C. On the fifteenth of January we brilliantly
      maintained <note type="margin" n="1">1</note> our position in the Senate; we had already on the preceding day given the coup
      de grâce to that motion of Bibulus concerning the three commissioners, and the only subject of controversy left over was
      Volcatius's motion, though the opposition spun the affair out by various pettifogging objections. We upheld our cause in a
      full house, in spite of the same endless variety of arguments and the undisguised jealousy of those <note type="footnote"

       Gabinia, the whole time of the Senate during February had to be devoted to receiving and discussing deputations
       (legationes) from the provinces or foreign states. Thus there could be no meeting of the Senate for ordinary purposes

      plea of religious scruples, falsely so called, was introduced by your envious calumniators, not so much to hamper you in
      particular, as to prevent anyone's wishing to go to Alexandria from a selfish desire for military command. But as to your
      own claims, everyone considers that all proper regard has been paid them by the Senate; for everyone is aware that the fact
      that no division took place is due to the machinations of your opponents; if, however, they now attempt to carry any measure
      on the alleged grounds of serving the people, but in reality because of the infamous villainy of the tribunes, I have taken

      of your deserts? Or why, on the other hand, deplore the injurious acts of others at the cost of bitter anguish to myself? I
      can guarantee your cause no protection against violence, especially now that the magistrates are so powerless; but apart
      from that I can assure you that the enthusiastic support of the Senate and the people of Rome will enable you to maintain
      your distinguished position unimpaired. Farewell. </p>

      of abuse, and again harshly and offensively called to account in the Senate by Cato,6 while his friends uttered no word of
      protest, and he seemed to me to be profoundly agitated. So it looks as though he has entirely dropped the Alexandrine
      business, which, so far as we are concerned, is as it was; for the Senate has deducted nothing from your claims except what,
      for the same religious reasons, can be granted to nobody else. What I now hope for, what I am striving to bring <note
       n="marg">2</note> about, is that the king, when he understands that he cannot manage to be restored, as he had intended, by
      Pompey, and that, unless he is reinstated through your agency, he will be a pariah and an outcast, should come and visit
      you; and that is what he unquestionably will do, if Pompey gives the slightest hint that he has no objection: but you know
      how dilatory and reserved our friend is. Still we are leaving nothing undone which is relevant to the matter. All the other
      injurious proposals of Cato, <note type="footnote" n="b">b C. Porcius Cato; see the preceding letter, § 2, note a.</note> we

     <p> VII TO THE SAME Rome, end of August, 56 B.C. I have read your letter, in which you tell me that <note type="margin" n="1"
       >1</note> you are pleased because I keep you so regularly informed on all matters, and you can easily see my goodwill to
      you. As to the latter, it is essential that I should prove my sincere affection for you if I would be the man you would have
      me be; as for the letter-writing it is a pleasure to me, so that widely separated as we now are by time and space, I may
      converse with you as often as possible by correspondence. And if I do so less frequently than you expect, the reason will be
      that my letters are not of such a nature that I can entrust them in a casual way to anybody. Whenever I can get hold of
      trustworthy men in whose hands I can properly put them, I shall not miss the opportunity. You want to know how each man
      stands in the <note type="margin" n="2">2</note> matter of loyalty and friendly feeling towards yourself: well, it is hard
      to speak of particular persons. There is one fact, however—I have often hinted it to you before—which, now that all has been
      thoroughly sifted and investigated, I venture to set down here too, and that is that certain persons, and those most of all
      who most of all ought to have supported you, and could have done so to the greatest extent, have conceived an inordinate
      jealousy of your position, and that, though the cases are different, there has appeared a close analogy between the present
      crisis in your affairs and the past crisis in mine; for while the men you had fallen foul of in the interests of the state,
      attacked you openly, those whose ascendancy, </p>

     <p> position, and policy you had defended, were not so mindful of your merits, as resentful of your renown. At that time, as
      I wrote in detail to you before, I found Hortensius unreservedly your friend, Lucullus devoted to your cause, and L.
       Racilius,<note type="footnote" n="a">a Tribune of the plebs in 59 B.C.</note> among the magistrates, exceptionally loyal
      and well-disposed; for my own defence and vindication of your claims might perhaps, in view of your extraordinary generosity

      I cannot testify as to the zeal or <note type="margin" n="3">3</note> deference or friendliness of any single one of the
      consulars, for Pompey, who very often talks to me about you, not only when I lead him on to do so, but even of his own
      accord, did not, as you know, often attend the Senate on those occasions; but your last letter to him, as I could easily
      understand, gave him very great pleasure. To me your considerate courtesy, or rather your consummate wisdom, seemed as
      charming as it was wonderful. Here is an excellent man whom you had laid under an obligation to you by an act of remarkable
      generosity, but who had his suspicions that because of what certain persons thought of his eagerness for office you were
      estranged from him—this man's friendship, by the writing of that letter, you have retained. He has always, I believe,
      favoured your high reputation even in those very dubious days of Caninius's <note type="footnote" n="b">b L. Caninius

     <p> to you after frequent conversations with him and with his approval and authority, and what I say is this,— that, since no
      decree of the Senate exists whereby the restoration of the king of Alexandria is taken out of your hands, and that the
      resolution which was drafted (and you know it was vetoed) " that nobody at all should restore the king " has so little force
      that it seems to be the ex parte outburst of a few angry men, rather than the deliberate measure of a sober Senate, in that
      case you, who hold Cilicia and Cyprus,<note type="footnote" n="a">a Cyprus was annexed to Cilicia in 58 B.C.</note> can
      clearly estimate what you can achieve and attain; and if circumstances seem likely to give you the opportunity of holding
      Alexandria and Egypt, it is not inconsistent with your own dignity and that of our Empire that you should put the king in
      Ptolemais or some neighbouring spot and proceed with fleet and army to Alexandria, so that when you have pacified and
      garrisoned that town, Ptolemy may return to his kingdom; and so it will come about that he will be reinstated through your
      agency, just as the Senate originally decided, and that he will be reinstated " without a host " as was the intention
      (according to the religious party) of the Sibyl. But he and I, in approving this decision, did not <note type="margin" n="5"

      hope and pray it will, everybody will say you acted with wisdom and courage; if there be any hitch, the same people will say
      you acted with greed and rashness. And so it is not so easy for us to judge how far you may succeed, as it is for you, who
      have Egypt almost before your eyes. What we feel is this, that if you have quite satisfied yourself that you can take

     <p> hesitate to do so; if there is any doubt about it, you must not make the attempt. Of this I can assure you, that if you
      carry out your enterprise to your satisfaction, you will be applauded before your return by many, and after your return by
      all; but I can see that any mishap will be fraught with danger because the resolution and the religious difficulty have been
      brought in. But for my part, while I press you to undertake what cannot fail to bring you glory, I warn you against
      incurring any conflict, and I return to what I wrote at the beginning of my letter, that men will base their judgement of
      your whole enterprise, not so much on your policy as on the result. But if this plan of procedure in the business seems
       <note type="margin" n="6">6</note> to you to be dangerous, another course commends itself to us, that if the king has kept
      faith with those friends of yours who have lent him sums of money throughout your province and the provinces under your
      command, you should assist him with your troops and supplies, knowing that the nature and geographical position of your
      province is such, that you would either secure his return by assisting him, or hinder it by ignoring him. How far the
      circumstances, the cause itself, and the course of events, bear upon this project, nobody will estimate so easily and
      exactly as yourself; what our opinion was, I thought that I, of all men, was the proper person to tell you. You congratulate

      depart from the old political principles I have so long maintained, not indeed so far as to show forgetfulness of my
      dignity, but so far as to have some regard (and it is time I should) for my personal safety as well. Both objects might have
      been excellently secured were there any staunchness or solidity of character to be found in men of consular rank; but in
      most of them to such a degree is the reverse to be found that they are not so much pleased with the steadfastness of my
      public conduct as annoyed by its distinction. I write thus to you all the more frankly, because <note type="margin" n="8"

      what was practically the birth in the old days of my subsequent reputation and ascendancy; and at the same time because I

      too (and you are the noblest of the noble) I have noticed similar manifestations of malice on the part of the envious, and
      while it is true that they had no objection at all to your being one of our leading men, they certainly resented any higher

     <p> much am I influenced by the promptings of my heart, and, I emphatically add, my friendly feeling towards Pompey, that
      what is expedient to him and what he desires, now appear to me in every case right and proper; and, to my thinking, even his
      opponents would make no mistake, if, seeing they could be no match for him, they were to call a truce. I have myself this
      further consolation, that I am <note type="margin" n="3">3</note> the kind of man whose decision would be accepted by
      everybody with the warmest approval, whether it were to support what Pompey advocates, or to keep silent, or even (as is my
      particular inclination) to return to my former literary pursuits, and this last I shall undoubtedly do,if my friendship for
      Pompey permits me. For what had once been my aim and object after I had discharged the most honourable public offices and
      completed my very arduous labours—the dignified deliverance of my opinions in the Senate, and an independent position in
      dealing with public affairs—that I have lost for ever, and I not more than anybody else; for we must either utterly

     <p> IX M. CICERO TO P. LENTULUS, IMPERATOR <note type="footnote" n="a">a This celebrated letter, which teems with interest
       for the student of Cicero's political life, was written in 54 B.C., when, as Mr. How puts it, " Pompey still ruled Rome as
       best he could, and Cicero acquiesced, in his supremacy, still unconscious that it might be hereafter challenged by Caesar.
       His complete acceptance of the position is shown by his laboured defence of his conduct" in this letter. It is an ἀπολογία,
       for his change of political front rather than a παλινῳδία, for that had already appeared either in his speech De provinciis
       consularibus, or else in some more direct communication to Caesar of which we have no record. As to his personal relations
       to the Triumvirate, he had always been a friendly admirer of Pompey, he was drawn closer to Caesar by the latter's
       generosity to himself and intimacy with his brother Quintus, now on Caesar's staff, and he had even become reconciled,
       superficially at least, with the triumvir he had always hated, M. Crassus.</note> Rome, December, 54 B.C. I was very much
      pleased with your letter, which <note type="margin" n="1">1</note> made me realize that you fully appreciate my devotion to
      you; for why should I say " my goodwill " when even that term " devotion " itself, most solemn and sacred as it is, does not
      seem to me impressive enough to describe my obligation to you? But when you write that you are grateful to me for my
      exertions on your behalf, by a sort of overflow of affection you represent those acts, which could not be omitted without
      perpetrating an atrocious crime, as actually deserving of gratitude. My feelings towards you, however, would have been
      better recognized and more marked, if all this time during which we have been separated we had been together and at Rome.
      For in that very line of action you plainly declare <note type="margin" n="2">2</note> that you will adopt—no man is better
      qualified to do so, and I eagerly look to you to do so—I mean in speaking in the Senate, and in every sphere of public life
      and political administration, we should have made our mark (what is my own feeling and position in politics I shall explain
      a little later, and at the same time reply to your questions); at any rate I should have found in you a supporter most
      kindly and most wise, and you in me a counsellor </p>

      undoubtedly you would have been able to enjoy the fruits of my indebtedness to you in richer abundance and to greater

      you so valiantly fought for my recall, in others to be envious of you because you won so much honour and glory by that
      achievement, I should have proved myself a marvellously efficient coadjutor—though that never-failing foe of his own
      friends, <note type="footnote" n="b">b The person thus stigmatized is most probably the tribune, C. Cato, who had proposed
       Lentulus's recall from Cilicia, and otherwise behaved outrageously. It can hardly be Appius Claudius Pulcher, with whom
       just below (§ 4) Cicero records the renewal of his friendship, still less can it be Pompey, the whole letter being Cicero's
       defence of his reconciliation with the triumvirs.</note> who, though you honoured him by doing him the greatest kindnesses,
      concentrated upon you of all people his maimed and emasculated violence, has done our work for us and punished himself; Ins

      lesson from my experience alone, and not from your own also, still I am glad that, annoyed as you must be, you have tested
      at not so very great a cost the worth of men's loyalty, which I had tested at the price of the bitterest anguish. But as to
      the significance of the whole affair, I think I have now an opportunity of so making my explanation as to reply at the same
      time to your questions. You write that you have been informed by letter <note type="margin" n="4">4</note> that I am on good

     <p> as regards Vatinius, <note type="footnote" n="a">a P. Vatinius, a political adventurer, and no less of a scoundrel (as he
       himself maintained) than P. Clodius, was quaestor in 63 and tribune in 59, when he sold his services to Caesar, then consul
       with Bibulus, and proposed the Lex Vatinia, giving Caesar Cisalpine Gaul and Illyricum for five years. In 56 he witnessed
       against Cicero's friends, Milo and Sestius, and was vehemently attacked by the orator. In 55 he was praetor, and in 54 was
       accused of bribery by Licinius Calvus, and defended, as explained here, by Cicero. He was consul suffectus for a few days
       at the end of 47. In 46 he was fairly successful as governor of Illyricum (cf. v. 10 a and 10 b). After Caesar's death he
       was compelled to surrender Dyrrhachium and his army to Brutus.</note> however, you clearly indicate your desire to know
      what induced me to defend and eulogize him. To give you a plainer explanation of this it is necessary that I should go a
      little further back into the reasons of my policy. At the beginning, <note type="footnote" n="b">b i.e. " of my
       restoration."</note> thanks to the course of events and to your exertions, my dear Lentulus, I imagined that I had been
      restored not to my friends alone but to the commonwealth, and that while to you I owed an almost incredible affection and
      every act of extreme and peculiar devotion to yourself, to the Republic, seeing that it had aided you greatly in my
      restoration, I considered that, by reason of its own deserving, I assuredly owed a regard such as previously I had displayed
      as owing to it because of the common obligation of all citizens, and not because of any signal service done to myself. That
      I was of this mind the Senate was told by my own lips in your consulship, and you yourself must have observed it in our
      conversations and interviews. And yet even in those early days there were <note type="margin" n="5">5</note> many things
      that caused me heart-burnings, when, as you were dealing with the general aspects of my position in the state, I detected
      signs either of the covert hatred of certain persons, or of their doubtful support of my cause. For neither in the matter of
      my memorial buildings <note type="footnote" n="c">c " Cicero may here refer (1) to his own house or a portion of it, (2) to
       the neighbouring colonnade of Catulus, destroyed by Clodius, but rebuilt by the Senate's order, (3) or perhaps to some

      private property, I regarded as comparatively of little importance—I mean that patching up of my pecuniary losses, under a
      vote of the Senate—did they evince that sympathy which I had expected. But though I noticed all this (and nobody could help
      noticing it), still the annoyance I felt at those incidents was outweighed by my gratitude for what they had done in the
      past. And so, although I was enormously indebted, as you <note type="margin" n="6">6</note> yourself have asseverated and
      testified, to Pompey, and was devoted to him not only for his services to me,' but also because I love him and cannot change

      and victories of them all; and before the same man, in another part of my speech, I declared that those who prevented
      Bibulus from leaving his house, and those who forced me to leave mine, were the same persons. Indeed the whole of my

      more uncompromisingly invaded the very stronghold of the triumvirs' party, or more completely forgotten the days of my
      trouble and recalled the days of my power? The result of this expression of my opinion was a highly excited state of mind

      roused his hot indignation against me. It was common knowledge that Pompey was greatly annoyed at my proposal, as I had been
      told by others, but most particularly by my brother. When Pompey met him in Sardinia a few days after he had left Luca he
      said, " You are the very man I want to see! nothing could have happened more opportunely! Unless you remonstrate seriously
      with your brother, you must pay up what you guaranteed me on his behalf." <note type="footnote" n="c">c Quintus had, morally

      loyal citizens—that though they did not, it is true, exasperate me—I have entirely lost all sense of exasperation—they
      certainly imagined that they did. Atthiscrisis, so far as my human judgement enabled me to do so, having carefully reviewed
      my whole position, and cast up the account, I have arrived at the net result of all my deliberations; and to the best of my

      their cause, no, not though their services to me were proved to be exceptionally great. "When, however, the leading man in
      the state was Gnaeus Pompey, a man who had gained such power and eminence as he has by the highest public services and the
      most brilliant military achievements, one whose public claims I had conspicuously supported from my youth upwards, and as
      conspicuously promoted both in my praetorship and in my consulship: when, moreover, he had himself given me the help of his

      made a slight change in my political attitude, and contributed my moral support to the advancement of a' most illustrious
      man who had laid me under the deepest obligations. In this determination, I was obliged, as you must <note type="margin"
       n="12">12</note> see, to include Caesar, the policy and position of the two men being so intimately connected. Here I
      attached great weight as well to the long-standing friendship, which, as you yourself are aware, my brother Quintus and I
      had with Caesar, as to Caesar's courtesy and generosity, which even in this short time I have recognized and acknowledged
      both in his letters and his acts of kindness to me. I was profoundly influenced too by the interests of the state, which
      seemed to me to demur to any quarrel with those great men, especially after Caesar's extraordinary successes, and indeed
      emphatically to forbid it. But what impelled me most strongly to come to this decision was Pompey's having pledged his word
      for me to Caesar, and my brother's having pledged his to Pompey. Moreover, in a matter affecting the state, I could not but
      mark the inspired words in the writings of my master Plato " as are the leaders in a commonwealth, so are the other citizens
      apt to be." <note type="footnote" n="a">a Plato, Laws, iv. 711 c.</note> I well remembered that in my consulship from the
      very first day of January such a foundation had been laid for the strengthening of the Senate, that nobody should have been

      ''your' parents." <note type="footnote" n="a">a Crito 51 c βιάζεσθαι δ' οὐχ ὅσιον οὔτε μητέρα οὔτε πατέρα, πολὺ δὲ τούτων

      finding the people of Athens now almost in a state of dotage, <note type="footnote" n="b">b Plat. Ep. 5, 322 Α, Β Πλάτων ὀψὲ

      argument nor by anything but force, while he despaired of their being persuaded, he did not deem it lawful that they should
      be forced. My own position was different, inasmuch as my people were not in their dotage, and not being free to choose
      whether I should engage in politics or not, my hands were tied; but I rejoiced none the less that in one and the same cause

     <p> Added to these inducements was the notable and even greater than human generosity shown to my brother and myself by
      Caesar—Caesar, who might have claimed my support whatever he might undertake to do; as it is, so extraordinary is his
      success and so brilliant are his victories, that even were he not what he is to me, I should deem him worthy of all honour.
      For what I would have you believe is this, that apart from yourself and others to whom I owe my restoration, there is nobody
      in the world to whose kind offices I am so deeply indebted, and I not only confess it, but I am actually glad of it. And now
      that I have explained this to you, what <note type="margin" n="19">19</note> you ask me about Vatinius and Crassus is easily
      answered. In Appius's case you write that, just as in the case of Caesar, you have no fault to find, and I am glad that the
      line I took meets with your approval. Now as to Vatinius. Immediately on his election as praetor, a reconciliation had been
      brought about between us, in the first instance by the intervention of Pompey, though it is true that I had opposed
      Vatinius's candidature in the most scathing terms in the Senate, but not so much with the object of injuring him, as of
      defending and doing honour to Cato. Upon this there followed a surprisingly urgent request on the part of Caesar that I
      should undertake Vatinius's defence.<note type="footnote" n="a">a When in 54 he was accused by C. Licinius Calvus of having

      and always will be, praised by me also. However, in the matter of Vatinius's defence, I had another motive to spur me on; as
      I remarked at the trial when I was pleading for him, I was doing just what the Parasite urged the Captain to do in the
      Eunuchus <note type="footnote" n="a">a Ter. Eun. iii. 1. 50. Cicero means that he is playing off his Publius (Vatinius)
       against the optimates' Publius (Clodius), exactly as the parasite, Gnatho, advises the captain, Thraso, to play off
       Pamphila against his mistress's lover, Phaedria (see Introd. 54 B.C. § 7).</note>: When Phaedria's name she utters, you'll
      reply Promptly with Pamphila's; and should she cry " Let us bid Phaedria to our revelling! " " Let's challenge Pamphila,"
      you'll retort, " to sing." His looks if she praise, praise you hers no less; Such tit-for-tat will cause her deep distress.
      So I begged the gentlemen of the jury, since certain noble friends of mine, who had shown me the greatest kindness in tin;
      past, were now evincing an undue affection for my special enemy, and before my very eyes were constantly either drawing him
      aside, as if for solemn consultation, or else playing " hail fellow well met " with him, since they had their Publius, I
      begged the jury, I say, to allow me, too, another Publius of my own, in dealing with whom I might give my friends'
      conscience a sly dig or two just to show that I was a little annoyed with them; and I not only said so, but I do so again
      and again, to the delight of gods and men. So much for Vatinius; now let me tell you about <note type="margin" n="20"

      defence without any abuse of myself. But when on my arguing the case he attacked me without provocation, well, then I
      flashed out; it was not, I think, the irritation of the moment only (for that would probably have been less violent), no,
      but that pent-up rancour due to the many wrongs he had done me, a rancour of which I imagined I had completely purged my
      soul, had yet settled there without my knowing it, and suddenly revealed itself in all its bitterness. And at this very time
      certain persons, indeed those very men whom I often hint at but do not name, though they declared that they had benefited
      very greatly by my outspoken manner, and that they considered that episode to be my first real restoration to the Republic
      as my old self again, and though my quarrel with Crassus had proved of great benefit to me even among the outside public,
      those same people now declared that they were delighted that he was at enmity with me, and that those <note type="footnote"

      never strove before to bring about my reconciliation with Crassus, and when Caesar plainly showed by his letter that that
      passage-at-arms had caused him intense annoyance—why, then I took into account not only my circumstances, but also the

      far as I have any part in them. And on that point I should like you to be firmly convinced of this—that those are precisely
      the sentiments I should have entertained had I been entirely uncommitted and had a free hand; for I should still have been
      of opinion that no resistance, should be offered to powers so invincible, that the established pre-eminence of our highest

      opinion when the circumstances have entirely altered and the political inclinations of honest men have undergone a

     <p> reach your desired destination; on the same principle in the conduct of state affairs, while we should all have as our
      one aim and object what I have so repeatedly preached—the maintenance of peace with honour—it does not follow that we ought
      always to express ourselves in the same way, though we ought always to have in view the same goal. And therefore, as I
      stated a little while ago, even were I absolutely untrammelled in my choice, I should be in politics no other than I now am.
      But attracted as I am by the kindnesses of some and impelled by the malicious conduct of others into this way of thinking, I
      see no objection to my feeling and saying on political questions whatever I consider most conducive both to my own interests
      and those of the state; and I do so all the more openly and frequently because my brother Quintus is on Caesar's staff, and
      because no single word of mine, however trivial, much less any action has passed in Caesar's favour, which he <note
       type="footnote" n="a">a Caesar, not Quintus.</note> has not welcomed with a gratitude so clearly expressed as to make me
      feel that he is sincerely obliged to me. This enables me to enjoy as though they were my own the advantages both of his
      influence, which is very powerful, and of his pecuniary resources which, as you know, are very great; indeed I fail to see
      how otherwise I could have wrecked the intrigues against me of unprincipled scoundrels, than by combining with the

      everybody in the world, yes, and by all generations to come. Appius has now made a public declaration in the <note
       type="margin" n="25">25</note> Senate of what he used often to assert before in private conversation, " that if he were
      allowed to get a law through the comitia curiata he would cast lots with his colleague for their respective provinces, but
      that if no such law were passed, he would come to an arrangement with his colleague and become your successor in Cilicia;
      that the passing of such a law in the comitia curiata, while formally important for a consul, is not indispensable; and that
      holding the province as he did by a decree of the Senate, he would hold imperium also under the law of Sulla, until such
      time as he entered the city." <note type="footnote" n="a">a What Appius Claudius Pulcher, consul this year (54) with L.
       Domitius Ahenobarbus, seems to mean is this: " If before my year is out I can get a Lex Curiata (i.e. a formal ratification
       of my proconsular imperium by the people), well and good; I shall follow the ordinary procedure and draw lots with my
       colleague for our provinces next year. If, however, such a Lex Curiata is (as so often happens) vetoed by a tribune, I
       shall make shift to do without it, and arrange with my colleague to take the province which suits me best, i.e. Cilicia. A
       consul may very well dispense with a Lex Curiata, which is practically superseded by the Lex Cornelia (Sulla's law de
       provinciis ordinandis), a law which makes no reference to a Lex Curiata, and provides, among other things, for the
       retention by a provincial governor of his proconsular imperium up to the day he re-enters Rome—a provision which has its
       potentialities." And Cicero evidently thinks that Appius would be legally justified.</note> What your several friends and
      relations write to you about it respectively I cannot tell; I only know that opinions differ. There is a certain section who
      think you would be within your rights in not resigning your province, because, as they say, your successor's appointment
      lacks the sanction of a law passed in the comitia curiata. There are others, too, who think that, if you do retire, you can
      leave behind you a representative in charge of the province. I am myself not so sure of the legal point (though that is not
      so very doubtful either), as I am of this, that it is due to your exalted position, your dignity, and your kindness (the
      exercise of which I know is a great and constant satisfaction to you), to </p>

      read <note type="margin" n="26">26</note> yours about the publicani<note type="footnote" n="a">a The farmers of the public

      them, I could wish that you had managed by some happy dexterity to avoid falling foul of the interests or inclinations of a
      department you have always honoured. For my part I shall not cease to defend your decrees, but you know the traditions of
      that class of men; and you remember what bitter enemies they proved themselves to the great Q. Scaevola <note
       type="footnote" n="b">b Quintus Mucius Scaevola, when governor of Asia in . 99 B. C., endeavoured to protect the
       provincials from the extortions of the publicani, thereby offending the equites.</note> himself. At all events I strongly
      advise you, if by any means you can do so, either to effect a reconciliation with that department, or to mitigate their
      resentment. It is a difficult problem, but I am sure you are shrewd enough to solve it. <note type="footnote" n="c">c Or "I

       n="d">d L. Valerius was an intimate and dear friend of Cicero, but, though a jurisconsult, he was " no lawyer " (cf, iii.
       1. 3). He was now in Cilicia, and had asked Cicero to write on his behalf to Lentulus, the then proconsul, but Cicero tells
       him he had much better come home, and banters him on his attempt to set up as " learned in the law " in the
       province.</note> Rome, 54 B. C. [Cicero greets L. Valerius, " learned in the law "]— for I really don't see why I should
      not flatter you to that extent, especially since in these days one may safely put impudence in the place of erudition. </p>

      my letter of recommendation, but to come and see us again after all this time, and prefer to reside where you are of some

      taste. But I am really longing to have a merry chat with you tête à tête. So be sure you come as soon as possible, and leave

       he was bought over by Caesar, and Lucan says of him that he turned the scales in the civil war (Chron. Sum. for 50 B.C.).
       His career was not unlike that of his intimate friend M. Caelius Rufus, whom he also resembled in character. He was

     <p> IV TO THE SAME Rome, 53 B.C. That there are many kinds of letters you are well <note type="margin" n="1">1</note> aware;
      there is one kind, however, about which there can be no mistake,—for indeed letter-writing was invented just in order that
      we might inform those at a distance if there were anything which it was important for them or for ourselves that they should
      know. A letter of this kind you will of course not expect from me; for as regards your own affairs you have your
      correspondents and messengers at home, while as regards mine there is absolutely no news to tell you. There remain two kinds
      of letters which have a great charm for me, the one intimate and humorous, the other austere and serious. Which of the two
      it least beseems me to employ, I do not quite see. Am I to jest with you by letter? On my oath, I don't think there is a
      citizen in existence who can laugh in these days. Or am I to write something more serious? What is there that can possibly
      be written by Cicero to Curio, in the serious style, except on public affairs? Ah! but in this regard my case is just this,
      that I dare not write what I feel, and I am not inclined to write what I don't feel. And so, since there is no subject left
      me for a <note n="marg">2</note> letter, I shall fall back upon my usual peroration, and exhort you to an earnest quest of

     <p> so universal is the decay, indeed I may almost say, the destruction of our public interests. But I am not sure that it is
      safe to have entrusted to a letter even what I have just written; so you will be told all the rest by others. As to yourself
      however, whether you have some hope left of the Republic, or whether you have none, be prepared with such aspirations and
      projects as ought to find room in the heart of that citizen, that hero, who is destined to rescue the State, prostrated and

      Sextus Villius, the intimate friend of my friend Milo, to you with this letter. Still, since it was supposed that you would
      arrive very shortly, and there was no doubt that you had set out from Asia en route for Rome, the matter was so pressing
      that I was not afraid of being in too great a hurry in dispatching the letter, as I was extremely anxious that it should
      reach you at the earliest possible moment. If, my dear Curio, there were nothing to be considered but my services to

     <p> appealing to you had I some important request to make. A man of any modesty finds it repugnant to address such a petition

      unprecedented misfortunes have made them stand out in a strong and clear light, and since it is the mark of a generous
      disposition to wish to owe most to whom you owe much, I have not hesitated to ask you by letter to do something for me which
      is more important and more indispensable to me than anything else in the world. For I have never been afraid of being
      overwhelmed by your services to me, numberless as they are, especially as I felt confident that there was no favour you
      could do me which my heart could not find room for in the acceptance of it, or fail to recompense abundantly, and even to

     <p> him so much that we should not need any further assistance. All these points are in our favour—the active support of the
      loyalists, which his tribunate won for him, as I hope you understand, on account of his defence of my cause, the support of
      the man in the street, on account of the magnificence of his public shows and the generosity of his disposition, the support
      of the young citizens, and of men of influence in securing votes, due to his own outstanding popularity, or it may be his
      assiduity in that connexion, and lastly, my own electoral support, which, though not so powerful as the above, has at any
      rate been tested and is only right and no more than his due, and on those grounds perhaps not without influence. What we
      want is a leader, and a man of moral <note type="margin" n="4">4</note> weight, and a sort of controller and as it were a
      steersman to avail himself of those winds I have just described; and had we to choose one man in the wide world, we should
      have nobody we could compare with you. And for that reason, if you can regard me (and you can) as being not unmindful or
      ungrateful for a kindness, and as an honest man, if only for my strenuous exertions on Milo's behalf, if in short you deem
      me worthy of your beneficence (and you do), well, then what I ask you to do is just tins— to relieve my present anxiety, and
      to devote your zeal to the defence of my reputation, or, to speak more accurately, of what is almost my personal safety in

     <p> and I get my news late. But I do congratulate you, and earnestly pray that your tribunate may redound to your everlasting
      honour; and I exhort you to let yourself be guided and controlled in all things by your own common sense, and not be carried
      away by the proposals of others. There is nobody who can give you sounder advice than yourself; if you listen to yourself,
      you will never slip. I am not writing this in a haphazard way; I understand to whom I am writing; I know your spirit, I know
      your sagacity, I am not afraid of your showing either timidity or stupidity in anything you do, if only you maintain what

      which you have—no, not stumbled, but stepped; for it was by deliberate choice and by no accident that you flung your
      tribunate into the very crisis of things; and I doubt not that you reflect how potent in politics is opportunity, how
      shifting the phases, how incalculable the issues, of events, how easily swayed are men's predilections, what pitfalls there
      are and what insincerity in life. But I beg of you, do not let your thoughts and anxieties take a new direction, but do just
      what I suggested at the beginning of my letter, have a talk with yourself, invite yourself to a consultation; give ear, and
      no deaf ear, to yourself; the man who can give better advice than you can to another, is far to seek; the man who will give
      better to yourself, does not exist. Ye everlasting Gods! why am I not at your elbow, to be the spectator of your exploits,

      any negligence on my part; but because I know nothing at all of what is going on. For I am here in a district where news

      fact that I have not received a single epistle from you since that splendid election of yours which threw me into ecstasies
      of delight; consequently I fear that my own letters may meet with the same fate. I assure you I have never sent home a
      single communication without its being accompanied by another to yourself; why, to me you are the dearest and most

      ordinary, homely words I use? And yet they do fail me, and for this reason—I am extraordinarily anxious as to what on earth
      may be decreed about the provinces. It is surprising how I yearn for Rome; you cannot believe how I yearn for my friends,
      and particularly for you; but as to the province, I am heartily sick of it, whether it be because I seem, to have attained
      such a measure of fame, that I should not so much seek any addition to it, as apprehend a reverse of fortune, or because the
      whole business is unworthy of my powers, seeing that I can, and often do, carry heavier burdens in the service of the state;
      or because we have hanging over us the horror of a great war, which I seem likely to escape if I quit the province on the

      they do not reach me), but they are charming; to take only the last I got, how shrewd it was, how packed with kindness and
      good advice! Though I had already decided that I should have to act in every respect as you advise, I am none the less
      fortified in my intentions by the feeling that men of discernment and my faithful counsellors hold the same views. For

      as I have often remarked in my <note type="margin" n="2">2</note> conversations with you, I have a profound regard, and as
      soon as we buried the hatchet I felt that I had begun to win his regard. When consul he was prompt to do me honour, as a
      friend he is charming, and he takes an interest in what interests me. That I, on the other hand, never failed in my good
      services to him, you yourself can testify; and now I think I have the added testimony of Phania, <note type="footnote" n="c"
       >c Phania seems to have been an intimate friend of Cicero and an intermediary between him and Appius. Cicero mentions him

      proved his devotion to me? 1 have written more fully on these points because your letter conveyed a slight hint that you had
      a lurking doubt as to my goodwill towards him. I expect you have been hearing something; if you have heard anything, believe
      me, it is a lie. My own measures and policy differ to some extent in their very nature from his ideas of provincial
      administration, with the result that certain folks have perhaps suspected that my disagreement with him is due to the clash
      of incompatible temperaments, and not to a mere difference of opinion. Now I have never either done or said a single thing
      with the intention of disparaging his reputation. Indeed, since this trouble caused by our friend Dolabella's indiscretion,
       <note type="footnote" n="a">a Dolabella was now prosecuting Appius for maiestas.</note> I am putting myself forward as his

     <p> Pompey—I could shed my life-blood for him. But when all is said and done, nothing in the world is more precious to me
      than the Republic herself. And you? you are not making much of a show in that same Republic; being at once a good citizen
      and a good friend, you seem to me to be drawn in two directions. On quitting my province I put my quaestor <note
       type="margin" n="4">4</note> Caelius in command. " A boy like that! " you will say. Yes, but a quaestor; yes, and a youth
      of noble birth; yes, and I followed a practically unbroken precedent, and there was nobody who had held a higher public
      office for me to appoint over his head. Pomptinus <note type="footnote" n="a">a Pomptinus had been propraetor in Transalpine
       Gaul in 62, and in 61 fought so successfully against the, Allobroges that he obtained a triumph. Tyrrell.</note> had left
      long before; my brother Quintus could not be induced to take office; —and besides, had I left him behind me, the maliciously
      disposed would now be saying that I had not as a matter of fact quitted the province at the end of my year, as was the
      intention of the Senate, seeing that I had left behind me a second self. Probably also they would add that the intention of
      the Senate had been that only those should be governors of provinces who had not been governors before; whereas my brother
      had been governor of Asia for three years. In short, I am rid of all anxieties; had I left my brother behind me, I should
      have everything to fear. Lastly, it was not so much on my own initiative as according to the precedent set by the two most
      powerful men in Rome, who have eagerly taken up all the Cassiuses and Antoniuses <note type="footnote" n="b">b Though
       quaestors were properly chosen by lot, Pompey had appointed Q. Cassius to be his quaestor, as Caesar had appointed

      hope of peace, there was nothing I so persistently avoided as civil arms. My consistent conduct in this respect I think I
      shall never have reason to regret. Indeed I remember, that, in discussing such matters, it was a frequent boast of my dear
      friend, Q. Hortensius, that he had never taken part in civil warfare. My credit will be the more conspicuous in so far as in

      in which you hear that I have settled down. But maybe I am only raving, and everything will turn out better than we expect.
      I call to mind the fits of despair to which those folks were subject who were old men when I was a lad: perhaps I am now
      following their example, and indulging the weakness of my age. I hope it may be so; and yet ... I expect you have been told

       Hut inficere has the double meaning of " dyeing " and " corrupting," and Cicero insinuates that Caesar (the infector) had
       bribed Curtius to join him by the promise of an augurship—a promise he is now hesitating to fulfil. Jeans' rendering is
       exceedingly clever " but the person from whom he takes his colour is keeping him waiting."</note> There's a pinch</p>

      doubted before whether they would come; now, if the news that there is peace in Syria is received in time, I am quite sure
      they will not. As to Marius, the successor to the province, I foresee that he will arrive late, because the Senate has
      decreed that he must not travel without the legions. I have answered one of your letters, I now come <note type="margin"

      do so, but this seems a good opportunity for a word or two with you; you are the only man of all Bibulus's suite who never
      informed me how intensely Bibulus disliked me, and that without any apparent cause. It has been reported to me by scores of
      people that when there was great anxiety at Antioch, and great hopes of me and my army, he repeatedly declared that he would
      sooner suffer any hardship than be thought to have stood in need of my assistance; that you were keeping this back about
      your own praetor, from a sense of your duty to him as his quaestor, I did not so much resent, although I heard from time to
      time how you were being treated. But the man himself, when he wrote to Thermus about the Parthian war, never sent me a
      syllable, though he knew perfectly well that it was I who had to bear the brunt of that war. He did write to me, but only in
      reference to his son's augur-ship; and I, out of sheer pity, and because I had always been very friendly with Bibulus, took
      particular pains to write to him as courteously as possible. Now if he is indiscriminately spiteful (and I have <note

      arranged that the exchange of the money should be to the advantage of the people <note type="footnote" n="a">a Whatever

      people. On the other hand, where he himself was solely responsible, he takes me into partnership " When we" quoth he, "
      demanded more corn for the auxiliary cavalry." But what follows is the mark of a petty mind, starved and enfeebled by its'
      own spitefulness—because the Senate gave Ariobarzanus the title of " king" through me, and commended him to me, our friend
      in his dispatch does not speak of him as " king " but as the " son of King Ariobarzanus." To make an appeal to men of that

      and a disgrace it certainly will be, there is no doubt of it; for you have nobody who stands above him in official rank. Now
      that young man, not to mention his nobility, takes precedence of those excellent men of unblemished record, your legates, by
      virtue of the very fact that he is a quaestor, and your own quaestor too. I am quite aware that there is nobody who can harm
      you by being angry. Still I don't like your having three brothers,<note type="footnote" n="b">b The three Antonii mentioned

      period of three years. But, as to the Republic, who knows what sort of <note type="margin" n="3">3</note> weather is in
      store for it? My forecast is " squally." Why should I want you to face the terrors of the tribunes' wrath, especially when
      nobody could say a word against it if you promoted a quaestor over the heads of a quaestor's legates? If he proves himself
      worthy of his ancestors, as I hope and pray he will, the credit in a great measure will be yours; if he makes any mistake,

      Caldus, son of Lucius, grandson of Gaius, Quaestor. When I heard the very welcome news that I had drawn you as my quaestor,
      I hoped that the longer you were with me in the province, the better pleased I should be with that result of the drawing of
      lots; for it seemed to me of great importance that the bond forged between us by the lot should be further strengthened by
      personal intimacy. Later on, when I received no communication as to your arrival either from yourself or from anybody else,
      I began to fear that it would so fall out (and indeed I still fear it), that before you had reached the province I should be
      quitting the province. However, when in camp at Cilicia, I received on June 21, a letter you had sent me, and a most
      courteously worded letter it was, which made it easy for me to form a true estimate both of your sense of duty and your
      capacity. But it gave me no indication either of the place or the date of its dispatch, or of the time I was to expect </p>

     <p> CICERO'S LETTERS TO HIS FRIENDS BOOK III I M. T. CICERO TO APPIUS CLAUDIUS PULCHER IMPERATOR <note type="footnote" n="a"
       >a Appius Claudius Pulcher, brother of Cicero's enemy Clodius, and the notorious Clodia, was praetor in 57, and propraetor
       of Sardinia in 56. In 54 he was consul with L. Domitius Ahenobarbus. In 53 he was proconsul in Cilicia, which he governed
       with ruthless rapacity. Being succeeded in that province by Cicero in 51, on his return to Rome he was impeached by
       Dolabella, but acquitted. In 50 he was censor with L. Piso. In 49 he joined Pompey, but died in Greece before the battle of
       Pharsalia. He was an augur, and dedicated a book on augural discipline to Cicero. All the letters in this Book are
       addressed to him.</note> Rome, 52 B.C. Were the state herself able to give you an account <note type="margin" n="1"
       >1</note> of her present condition, you would not learn it from her more easily than from your freedman Phania; so
      sagacious is he, and not only that, but also (in no unpleasant sense) <note type="footnote" n="b">b Lit. " so far as to be
       pleasing."</note> inquisitive; he will, therefore, make everything plain to you; for that helps me to make my letter
      shorter, and is less risky in view of other matters. Now as regards my goodwill towards you, though you can learn it from
      the lips of that same Phania, I think none the less that I personally have some part to play in the expression of it. You
      must convince yourself that you are very dear to me, both on account of the many charms of your character, your courtesy and
      kindliness, and also because I gather from your letter, and from what many have told me in conversation, that all that has </p>

      wonderful way the courtesy with which you wrote. It was a delight to me to hear him holding forth as he told me all about
      your kindly feeling, and the remarks you made about me day after day. In short, in two days he became my intimate friend—not
      so much so, however, that I am likely to cease missing Phania very much; and talking of Phania, when you send him back to
      Rome, which I imagine you intend to do very soon, I should be glad if you would give him instructions as to everything you
      wish me to do or look after. L. Valerius/ the lawyer, I strongly recommend to <note type="margin" n="3">3</note> you, and
      that too even if he is—well, no lawyer. For I wish to take sounder " precautionary measures " for him than he usually does
      for others. I am very fond of the man; he is of my household, and one of my most intimate friends. He is unfailing in his
      expressions of gratitude to you; but he also writes that what would carry the greatest weight with you is a letter from me.
      I beg of you again and again not to let him be disappointed in that expectation. </p>

       holding office in Rome and taking up the government of a province. That Cicero had no desire for provincial government is
       shown by his resigning the chance of a province after his consulship in 63 (cf. v. 2. 3). In 51, however, the Senate
       decreed that all qualified ex-magistrates who had not yet governed a province must (apparently in order of seniority)
       accept such appointments; and Cicero was thus, twelve years after his consulship, compelled to draw lots for a consular
       province: he drew Cilicia, and his colleague in the consulship, Bibulus, soon after obtained Syria. </note> If, so far as

      that your reputation and prestige are most precious to me. Q. Fabius Vergilianus and C. Flaccus, son of Lucius, and, more

     <p> ing to me, it naturally follows that I should like you to think that it will be, and already is, an urgent charge upon me
      to see to it that, in the first place you and all your people, and secondly the rest of the world also, may be able to
      recognize that I am most friendly disposed towards you; and it seems to me that those who are still not fully convinced of
      it, do not so much fail to understand the fact as object to our being on such friendly terms. But understand it they
      assuredly will: for neither will the characters be insignificant, nor the motives mean in the drama that is to be enacted.
      But I wish the performance of all this to be better than what I say or write. My itinerary seems to have caused you
      considerable <note type="margin" n="3">3</note> doubt as to whether you will see me in the province; well, this is how the
      matter stands. When I spoke with your freedman Phania at Brundisium, I came to a point in the conversation when I said that
      I would willingly come first to that part of the province to which I thought you were most anxious that I should come. Then
      he told me, that since you desired to quit the province on board a fleet, it would be extremely convenient to you if I put
      in to Sida, <note type="footnote" n="a">a A city of Pamphylia, on the coast, W. of the river Melas.</note> a sea-board part
      of the province, with my ships. I said I would do so, and I should have done so, had not our friend L. Clodius told me at
      Corcyra that that was the very last thing I should do; that you would be at Laodicea to meet me on my arrival. That meant a
      much shorter journey and was much more convenient for me, especially as I thought you preferred it so. After that your plans
      were completely altered. <note type="margin" n="4">4</note> As things now stand, it will be easiest for you to decide what
      can be done; what I propose to do </p>

     <p> Ego tibi meum consilium exponam. Pridie Kal. Sextil. puto me Laodiceae fore; ibi perpaucos dies, dum pecunia accipitur,
      quae mihi ex publica permutatione debetur, commorabor. Deinde iter faciam ad exercitum, ut circiter Idus Sextil. putem me ad
      Iconium fore. Sed si quid nunc me fallit in scribendo (procul enim aberam ab re ipsa et a locis), simul ac progredi coepero,
      quam celerrime potero, et quam creberrimis litteris faciam, ut tibi nota sit omnis ratio dierum atque itinerum meorum.
      Oneris tibi imponere nec audeo quidquam nec debeo. Sed, quod tuo commodo fieri possit, utriusque nostrum magni interest, ut
      te videam ante quam decedas. Quam facultatem si quis casus eripuerit, mea tamen in te omnia officia constabunt, non secus ac
      si te vidissem. Tibi de nostris rebus nihil sum ante mandaturus per litteras, quam desperaro coram me tecum agere <note

      eum ego Ephesi vidi, fuitque mecum familiariter triduum illud, quod ego Ephesi commoratus sum, nec ex eo quidquam audivi,
      quod sibi a te mandatum diceret. Ac sane vellem potuisset obsequi voluntati tuae; non enim arbitror noluisse. </p>

     <p> myself I will explain to you. On July 31, I think I shall be at Laodicea, where I shall stay for a very few days, while I
      receive some money due to me on the Treasury Bill of Exchange. <note type="footnote" n="a">a " Cicero would want to get the
       current coin of the province for the money given him for his domestic establishment (vasarium)." Tyrrell.</note> After that
      I shall make my way to the army, so that about August 13 I expect to be in the neighbourhood of Iconium. But if I make any
      mistake at the moment of writing (for 1 am far from what is now going on and the places I mention), as soon as I begin to
      advance, by as speedy and frequent communications as possible I shall ensure your being apprised of the whole programme of
      my dates and routes. As for laying any burden on your shoulders, I have not the courage, nor is it my duty, to do so. But so
      far as is possible without inconvenience to yourself, it is of great importance to each of us that I should see you before
      you leave. Even if any accident snatches the opportunity out of our grasp, still my every duty to you will be performed as
      punctiliously as if I had seen you. It is not my intention to send you any message by letter concerning my affairs until I
      have abandoned all hope of being able to confer with you in person. You say that you requested Scaevola <note
       type="footnote" n="b">b Probably Appius's legatus or quaestor.</note> to take command <note type="margin" n="5">5</note> of
      the province in your absence until my arrival; well, I saw him myself at Ephesus, and he was my intimate companion during
      the three days I stayed at Ephesus, and I got nothing out of him indicating that you had given him any commission at all.
      And I could have heartily wished that he had been able to comply with your desire; for I do not suppose he would have had
      any objection. </p>

     <p> When I compare your action with mine, though I <note type="margin" n="1">1</note> claim no more credit than I give you in
      the matter of maintaining our friendship, still I find far more satisfaction in my own action than in yours. At Brundisium I
      inquired of Phania (whose fidelity to yourself I imagined I had thoroughly understood, as I also imagined I knew the place
      he held in your regard) into what part of the province he supposed you were most anxious that I should come first as your
      successor. He answered that I could do nothing more agreeable to you than make Sida the end of my voyage; now although to
      arrive there involved a loss of dignity, and was in many respects less convenient for me, in spite of all that, I told him
      that I would do so. Again when in Corcyra I met L. Clodius, a man so <note type="margin" n="2">2</note> closely connected
      with you that when I conversed with him it seemed to me that I was conversing with you, I told him that I would make
      arrangements so as to come first to that part of the province winch Phania had specified in his request. And then Clodius,
      when he had thanked me, earnestly begged of me to go straight on to Laodicea, saying that you wished to be in the part of
      the province I could most quickly reach,<note type="footnote" n="a">a Or " on the extreme (westerly) edge of the province."
       Tyrrell.</note> that you might depart most quickly. Indeed, had I not been such a successor as you particularly wished to
      meet, that you would have left before your successor had been appointed; and this certainly tallied with the letter I had </p>

      consilium mutavi, et ad te statim mea manu scriptas litteras misi, quas quidem ex tuis litteris intellexi <note
       type="margin" n="3">3</note> satis mature ad te esse perlatas. Hoc ego meo facto valde delector. Nihil enim potuit fieri
      amantius. Considera nunc vicissim tuum. Non modo ibi non fuisti, ubi me quam primum videre posses, sed eo discessisti, quo
      ego te ne persequi quidem possem triginta diebus, qui tibi ad decedendum lege (ut opinor) Cornelia constituti essent, ut
      tuum factum iis, qui, quo animo inter nos simus, ignorent, alieni hominis (ut lenissime dicam) et fugientis congressum, meum
      vero coniunetissimi et amicissimi esse videatur. <note type="margin" n="4">4</note> Ac mihi tamen ante, quam in provinciam
      venirem, redditae sunt a te litterae, quibus etsi te Tarsum proficisci demonstrabas, tamen mihi non dubiam spem mei
      conveniendi afferebas; cum interea, credo equidem, malevoli homines (late enim patet hoc vitium),<app n="1">
       <note>1 Following Schütz, Graevius, and Manutius, I have omitted et est in multis as being a gloss, though the words are

     <p> received at Rome, which, as I thought, gave me a very clear idea of the hurry you were in to get away. My answer to
      Clodius was that I would do so, and, indeed, much more willingly than if I had been obliged to fulfil my promise to Phania.
      And so I changed my plan and immediately sent you a letter written with my own hand; and I gather from your letter that mine
      was delivered to you in plenty of time. This is that action of mine with which I am so <note type="margin" n="3">3</note>
      thoroughly satisfied; no action could have been more friendly. Now it is your turn to reflect upon your own. Not only were
      you not at the place where you could have had the earliest opportunity of seeing me, but you went off to where I could not
      even catch you up within the thirty days which were fixed, I think, by the Cornelian law <note type="footnote" n="a">a
       Sulla's law, Lex Cornelia de provinciis ordinandis, one of the provisions of which was that the retiring provincial
       governor must leave the province within thirty days after the arrival of the new governor.</note> as the limit of your stay
      in the province; with the result that your conduct appears to those who know nothing of our mutual feelings to be that of a
      stranger, to use the mildest possible term, and of one who wanted to run away from an interview, while mine on the other
      hand appears to be that of one closely attached to you and the best of friends. And yet even before I came to the province,
      a <note type="margin" n="4">4</note> letter from you was handed to me, in which, although you clearly indicated that you
      were setting out for Tarsus, you still gave me no uncertain hope that you would meet me; while in the meantime, I imagine,
      evil-minded persons,—for it is a widespread vice—who had yet got hold of some plausible grounds for their gossip, knowing
      nothing of my staunchness as a friend, were trying to alienate my goodwill from you by alleging that you were holding an
      assize at Tarsus, </p>

     <p> making various enactments, deciding actions, delivering judgements, though you might already have guessed that you had
      been superseded; doing things that were not usually done, they said, even by those who thought that they were being
      succeeded at an early date. Now the talk of these people disturbed me not <note type="margin" n="5">5</note> at all; nay
      more than that (I hope you will believe me) I considered that if you were busying yourself officially, I was being relieved
      of some irksome toil, and I rejoiced that a year's government of the province, a long time as it appeared to me, had now
      been reduced to a government of hardly more than eleven months, if one month's work had been taken off my shoulders before I
      arrived. One thing, to tell you the truth, does disturb me—that, our forces being so weak to start with, three cohorts, and
      those at their fullest strength, are absent, and that I do not know where they are. What annoys me most of all, however, is,
      that I do not know where I shall see you; and I was the less prompt in writing to you, because I have been daily expecting
      to see you in person; and meanwhile I have not received so much as a letter from you to inform me what you were doing or
      where I was likely to see you; so I have sent you D. Antonius, the commander of the veterans,<note type="footnote" n="a">a
       Evocati were men who had served their time in the army " called out " again for service.</note> a gallant officer of whom I
      have reason to think very highly, so that, if it be your pleasure, you may hand the cohorts over to him, in order that I may
      be able to achieve something appreciable while the season of the year is still in my favour. And in that regard both our

     <p> because, as you say, I hindered their building operations by the letter I wrote. In the same despatch also you request me

      come to me? Anyhow what they did was ludicrous; the letter they brought me, asking that it might be possible for them to do
      the work in the summer, that letter they did not put into my hands till after midwinter. But let me tell you firstly, those

       or marshals by magistrates who had the imperium.</note> that you complained in conversing with him that I had not gone to

      to me about the second watch, <note type="footnote" n="b">b Between nine and twelve at night.</note> and reported that you
      would arrive at Iconium before dawn, and that it was not certain by which road (for there were two), I sent Varro, your most

      of them to post away from you to me so as to give me time to come and meet you. Lepta came running to me, and reported that
      you had already passed the Camp. I hastened to Iconium. The rest you already know. Could I have possibly failed to meet you,
      firstly an Appius Claudius, secondly an imperator? Then, since it is an ancient custom, then (and this is the main thing)
      because you were my friend? And that too when in affairs of this kind it is my habit to act with a courtesy far more

     <p> Stoics are right in regarding as a virtue—do you, I ask, suppose that any Appiism or Lentulism in the world weighs more
      with me than the distinctions conferred by virtue? Why, even before I had attained the honours which are most magnificent in
      the eyes of men, yet those names of yours never excited my admiration; no, it was the men who had bequeathed them to you
      that I thought great. But later, when I had so accepted and administered the highest offices of the empire as to feel that I
      had obtained all I desired in the way of both promotion and glory, I hoped that I had become, never, indeed, your superior,
      but, at any rate, your peer. And I declare that I never observed that any different opinion was held either by Cn. Pompey,
      whom I consider a better man than any who has ever existed, or by Lentulus, whom I consider a better man than myself. If you
      think otherwise, you will not go wrong if in order to appreciate the difference between nobility of birth, and nobility of
      worth, you were to study with a little more attention what is said on this subject by Athenodorus, <note type="footnote"

       intolerable burden upon them. This was now the case with the Cilicians, who, though willing to send legates to Rome to
       "commend Appius," found the cost too great, and complained to Cicero. He ordered that any such legates should pay their own
       expenses, and that the towns should not be taxed for the purpose. To this order Appius naturally objected.</note> are
      concerned, what could have been in better taste or more equitable than my action in reducing the expenses of the most
      impecunious states, and that without in any way impairing your dignity, especially when it was done at the urgent request of
      the states themselves? For I was not aware at the time of the general scale of the deputations which were going to Rome on
      your account. When I was at Apamea, the leading men of many states reported to me that the amount of money decreed for the
      expenses was excessive, and that although the states were insolvent. Upon that, many thoughts suggested themselves <note
       n="marg">3</note> to me at once. In the first place, I never supposed that you, a man not only of common-sense, but also
      (to use the modern phrase) of" culture," derived any pleasure from that sort of deputation; and, if I mistake not, I argued
      at some length to that effect when on the bench at Synnada, pointing out firstly, that Appius Claudius had won credit in the
      eyes of the Senate and Roman people not on the strength of the testimony of the inhabitants of Midaeum (that was the state
      in which the matter was mentioned), but by doing what his nature prompted him to do; <note type="footnote" n="b">b " By his

     <p> these deputations being allowed any special time or place to deliver their eulogy; that I was pleased with their
      eagerness to gratify you, because they were grateful to you for your good services, but it seemed to me that the whole
      principle of the thing was quite unjustified by necessity. However, I added, if they .really wished to evince their sense of
      obligation to you by so doing, in that case if anybody should prove to have performed the function at his own expense, I
      should commend him; if the expense to the state were within the limits of the law, I should raise no objection; if it were
      unlimited, I should not allow it. Now what fault can be found with that? Unless it is what you add in your letter, that
      certain people have got the idea that my edict was, so to speak, deliberately framed for the purpose of obstructing those
      deputations of yours. Here, indeed, it appears to me that it is not so much those who argue in this way, that do me wrong,
      as the man who lends a willing ear to such arguments. It was at Rome that I drew up the edict, and <note type="margin" n="4"
       >4</note> I added nothing to it but a clause which the publicani when they visited me in Samos asked me to transfer, word
      for word, from your edict to my own. The paragraph was very carefully drawn up, and relates to the reduction of the expenses
      of the states, and in it are certain innovations to the advantage of the states which give me much satisfaction; but this
      particular clause, which gave birth to the suspicion that I had made diligent search for something to cause you offence, is
      simply a transcript from a previous edict. I really was not so lacking in common-sense, as to imagine that the legates were

      already been constituted. And anyhow there is this also that I would have you know, that I made no decree respecting either

      of my unswerving goodwill towards you, I replied with a touch of temper. When, however, I read the letter you gave my
      freedman Philotimus, I recognized and understood that there were many in the province who were sorry that we entertain such
      feelings towards each other as we do; but when you approached the City, or rather as soon as you saw your friends, you

      letter, " If anything occurs that touches your dignity, although that can hardly happen, still, if it does, I shall do as

      highly delighted with what you say in your letter about your having a hope by no means doubtful, indeed quite certain, of
      obtaining a triumph; not, indeed, for the reason that it would make it easier for me to obtain one myself; that is
      utilitarian philosophy; <note type="footnote" n="a">a The Epicureans held the theory that friendship was based on

      a date as possible. I have been later altogether in sending my dispatch than I could have wished; and in that not only was I

       n="1">1</note> of those who were making trouble for you,<note type="footnote" n="a">a This refers to the impeachment of
       Appius for maiestas by P. Cornelius Dolabella, now the son-in-law of Cicero, whose daughter Tullia he married after
       divorcing his wife Fabia in 51 B.C. He was one of the most profligate men of his time, and the cause of constant uneasiness
       to Cicero. At Pharsalia, and afterwards in Africa and Spain, he fought on the side of Caesar, who in 44 B.C. raised him,
       despite the opposition of Antony, to the consulship. On Caesar's death, however, he joined the republican party, but when
       Antony gave him the province of Syria he became a fierce anti-republican. On his way to 15yria in 43 B.C. he plundered the
       cities of Greece and Asia Minor, and at Smyrna murdered Trebonius, proconsul of Asia. He was declared a public enemy and
       Cassius besieged him in Laodicea, where, to avoid falling into the hands of his enemies, he ordered one of his own soldiers
       to kill him.</note> the first announcement of it seriously disturbed me, since nothing could have happened to cause me
      greater surprise; when I had pulled myself together, however, it seemed to me that the subsequent situation could be very
      easily dealt with, because I had absolute confidence in yourself, and a good deal in your friends, and many considerations
      occurred to me to justify my expectation that all this distress of yours would actually redound to your honour. What caused
      me profound annoyance, was that by this measure of theirs, those who are jealous of you, had robbed you, as I could see, of
      a very sure and well-deserved triumph. But if you attach no more importance to the matter than I have always been convinced
      should be attached to it, you will be acting wisely, and, with the victory on your side, will enjoy in the vexation of your
      enemies the most well-deserved of triumphs. For I clearly foresee, that you, with all your energy, resources, and wisdom,
      will make your enemies bitterly regret their foolhardiness. As regards myself, I call the gods of heaven to witness this my

      Brutus—although in our daily intercourse you might have understood this as you are sure to understand it—but since the

      more ready to break off a longstanding connexion with a man who had undertaken the representation of your enemies than to
      form any fresh connexion with him. You ought to have no doubt as to my devotion to you; it is obvious to everybody in the
      province, and it was obvious at Rome. And yet there is a hint in your letter of a certain <note type="margin" n="6">6</note>
      suspicion and doubt in your mind, about which this is not the right time to expostulate with you, but it is the time to
      clear myself, and I must. When did I ever stand in the way of any deputation being sent to Rome to eulogize you? Or how, if
      I were your public enemy, could I have done less to injure you, if your private enemy, how could I have shown my hostility
      more openly? But supposing I were as treacherous as they who heap such charges on my head, even then I am sure I should not
      have been such a fool as openly to parade my hostilities where I wished to keep my hatred dark, or on the other hand to
      betray an eager desire to do you harm by an act which would do you no harm at all. I remember some people coming to me, it
      must have been from Epictetus, <note type="footnote" n="a">a Phrygia Epictetus (ἐπίκτητος), so called because it had been
       added by the Romans to Pergamus.</note> to inform me that extravagant sums were being voted to meet the expenses of certain
      legates: my reply to them, which was not so much a command as an expression of opinion, was that sums for that purpose
      should be voted as nearly as possible in accordance with the Cornelian law. <note type="footnote" n="b">b The Lex Cornelia,
       enacted by Sulla in 81 B. C., limited the expense the provinces were to be put to for the legati.</note> And as evidence

      desires is entered as paid over to your legates. </p>

      Especially when he has written me such a letter that, had I been your enemy and not your devoted friend, I should have been
      propitiated by it, and submitted myself unreservedly to the wishes, yes, even to the nod, of one who had deserved so well of
      me. But no more on these topics; perhaps I have <note type="margin" n="11">11</note> already dealt with them at unnecessary

       follows here is supposed to have been expunged before these letters were published.</note> . . . And all this that I am
      doing, and intend to do, is in defence of your high position rather than to secure your personal safety. For I hope to hear
      at an early date that you have been elected censor; well, the duties of that magistracy demand very high courage and very
      sound judgement, and I am of opinion that you would do well to give more earnest and careful consideration to those duties

      pravam inimicorum tuorum mentem fuisse mirabar. De ambitu vero quid interest, inquies, an de maiestate? Ad rem nihil.

     <p> I shall therefore reply to the earlier letter first—the letter in which you tell of your acquittal on the charge of
      maiestas. <note type="footnote" n="a">a In full crimen laesae maiestatis populi Romani, applicable not only to acts of
       treason, but to any mismanagement of affairs which affected the public interests.</note> It is true that I had been
      informed about it long before in letters and messages and lastly by the general talk about it, for nothing could have been
      less of a secret—not that anybody could have thought it would have turned out otherwise, but as generally happens, no
      announcement affecting men of conspicuously high reputation can be kept dark—but anyhow your letter added to the pleasure
      which all that news had given me, not only because it spoke more distinctly and in richer detail than the ordinary gossip
      one hears, but because I thought my congratulations were better justified when I listened to you telling me your own story.
      Well then, far away as you were, I threw my arms <note type="margin" n="2">2</note> around you in thought, and I really did
      kiss the letter, and then I congratulated myself too; for any tribute paid by the whole people, the Senate and the jurors to
      capacity, hard work, and integrity—though perhaps I flatter myself in imagining such virtues are to be found in me—I
      consider any such tribute is paid also to myself. But I was not so much surprised at the glorious result of your trial as at
      the distorted mental vision of your enemies. But you will say " bribery and corruption " or maiestas— what is the
      difference? None that really matters; <note type="footnote" n="b">b i.e., as far as you are concerned, for you were guilty

       being a vaguely comprehensive term, including any act whatever derogatory to the dignity, or prejudicial to the interests
       of the Roman people, was a charge easily made and admitting of no very positive defence. Sulla, however, in his Cornelian
       Laws intended it to be at least definite enough to check indiscriminate public vituperation. About ambitus on the other
       hand, there was no vagueness at all; it could be proved or disproved; "and who," says Cicero, "has ever impugned your
       political purity?" As a matter of fact Appius was first accused of maiestas, and, on being acquitted, was shortly
       afterwards accused of ambitus, and again acquitted. Appius implies by his question that he does not care whether he is
       charged with ambitus or maiestas, but Cicero thinks his chance of acquittal would be stronger if he was charged with
       ambitus.</note> whereas " bribery and corruption " is so definite in meaning that either the prosecution or the defence
      must be scandalously false. For how can it fail to be proved whether an act of bribery was or was not committed? But who has
      ever suspected your successive public promotions? How sorry I am that I was not there! How I should have made them laugh!
      But in your letter about your trial on the charge <note type="margin" n="3">3</note> of maiestas there are two passages
      which pleased me exceedingly. One is your writing that your defence was undertaken by the Republic herself; and certainly,
      even if there were an abundant supply of honourable and courageous citizens, it would be her duty to protect such men, but
      all the more at the present time, because so great is the dearth of such men in every official rank, and at every stage of
      life, that, in her destitution the State should make the most of such guardians as yourself. And the second passage is your
      glowing tribute to the loyalty and friendly feeling of Pompey and Brutus. I rejoice that they have been so honourably fair
      and courteous to you; for not only are they your relatives and my very dear friends, but one of them is the chief man of
      every age and nation, and the other has long been the chief of our younger men,<note type="footnote" n="b">b During the

      instructions were, that, as I was going to be so far away, they should not ask my advice, but do what they thought best.
      Here, however, the question suggests itself to me, <note type="margin" n="3">3</note> " What then would you have done, had

     <p> only by the weight of your public speeches and your voting in the Senate (quite enough for me, considering it was you),

      object you had in making them. For though the badges of virtue have been won by many a man who has no virtue in him, such
      sincere devotion on the part of such men as yourself can be won by virtue alone. What I therefore promise myself as the
      fruit of <note type="margin" n="2">2</note> our friendship is that friendship itself, and nothing can be more richly fertile

       Lemonia after his tribe. He was born in 105, being thus a year older than Cicero, with whom in his youth he attended
       Molon's lectures on oratory in Rhodes, but afterwards devoted himself to jurisprudence. Early in the Civil War he was a
       somewhat tepid Pompeian, while his son was an ardent Caesarean. After Pharsalia he lived at Samos, where Brutus attended
       his lectures. In 46 Caesar made him Governor of Achaia. After the murder of Caesar he tried to reconcile the contending
       parties, and in 43 was sent by the Senate as an ambassador to Antony, who was then besieging Mutina, and there he died.

     <p> these calamities long before they happened, were the champion of peace both during <note type="footnote" n="a">a

      same opinion myself, I made no headway. You see I had arrived late, I was all alone, I was supposed to be ill-informed as to
      the facts, and I had suddenly found myself in the midst of a throng of men mad with the lust of battle. Now that it seems
      that we can be of no assistance at all to the Republic, if there is anything in which we may take thought for our own
      selves—not in the way of retaining anything worth retaining of our pristine position, but of investing our grief with what
      dignity we may—there is nobody in the world with whom I think I ought to confer rather than with yourself. For you never
      forget either the examples of those famous men whom we ought to resemble, or the maxims of those wise men whom you have
      always venerated. And I should have myself written to you before to warn you that it would be useless for you to attend the

     <p> You ask me what plan I have; well, it is the sort <note type="margin" n="2">2</note> of plan that I could more easily
      adopt myself than recommend to another. For what policy is there that I could venture to press upon a man of your
      exceptional influence and consummate sagacity? If we are asking what is the most right and proper course, it is there for
      all to see; if what is most expedient, well, that is not so evident. But if we are the kind of men we surely ought to be,
      the kind to believe that nought is expedient but what is right and honourable, then there can be no possible doubt as to
      what we should do. You assume a close connexion between your case <note type="margin" n="3">3</note> and mine; well, we were
      certainly both guilty of a like mistake, though our sentiments were most loyal. For whatever the policy of each of us, what
      we had in view was harmony, and as there was nothing more to the advantage of Caesar himself, we imagined that we were even
      earning his gratitude by our advocacy of peace. How greatly we have been deceived, and to what a pass things have come, you
      can see for yourself; and not only do you clearly understand all that is being done and all that has already been done, but
      also what the trend of affairs is, and what is likely to be the issue. One is therefore obliged either to approve the
      measures now being taken, or else to be implicated in them even if one does not approve. The former alternative strikes me

      certain degree my own case, still I am sorry that, endowed as you are with a wisdom almost unique, you should not rather
      delight in your own blessings than be harassed by the misfortunes of others. As regards myself, though I yield to no man as
      having suffered more sorrow than myself through the destruction and ruin of the Republic, I now find much to console me, and
      most of all the consciousness of the policy I had advocated. Long before it came, I foresaw as from some high watch-tower
      the storm that was to be, and that not by my own intuition only, but far more in consequence of your </p>

      quasi parietinis reipublicae?" Est omnino vix consolabilis dolor; tanta est omnium rerum amissio et desperatio recuperandi.
      Sed tamen et Caesar ipse ita de te iudicat, et omnes cives sic existimant, quasi lumen aliquod exstinctis ceteris clucere

     <p> warnings and denunciations. For though I was absent during a great part of your consulship, yet even in my absence I used
      to be informed of what opinions you expressed in guarding against and foretelling this pernicious war, and I was myself
      present in the early days of your consulship, when, after a survey of all our civil wars, with a wealth of detail you urged
      the Senate, while they feared the warnings of the civil wars within their memory, to draw the inference that, as the earlier
      combatants had shown a ruthlessness hitherto quite unprecedented in the Republic, so whosoever should subsequently succeed
      in crushing the Republic by force of arms would display a tyranny far more intolerable. For men assume that what is done by
      precedent is also done by right; but they add to that precedent and contribute to it something, nay rather, a great deal of
      their own. And that is why you ought to remember, that <note type="margin" n="2">2</note> those who failed to follow your
      authority and advice perished by their own folly, when your far-sightedness might have been their salvation. You will say "
      What consolation is that to me, amid this oppressive gloom, and what I may call the crumbling walls of the Republic? " Yes,
      it is undoubtedly a sorrow that hardly admits of consolation; so overwhelming is the sense of universal loss without hope of
      recovery. And yet this is Caesar's own judgement of you, and the opinion of all your fellow-citizens—that your uprightness,
      your wisdom, and your worth, shine forth like some great light, when all other lights are quenched. This ought to conduce
      much to the alleviation of your troubles. Now as to your being away from your friends, that is the more easily to be </p>

      them, were I not afraid that, far from home as you are, you might be made aware of things which you do not actually see, and
      are therefore, it seems to me, better off than we who do see them. I think the consolation I have offered you is justified,
       <note type="margin" n="3">3</note> so far as it meant your being informed by one who is most friendly to you of what might
      mitigate your distress. You have other means of consolation in your own hands, and they are neither unknown to me nor the
      least important—indeed, I feel they are by far the most important—and I have so tested their efficacy by daily trial, that
      they seem to me to represent salvation. Now I well remember that you have been from the early days of your adolescence
      deeply devoted to every form of philosophical learning, and have mastered with enthusiastic diligence all the traditions of
      the wisest philosophers on the way to live aright. These could, of course, be a profit and a pleasure to us at the best of

      distract the mind from brooding on its troubles. Your son Servius busies himself with conspicuous success in all the liberal

     <p> modest "); and yet even so (and there is no " mock-modesty " in this either) I readily acknowledge your superiority in
      the refinement and good taste <note type="footnote" n="a">a Or " purity and propriety " (Watson).</note> of your
      compositions. That policy of yours which, as you write, led you <note type="margin" n="2">2</note> not to decline this post
      in Achaia, I have always approved, and approve much more heartily now that I have read your last letter; for all the reasons
      you specify are perfectly sound and quite worthy of your high position and sagacity. You think that in this case things have
      not turned out as you expected; well, there I do not agree with you at all. The fact is that so appalling is the general
      disorganization and chaos, so irremediable the overthrow and prostration of every interest by this most horrible war, that
      every man thinks that where he happens to be is the most miserable place, and himself the most miserable person in the
      world; and that is precisely why you not only regret your policy, but also imagine that we who are at home are happy; while
      we on the other hand consider you to be, not indeed free from all annoyances, but still happy as compared with ourselves.
      Moreover, in this particular respect your lot is better than ours—you venture to put in writing what is troubling you, we
      cannot do even that with any safety; and that is through no fault of the victor, who is a marvel of moderation, but of the
      victory itself, which in civil wars is ever overbearing. On one point I claim a victory over you; I got to <note
       type="margin" n="3">3</note> know of the restoration of your colleague Marcellus, <note type="footnote" n="b">b M.
       Marcellus, consul with Sulpicius in 51 B.C., when he showed himself a bitter enemy to Caesar. He even caused a citizen
       (according to some authorities, a senator or ex-magistrate) of Comum to be scourged at Rome for some trivial offence, to
       prove that he repudiated the validity of the civitas conferred upon that colony, under the Lex Vatinia, by Caesar. Early in
       49 he urged, but unsuccessfully, the necessity of levying Republican troops before openly breaking with Caesar. He fled
       from Rome on the outbreak of the Civil War, and after Pharsalia retired to Mitylene, where he devoted himself to rhetoric
       and philosophy. In 46, his cousin C. Marcellus, in a full senate, implored Caesar to pardon his kinsman, with the result
       described in this letter. Cicero formally expressed his gratitude to Caesar in his speech Pro Marcello. Returning to Rome,
       Marcellus got as far as the Piraeus, where he was murdered by P. Magius Cilo (see Ep. xii. of this Book).</note>

     <p> a little earlier than you did; and, more than that, I declare to you that I saw how the whole business was managed.
      Please understand this—ever since these calamities set in, I mean ever since national right was first submitted to the
      arbitrament of arms, this is the only dignified transaction that has occurred. For Caesar himself, having protested against
      Marcellus's " acrimony " (that is the term he used) and having eulogized in the most complimentary terms both your fairness
      and your far-sightedness, suddenly and unexpectedly declared that he would not refuse the request of the Senate in the
      matter of Marcellus, in spite of its being a bad omen. <note type="footnote" n="a">a That is, for the future relations
       between Caesar and the Senate. The earlier reading hominis would mean " even though the particular person in question
       happened to be Marcellus "; but this is less consistent with VI. 16. 10 " Marcellum . . . cum summa illius dignitate
       restituit."</note> Now when the question of Marcellus had been opened by L. Piso, <note type="footnote" n="b">b L.
       Calpurnius Piso, Caesar's father-in-law, consul with Gabinius in 58.</note> and when Gaius Marcellus <note type="footnote"
       n="c">c Cousin of Marcus Marcellus; he was consul in 50.</note> had flung himself at Caesar's feet, the Senate, as it had
      previously arranged to do, rose in a body and approached Caesar with an air of supplication. Not to waste words, this seemed
      to me so glorious a day that I imagined I saw before me some fair vision of the Republic rising, as it were, from the dead.
      And so when all who had <note type="margin" n="4">4</note>been asked to speak before me had expressed their gratitude to
      Caesar (except Volcatius, who declared, that had he been in Caesar's place, he would not have acted as Caesar did <note
       type="footnote" n="d">d Others take it to mean " had he been in Marcellus's place, he would not have accepted
       pardon."</note>), on being asked my opinion I broke my resolution; for I had determined, not, I assure you, from indolence,
      but because I resented the loss of my former position, never to speak again. This determination of mine suddenly gave way
      before Caesar's magnanimity and the Senate's devotion <note type="footnote" n="e">e To Marcellus, as one of its
       members.</note>; and so I expressed my thanks to Caesar at considerable length; and I am afraid that in all other such
      cases I have cheated myself of the honourable leisure which was my one solace amid my troubles. </p>

     <p> But anyhow, seeing that I have now avoided giving offence to one who, had I remained persistently silent, might have
      thought that I do not regard this as a constitutional government at all, I shall act in that respect with moderation, or
      even keep on the safe side of moderation, so as to serve his will without sacrificing my own inclinations. For though every
      department of liberal erudition, and philosophy most of all, has been my delight from my earliest manhood, yet this
      prepossession of mine grows upon me day by day, partly, I suppose, because my age is ripening for the reception of wisdom,
      partly because the times are evil, so that there is nothing else that can ease my mind of its annoyances. You, as I gather
      from your letter, are drawn away <note type="margin" n="5">5</note> from such studies by press of business; but still at
      this season of the year, the nights will help you considerably. Your, or rather our dear boy Servius, shows me the greatest
      deference and respect, and I am delighted as well with his general integrity and excellent character as with his studies and
      acquirements. He has many a talk with me about your staying on or quitting the province. So far my opinion holds, that we
      should do nothing but what we think Caesar most desires. Such is the situation here, that supposing you were at Rome, you
      could find no pleasure in anything except in your own people. As for the rest, nothing could be better than the great man
      himself; everybody and everything else is such that—well, if you had to make the choice, you would much rather hear about
      them than see them. It is no pleasure to me to give you this advice, as I am longing to see you; but I am thinking of what
      is best for you. Farewell. </p>

     <p> V SERVIUS SULPICIUS RUFUS TO M. T. CICERO Athens, middle of March, 45 B.C. The announcement of the death of your daughter
      1 Tullia,<note type="footnote" n="a">a Tullia seems to have died early in 45 B.C., after the birth of a son. Dolabella had
       divorced her probably a short time before (Watson).</note> which I duly received, was, believe me, as it was bound to be, a
      painful and bitter blow to me, and I regarded it as a calamity to both of us alike. Had I been there, I should not have
      failed you, and should have convinced you in person of my sympathy. Of course, any consolation of this kind is depressing,
      and even unpleasantly embarrassing, because the relatives and intimate friends, upon whom lies the duty of tendering it, are
      themselves bearing a like burden of sorrow, and cannot attempt the task without the shedding of many a tear, so that one
      would imagine that they themselves need others to console them, rather than that they can possibly discharge what is their
      own duty to others. But even so I have decided to set down in a short letter to you the thoughts that have occurred to me on
      the present occasion, not that I imagine they escape you, but because perhaps you are so blinded by grief, that you have a
      less clear perception of them. What reason is there for your being so profoundly <note type="margin" n="2">2</note>
      distressed by a private sorrow affecting yourself? Consider how fortune has dealt with us hitherto, that we have been robbed

      preferments of the state. How could this one new loss have added anything to your grief? Or what man's mind trained in such

      bad physicians who, in treating the diseases of others, profess to have mastered the whole art of healing, but themselves
      they cannot cure; nay, rather apply to yourself and set before your own mind the precepts you so often seek to impress upon
      others. There is no grief that is not diminished and mitigated <note type="margin" n="6">6</note> by the lapse of years. To
      await that lapse, instead of hastening to forestall the effect by applying your wisdom, is not creditable to you. But if
      there be any consciousness even among the dead, such was your daughter's love for yourself and affection for all her family,
      that this at any rate is not what she would have you do. Offer this as a tribute to her who has passed away; to your friends
      and comrades, for your sorrow is their own: to your country, so that if there be any need for ft, she may have the benefit
      of your assistance and advice. One last word—since fate has brought us to such a pass that we are compelled to give
      consideration even to such a matter—do not make the mistake of giving anybody grounds for suspecting that it is not so much
      your daughter's death that is the cause of your mourning, as the critical state of public affairs and the triumph of our
      opponents. I am ashamed to write at greater length to you on this subject, lest I seem to have lost confidence in your good
      sense. Therefore, when I have put forward this one point, I will bring my letter to a close. We have observed on several
      occasions that you bear good fortune with admirable self-control, and thereby gain much credit; make a point of convincing

      Astura, middle of April, 45 B.C. Yes, Servius, I could, indeed, have wished, as you <note type="margin" n="1">1</note> say,
      that you had been by my side in my most grievous affliction. How much you could have helped me had you been with me, by
      comforting me and bearing an almost equal share of my grief, I can easily understand from the feeling of greater
      tranquillity which your letter gave me. For not only did you write what could assuage my grief, but in consoling me you
      showed no small sorrow of your own. Your son Servius, however, by doing me all the kindnesses that such an occasion could
      demand, made it plain how highly he esteemed me himself, and also how grateful he was sure you would be for such a proof of
      his affection for me; and though I have often felt greater pleasure in his good services, I have never been more grateful
      for them. Now as regards myself, not only do I find comfort in your discourse, and in what I may call your partnership in my
      sickness of soul, but also in the influence of your personality; for I consider it dishonourable in me not to bear my

      their private grief was mitigated by the high positions they were winning for themselves in the service of the state. But in
      my <note type="margin" n="2">2</note> case, after the loss of all those distinctions which you specify, and which I had
      gained by the most strenuous exertions, there still remained that one solace which has now been torn from me. I had no
      friends' interests, no public responsibility to interrupt my broodings; it was no pleasure to me to do anything in the
      courts; as for the senate-house, I could not bear the sight of it; I began to think, and it was the fact, that I had been
      robbed of the fruits of all my hard work and success. But when I reflected that I but shared these misfortunes with yourself
      and certain others, and tried to break myself in, and force myself to bear it all with patience, I always had a sanctuary to
      flee to and a haven of rest; I had one whose sweet converse could help me to drop the burden of all my anxieties and
      sorrows. But as it is, so cruel is this new wound, that the old wounds, too, which I thought had entirely healed, are

      have prompted me to write and tell you what I thought conducive to your personal welfare, and considered not incompatible
      with your dignity. That you were the man who anticipated with remarkable <note type="margin" n="2">2</note> foresight the
      beginnings of these calamities, who administered the consulship with such magnificence and efficiency—of that I have a very
      vivid recollection; but at the same time I observed this too, that you disapproved of the plan of campaign in the civil war,
      and of Ponipey's troops and the composition of his army, and that you always utterly distrusted it; and I think it is within
      your recollection that I, too, held that opinion. <note type="footnote" n="a">a See Chron. Sum. 48 B.C.</note> You,
      therefore, took no great part in the campaign, and I always made a point of taking no part at all. For we were not fighting
      with the weapons which might have given us strength, such as judgment, the weight of personality, or the soundness of our
      cause, in all of which we were superior, but with the brute force of our muscles, in which we were no match for our
      adversaries. We were consequently defeated, or, if worth knows no defeat, we were at any rate crushed and humiliated. And

      hostilities (and these are they who betook themselves to Africa), or else, just as I did myself, they threw themselves on
      the mercy of the conqueror; your policy was a kind of compromise, because you perhaps thought that the latter course showed
      a cringing, and the former a stubborn, spirit. I quite admit that your policy was deemed a wise one by most people, or shall

      have adopted has its limitations, especially as I am sure that the one thing you lack to retain all your possessions is the
      will to do so; for I have come to the conclusion that there is but one thing which causes our omnipotent friend to hesitate,

      embraced the whole world, would you not rather reside without danger in your own house than reside with danger in the house
      of another? For my own part, I would sooner be at home and in my own country, even if it meant my facing death, than in any
      strange and foreign land. This is what all those feel who are fond of you; and as might be expected from your very great and

      that will not be permitted either by him who rules the Republic, nor by the Republic itself; but apart from that I don't
      want to see an assault of brigands upon your estate. Who these brigands are, <note type="footnote" n="a">a Possibly, as
       Manutius thinks, the relatives of M. Marcellus (other than his cousin C. Marcellus, mentioned below). An instance of the

       were consuls in three successive years, Marcus, who writes this letter, in 51, Gaius, his first cousin, in 50, and Gaius,
       his brother, in 49. As the second Gaius, the brother of Marcus, appears to have died in 48, the C. Marcellus to whom Cicero
       here refers must almost certainly be M. Marcellus's cousin, and not his brother, frater being used elsewhere also by Cicero
       for " a first cousin."</note>; in solicitude and sorrow I come next, in entreaties I lag behind him, not having the right

      defeated man may command. But for all that, in the way of counsel and active devotion I am still loyal to Marcellus. By the

       >1</note> exceptional sagacity as yourself, nor to encourage one of such high spirit and unequalled fortitude, and as for
      offering you consolation, it is out of the question. For if you are bearing what has happened as I hear you are, I ought
      rather to felicitate you on your manliness than to console you in your grief. But if you are being crushed by the terrible
      calamities of the Republic, I have not such a superabundance of ingenuity as to comfort you when I cannot comfort myself. It
      remains then that I should so order my conduct in the present and in the future, and be so constantly on the alert to
      further all your friends' desires, as to prove my belief that I owe you in the advancement of your cause not only all that
      is within my power, but even what is beyond it also. Anyhow, please take it either as my advice to <note type="margin" n="2"
       >2</note> you, or my definite opinion, or as something which out of kindness I could not suppress, when I urge you to
      resolve, like myself, that, if there be a Republic, it is incumbent upon you—a leading man both in fame and fact—to take
      your place in it, yielding to the irresistible pressure of circumstances; but if there be no Republic, you should still
      believe that this is the most suitable place for you to live in, even as an exile. For if liberty is what we are after, what

     <p> of you to be moved by the sense of sight alone, and to be less distressed when the same fact reaches you by hearsay, when
      it often appears even worse than it is. But (you will argue) you, like the rest of us, will <note type="margin" n="2"
       >2</note> have to say something you do not feel, and do something you do not approve. In the first place, it has ever been
      considered the mark of a wise man to yield to circumstances, in other words, to bow to the inevitable; in the second place,
      as matters now stand, things are not as bad as all that. Perhaps you are not at liberty to say what you think, but you are
      quite at liberty to say nothing. For all power has been put in the hands of one man, who follows no man's advice but his
      own, not even that of his own friends. And it would have been much the same, if he <note type="footnote" n="a">a The whole
       paragraph of course refers to Pompey.</note> whom we followed were in charge of the Republic. Can we possibly suppose that
      the man who in time of war, when we were all united by a common danger, took counsel of himself alone and a notorious clique
      of exceedingly indiscreet advisers, would have been likely to be less self-centred <note type="footnote" n="b">b Or " more
       accessible."</note> in the hour of his triumph than he had been when the issue was in the balance? And can you suppose that
      he who neither followed your excellently wise advice when you were consul, nor when your cousin discharged the functions of
      consul with your support, was inclined to avail himself of the counsel of either of you, would now, if he held everything in
      his hands, have been likely to desire the expression of our opinions? All is misery in civil wars; our ancestors never <note

      facienda sunt. An tu non videbas mecum simul, quam illa crudelis esset futura victoria? Igitur tunc quoque patria careres,
      ne, quae nolles, videres? Non, inquies; ego enim ipse tenerem opes et dignitatem meam. At erat tuae virtutis in minimis tuas

     <p> miserable than victory itself; for though it falls to the better men, it nevertheless makes those very men more arrogant
      and less self-controlled, so that even if they are not so by nature, they are compelled to be so by necessity. For there are
      many things a victor is obliged to do even against his will at the caprice of those who helped him to victory. You must have
      seen, at the time I saw it, how ruthless this victory was destined to prove; would you then at that time also have made an
      exile of yourself to prevent your seeing what was objectionable to you? " No," you will say, "for I should still have been
      in possession of my wealth and position." Yes, but it behoved one of your high principles to regard your own private
      interests as comparatively of very little importance, and to be more deeply distressed at the state of the Republic. Again,
      what is to be the final issue of this policy of yours? For so far your conduct is approved, and your good fortune, too,
      considering the circumstances, is extolled — your conduct, in that, compelled as you were to follow the call of the war in
      its initial stage, you wisely declined to follow it up to the bitter end; your good fortune, in that you have maintained in
      an honourable retirement both the dignity and the reputation of your exalted rank. Now, however, there is no place in the
      world that should hold a greater charm for you than your country; and you ought not to love her any the less, but rather
      pity her, because of her disfigurement, and not to deprive her, bereft as she is of so many distinguished sons, of the light
      of your countenance as well. Finally, if it was the mark of a high spirit not to <note type="margin" n="4">4</note> have

      you are unable to enjoy a public life, it is surely senseless to refuse to enjoy a private one. The main point is this, that
      if you think your present life is more comfortable, you still have to consider whether it is not less safe. There is no
      limit to the licence of the sword, but in foreign countries there is even less scruple in committing a crime. For myself, so
      anxious am I about your safety that I am on a par with your cousin Marcellus, or at any rate I come next to him. For you it
      remains to make the best of your opportunities and to take thought for your rights as a citizen, your life, and your

      I felt it impossible to give him nothing in the way of a letter. Take care then to come as soon as possible; for believe me,
      your coming will end a period of eager expectancy, not only among us, by which I mean your friends, but among all without

      I summoned them, and immediately started for the place in the early dawn. I was not far from the Piraeus, when I was met by

      that they were prevented from doing so by their religious regulations; anyhow, we must admit that it was a concession they
      had never yet made to anybody. They did allow us to do what was the next best thing, to inter him in the precincts of any

      times of ours in its gloom and melancholy; but I cannot fall back even upon that. For even that should surely convey either
      the promise of some substantial help or some consolation for your grief. I have no promise to make; for humiliated as I am
      by a misfortune like your own, it is only by extraneous assistance that I bear the weight of my afflictions, and my heart is
      more often inclined to deplore the conditions, than to rejoice in the fact, of my being alive. Although I have not myself
      personally been the <note type="margin" n="2">2</note> victim of any particularly glaring act of injustice, and though it
      has never occurred to me even under present conditions to desire anything which Caesar has not spontaneously bestowed upon
      me, still none the less, so crushing are my anxieties, that I do not think I am acting aright even in remaining alive at
      all. For I have lost not only numbers of my most intimate friends, either torn away from me by death, or dragged from my
      side by banishment, but also all those friends whose affection I had won by the part I once played, in conjunction with
       yourself,<note type="footnote" n="a">a This refers to Figulus's support of Cicero in the Catilinarian conspiracy.</note> in
      the successful defence of the Republic; and all around me I see the shipwrecks of their fortunes and the pillaging of their
      possessions; and not only do I hear of it, which would in itself be a misery to me, but I actually see, and it is the most
      distressing sight in the world, the squandering of the property of those men with whose assistance we once extinguished that
      awful conflagration; and in the very city in which but lately I was richly blessed in popularity, influence, and fame, of
      all that there is now nothing left me. </p>

     <p> I do continue to enjoy Caesar's extreme courtesy to me; but that cannot counterbalance violence and revolution in every
      relation of life and in the times themselves. And so, bereft of all to which I had become <note type="margin" n="3">3</note>
      habituated by my natural disposition, inclinations, and daily life, I am not only a nuisance to others, as I am sure I am,
      but even to myself. For though it is my very nature to be ever engrossed in some important work worthy of a man, I have now
      not only no scheme of action, but not even a scheme of thought. And while hitherto I have been in a position to offer my
      assistance to obscure or even guilty men, I am now not in a position to make even a promise of kindness to Publius Nigidius,
      incomparably the most learned and most virtuous of men, at one time a universal favourite and to me assuredly the best of
      friends. So that style of letter-writing has been plucked out of my reach. It only remains for me to comfort you, and to
       <note type="margin" n="4">4</note> suggest considerations whereby I may try to distract your thoughts from your miseries.
      But that genius for comforting either yourself or another, if ever man had it, is possessed in its full perfection by
      yourself; with any such topic, therefore, as has its source in what I may term the finer pursuits of learning, I shall not
      meddle, but leave it entirely to you. What conduct is worthy of a brave and wise man, what is imperatively demanded of you
      by your dignity, your loftiness of mind, your past history, the researches and accomplishments for which you have been
      distinguished from your boyhood—all that you will see for yourself. For" my part, because I am in Rome and because I am

      you will have to endure for ever. It seems to me quite clear, in the first place, that <note type="margin" n="5">5</note>
      the very man who has most to say in the matter is decidedly disposed to sanction your restoration. I am not writing thus at
      random. The less my intimacy with him, the more searching are my investigations. It is only to make it easier for him to
      give a less favourable reply to those with whom he is more angry than with you, that he has hitherto been dilatory in
      delivering you from your distress. As a matter of fact it is surprising how well those who are in close touch with him, and
      indeed those in whose company he finds most pleasure, both speak and think of you. Add, moreover, the goodwill of the
      commons, or rather the unanimity of all classes. Even our great Republic herself whose power, it is true, is now at its
      lowest (but power she is bound to have), whatever her strength may be, will at an early date, believe me, prevail upon the
      very men, who now hold her in subjection, to grant this boon on your behalf. I therefore come back to this—I now even make
       <note type="margin" n="6">6</note> you a promise, which at first I forebore to make. It is my intention to make friends
      with those in closest touch with him, who already have a high regard for me, and are much in my company, and, moreover, to
      worm myself into familiarity with the great man himself—a familiarity from which I have been hitherto shut out by my own
      lack of self-assertion, and I shall not fail to follow up every opening </p>

      crushing was bound to be the ruin of my fellow-citizens, some of them men of the highest rank, others of the highest

      other words, how bravely you were bearing our common calamities, I had no means of learning; how sincerely you loved me, I
      could easily perceive; but the latter I knew already; had I known the former, I should have written accordingly. But despite
      the fact that I have previously written <note type="margin" n="2">2</note> as much as I considered ought to be written, I
      have yet thought it necessary at such a crisis as this to caution you briefly not to imagine that you are in any special
      danger of your own; we are all in great danger, but after all it is a common danger. It is not right then that you should
      either demand for yourself alone any special privilege of fortune, or repudiate the fortune that has befallen us all. Let
      us, therefore, continue to be on the same terms of mutual friendship as we always have been. What I can but hope for in your
      case, I can guarantee in my own. </p>

       helped to quell the Catilinarian rebellion. He was now governor of Cisalpine Gaul (not proconsul, though so called), a
       province which Cicero had renounced in his favour. He was consul with L. Afranius in 60, and died in 59, poisoned, it was
       suspected, by his wife Claudia, sister of P. Clodius. The incident here mentioned is explained in Cicero's reply to Celer

      have escaped being ridiculed and insulted in my absence, and that my brother would not have had his civil rights and his
      property attacked through you, all for a mere phrase. <note type="footnote" n="b">b By " a mere phrase " he must mean the

       Roman citizens to death without a trial." The veto of Nepos was the " mere phrase " to which Celer refers to in the
       preceding letter. Cicero's retort in the Senate forced Nepos to leave Rome, thereby vacating his tribunate, and it would

      injurious a policy. And yet, as I know for certain that you were told, <note type="margin" n="7">7</note> on the last day of
      December he inflicted upon me, consul and saviour of the Republic as I was, an indignity such as has never yet been
      inflicted upon any man holding the lowest office in the state, were he the most disloyal of citizens—he robbed me, on laying
      down my office, of the privilege of addressing the people; but that indignity after all resulted in my being most highly
      honoured. For though he permitted me to do no more than merely take the oath, I took that oath, and a very true and glorious
      oath it was, in a loud voice; and the people also swore as loudly that that same oath I had sworn was true. <note
       type="footnote" n="d">d The words of the oath were rem publicam atque hanc urbem mea unius opera esse salvam, " that the

     <p> Now though I had suffered so notable an insult, <note type="margin" n="8">8</note> nevertheless, on that very day I sent
      some common friends of ours to Metellus to entreat him to abandon his intention; but his answer to them was that he had
      already committed himself. And he had, as a matter of«fact, not long before publicly declared that a man who had punished
      others without a trial ought not himself to be granted the privilege of making a speech. What a sterling character! What a
      peerless patriot! For, in his judgment, the man who had delivered the Senate-house from massacre, the City from
      incendiarism, and Italy from war, deserved the same punishment as that inflicted by the Senate, with the unanimous approval
      of all honest men, upon those who had purposed to fire the City, butcher the magistrates and the Senate, and fan the flames
      of a devastating war. And so I defied your brother Metellus to his face. For on the 1st of January I so dealt with him in
      the Senate on the political situation, as to convince him that the man with whom he would have to fight lacked neither
      courage nor determination. On the 3rd of January, when he began to develop his proposal, <note type="footnote" n="a">a That
       Pompey should be recalled from the East to restore order in Italy.</note> every other word of his speech was a challenge or
      a threat to me, and he had no more deliberate purpose in mind, than by any means in his power, not by legal procedure or
      fair argument, but by brute force and browbeating, to effect the overthrow of myself. Had I not stood up to him, in his
      hot-headed attack upon me, with some courage and spirit, who in all the world would not suspect that the fortitude I showed
      in my consulship was due to accident rather than to policy? If you were not aware that Metellus harboured <note

      recognize my kindness —if indeed " kindness " is the word for slackness and indifference of mind under so exasperating an
      outrage. Never once did I express an opinion in the Senate unfavourable to your brother; whenever there was any proposal
      about him, I agreed, without rising, with those whose proposals seemed to me to be the least drastic. I will add this too,
      that though I need not have troubled myself in the matter after what had occurred, still, so far from resenting the measure,
      I did my very best to help its being carried—I mean that a release from his penalties <note type="footnote" n="a">a e. g.
       his expulsion from office. Jeans translates "a proposal for granting him a bill of indemnity."</note> should be granted by
      a decree of the Senate to my assailant, all because he was your brother. This proves that I did not " attack " your brother,
       <note type="margin" n="10">10</note> but merely repelled your brother's attacks; nor have I been 'fickle-hearted " towards
      you (I quote your letter), but so constant at heart as to remain ever true to my kindly feeling for you, although I am no

      pay it the tribute of my highest commendation; for my own feeling prevents my forgetting the power of brotherly love. I only
      beg you on your side, too, to prove an impartial judge of my own resentment; and if your friends have attacked me bitterly,
      ruthlessly, and without provocation, I ask you to come to the conclusion that not only ought I to have refused to surrender,
      but that in such a cause, I ought even to have availed myself of your assistance, and that of the army you command. <note

      was that I did not like to pester you with correspondence. Now, however, my brother Quintus has sent me a <note

      because it has been interrupted by the many vicissitudes of the times. <note type="footnote" n="a">a Cicero and Crassus were
       thrice estranged and thrice reconciled. The first quarrel was due to Cicero's ascribing to Pompey the whole credit of the
       Servile War; the second was due to Crassus's activity in urging the banishment of Cicero, but a reconciliation was
       effected, mainly through Crassus's son Publius. The third arose from Crassus's support of Gabinius, and the subsequent
       reconciliation is described in i. 9. 2. The complimentary and even affectionate tone of this letter contrasts unpleasantly
       with what Cicero calls Crassus in a contemporary letter to Atticus (iv. 13. 2)—"o hominem nequam! " " what a worthless
       rascal! "</note> And it was not, I solemnly asseverate, that I ever <note type="margin" n="2">2</note> lacked the will to
      show you either respect or honour, but certain pestilent fellows, resenting the praise bestowed upon another, have once or
      twice estranged you from me, and now and then caused me to change my opinion of you. But an opportunity occurred, for which
      I had prayed rather than hoped, of enabling me in the zenith of your prosperity to give convincing proof that I was neither
      forgetful of our mutual goodwill nor disloyal to our friendship. For I have succeeded in making not only your whole family,
      but every citizen without exception, acknowledge the sincerity of my friendship for you; with the result that that paragon
      of women, your wife, as well as those admirably affectionate, gallant, and popular men, your sons, rely implicitly upon my
      counsel and advice, my zeal and my public policy; while both the Senate and the people of Rome understand that during your
      absence you have nothing so quickly available, or so ready to your hand, as the labour, attention, assiduity, and influence
      you can claim in all that touches your interests from myself. I believe the letters of your household are giving <note

      from that day you have never found me fail in my respect for you, nor I you in your consummate kindness and generosity to
      me. If there have occurred any ruptures between us, due not so much to acts as to suspicion on either side, false and
      fanciful as they have proved to be, let them be eradicated for ever from our hearts and lives. For such is your character,
      and such I desire my own to be, that faced as we are by the same political conditions, I feel sure that our union and
      friendship will redound to the credit of each of us. And for that reason you, on your part, will decide <note type="margin"

      decision with proper regard to my deserts— while I on my part explicitly promise you my active support in a special and
      unprecedented degree, whatever the nature of the service required, provided the object of it is your honour and renown. And
      in so doing, though I shall find a large field of competitors, I am sure I shall easily surpass them all in the judgment of
      the world in general, and particularly of your two sons. I am singularly attached to them both, but while I am equally
      well-disposed to Marcus, I am the more devoted to Publius, because, though indeed he has always done so from his boyhood,
      still just now he treats me with greater deference and affection than ever, just as though I were a second father. I should

     <p> all I promise you,'and pledge myself to do. I undertook the defence of your high position in your absence, and in that
      defence I mean to persevere, no longer for the sake of our friendship alone, but now also for the sake of my consistency. I
      therefore thought it enough for the present to write to you just this—that, if I saw myself that there was anything to be
      done in furtherance of your wishes or interests or advancement, I should do it on my own initiative; but if I received any
      hint from yourself or your friends, I should not fail to convince you that neither have you ever written, nor any of your
      friends suggested, anything to me that went unheeded. I should like you, therefore, to write to me on all subjects, great,
      small, or indifferent, as to a most intimate friend; and, moreover, to instruct your people so to avail themselves of my
      industry, counsel, authority, and influence in all business affairs, public or private, forensic or domestic, affecting
      yourself or your friends, your visitors or clients, that,, so far as is possible, in such labour my yearning for your
      presence may find alleviation. IX PUBLIUS VATINIUS <note type="footnote" n="a">a Vatinius had been appointed to the command
       of Illyricum in 46 or 45, and on the strength of some successful expeditions against the Dalmatians had been saluted as
       imperator by his soldiers. This is what he means by being " in office." The "danger " to which he refers was when he was
       accused, in 55 or the beginning of 54, of bribery and corruption (ambitus) by Licinius Calvus. His defence was conducted by
       Cicero, at the order of Pompey and Caesar. Cf. i. 9. 4.</note> TO HIS DEAR CICERO In camp at Narona, <note type="footnote"

     <p> in P. Vatinius, who desires the formal pleading of a case on his behalf. You will not, I take it, refuse the defence of a
      man when in office, whose defence you undertook when he was in danger. Besides, from my point of view, whom should I rather
      select and call to my aid than the man whose defence taught me the secret of success? And surely I need not fear that the
      man who turned his back upon a coalition of the most powerful men in Rome to fight for my political status will not
      overpower and crush the slanderous jealousies of a pack of contemptible marplots. So if you love me as much as ever, take up
      my case without reserve, and consider that you should accept and shoulder whatever burden of service it may be that the
      defence of my prestige involves. You know that my good fortune in some strange way finds plenty of detractors, though I
      swear I don't deserve it; but what does that matter, if, do what I will, it is somehow my fate to find it so? Should it
      happen then, by any chance, that there is anybody who wants to prejudice my claims, <note type="footnote" n="a">a To a

      setting me all sorts of hard tasks. You wrote me some rigmarole of an intercession, and a very earnest one it was, on behalf
      of Catilius. <note type="footnote" n="b">b Probably, as Shuckburgh suggests, an old Pompeian officer who bad turned

      yourself, and tell her not to think there is anything either so important, or so insignificant, as to seem to me either
      difficult, or beneath my dignity. Anything I may have to do in relation to your affairs I shall regard as a labour of love
      and an honour to myself. As to Dionysius, as you are my friend, wind up the business; whatever pledge you have given him, I

      for they have always been accounted a warlike race. XII CICERO TO LUCCEIUS <note type="footnote" n="a">a L. Lucceius was now
       writing his history of Rome from the Marsic or Social war. He had some experience of public life, having prosecuted
       Catiline in 64 for murders committed during the Sullan proscriptions, and having stood, though unsuccessfully, for the
       consulship with Caesar in 60. After that he seems to have devoted himself, as Sallust did, to history. He strongly
       supported Pompey in the Civil War, but must have been pardoned by Caesar, as we have a letter of his to Cicero (v. 14)
       dated 45 B. C. Cicero evidently took much pains with this letter, which he describes to Atticus (Att. iv. 6, ad fin.) as
       being valde bella, " an exceedingly pretty letter." Anyhow, Lucceius promised to do what Cicero wanted.</note> Antium,

      to face, I have been deterred by a sort of almost boorish bashfulness; but now that I am away from you I shall bring it all
      out with greater boldness; for a letter does not blush. I am fired by an extraordinary, but not—as I think—reprehensible
      eagerness to have my name rendered illustrious and renowned by no other pen than yours. And though </p>

     <p> you often assure me that such is your intention, you will still, I hope, pardon my being so impatient. The fact is, that
      the style of your works is such that, though I had always expected great things, you have surpassed my expectations, and
      have so fascinated me or fired my imagination as to make me desire that my achievements should be put on record at the
      earliest possible moment by none other than you yourself. And it is not only the prospect of celebrity in ages to come that
      impels me to grasp what I may call the hope of immortality, but also that desire I have mentioned to enjoy to the full while
      yet alive, whether it be the pronouncement of your weighty testimony, or the expression of your friendly feeling, or the
      charm of your genius. But even as I write these words I can quite appreciate <note type="margin" n="2">2</note> the pressure
      upon you of the heavy burden of various works you have undertaken and, indeed, already begun. But seeing that you had now
      almost completed your History of the Italian and Civil Wars —and you had also told me that you were breaking the ground for
      other enterprises—I would not do myself the disservice of failing to suggest that you should ask yourself the question,
      whether you would prefer to weave my part in it into the general context of your History, or else, as many of the Greek
      annalists have done—Callisthenes in his Phocian War, Timaeus in his War of Pyrrhus, Polybius in his Numantine War, all of
      whom respectively detached the wars I have mentioned from the continuity of their histories—you, too, in like manner, would
      disconnect a civil conspiracy from wars waged by public enemies and aliens. I can quite see that it makes but little
      difference to my reputation, but </p>

     <p> it certainly does affect somewhat my impatience of any delay, that you should not wait until you come to the proper place
      for it, but promptly grapple with the whole of that particular episode, and the then political situation. At the same time,
      if all your mind is concentrated upon one subject and upon one personality, I see even now in my mind's eye, how much
      richer, and more artistic will be the result. And yet I am quite sensible of my presumption, first, in laying such a burden
      upon you (for your other engagements may well justify your refusing me), and then in demanding actually that you should
      eulogize my achievements. What if they seem to you to be not so very deserving of eulogy? But anyhow, if a man has once
      transgressed the <note type="margin" n="3">3</note> bounds of modesty, the best he can do is to be shameless out and out. So
      I frankly ask you again and again to eulogize my actions with even more warmth than perhaps you feel, and in that respect to
      disregard the canons of history; and—to remind you of that personal partiality, of which you have written most charmingly in
      a certain prefatory essay, clearly showing that you could have been as little swayed by it as Xenophon's famous Hercules by
      Pleasure, <note type="footnote" n="a">a In the apologuc of Prodicus in Xen. Mem. ii. 1. 21. Lucceius had evidently in the
       preface to some work of his disclaimed showing any "personal partiality."</note> —if you find that such personal partiality
      enhances my merits even to exaggeration in your eyes, I ask you not to disdain it, and of your bounty to bestow on "our love
      even a little more than may be allowed by truth. And if I can induce you to undertake what I suggest, you will, I assure
      myself, find a theme worthy even of your able and flowing pen. From the beginning of the conspiracy to my return <note

      remedies for its calamities, while you reprehend what you consider blameworthy, and justify what you approve, setting forth
      your reasons in either case; and if you think you should treat the subject with exceptional freedom of speech, as has been
      your habit, you will stigmatize the disloyalty, intrigues, and treachery of which many have been guilty towards me Moreover,
      what has happened to me will supply you with an infinite variety of material, abounding in a sort of pleasurable interest

      reader than the manifold changes of circumstance, and vicissitudes of fortune, which, however undesirable I found them to be
      in my own experience, will certainly afford entertainment in the reading; for the placid recollection of a past sorrow is
      not without its charm. The rest of the world, however, who have passed <note type="margin" n="5">5</note> through no sorrow
      of their own, but are the untroubled spectators of the disasters of others, find a pleasure even in their pity. Take, for
      instance, the way the great Epaminondas <note type="footnote" n="a">a The famous Theban general and statesman. Having

     <p> regular chronological record of events in itself interests us as little as if it were a catalogue of historical
      occurrences; but the uncertain and varied fortunes, of a statesman who frequently rises to prominence give scope for
      surprise, suspense, delight, annoyance, hope, fear; should those fortunes, however, end in some striking consummation <note
       type="footnote" n="a">a Or "are crowned with a glorious death." Shuckburgh.</note> the result is a complete satisfaction of
      mind which is the most perfect pleasure a reader can enjoy. It will, therefore, more closely coincide with my <note
       type="margin" n="6">6</note> wishes if you prove to have adopted the plan of detaching from the main trend of your
      narrative, in which you embrace the uninterrupted history of events, this drama, if I may so call it, of my own particular
      actions and experiences; for it contains a variety of acts and a number of scenes in the way of political measures and
      situations. And I am not afraid of your thinking that I am laying a trap for your favour by a paltry piece of flattery, when
      I declare to you outright that I had rather be complimented and extolled by you than by anybody else. For neither are you
      the kind of man to be blind to your own merits, and not to suspect those who fail to admire you of jealousy, rather than
      those who praise you of sycophancy; nor am I, on the other hand, so irrational as to desire the vindication of my claims to
      everlasting renown to be undertaken by a man who does not, in the very act of vindicating those claims, himself win that
      renown which is the due meed of genius. When the great Alexander himself was anxious <note type="margin" n="7">7</note> to
      have his portrait painted by Apelles and his statue made by Lysippus in preference to all others, it was not as a mark of
      favour to them, but because </p>

      to be talked about than those who have taken particular pains to be so represented; for a single monograph of Xenophon in
      praise of that king has had a far greater vogue than any painting or statue of them all. Again, it will more effectually
      conduce both to my happiness of mind and the dignity of my memory to have won a place in your history than in that of
      others, for this reason, that not only shall I have enjoyed the advantage of your literary talent, as Timoleon enjoyed that

      established reputation, one, moreover, recognized and approved as a leader of men in the greatest and gravest issues of
      public life; so that it will appear that I have had vouchsafed me not only the celebrity which Alexander, when he visited
      Sigaeum, declared that Homer had bestowed upon Achilles, but also the weighty testimony of a great and distinguished man. I

     <p> perhaps be forced to do what some have frequently found fault with—write about myself; and yet I should be following the
      example of many distinguished men. But, as you are well aware, this kind of composition has a double drawback—the author is
      obliged to write about himself with a certain reserve, when there is anything to be praised, and to pass over what is
      deserving of censure. Besides which, it is less convincing, less impressive, and there are many in short who take exception
      to it, and say that the heralds at the public games show more modesty; for when they have crowned all the other victors and
      announced their names in a loud voice, and are then themselves presented with a crown before the dispersal of the games,
      they engage the services of some other herald, so as not to proclaim themselves victors with their own voices. This is just
      what I desire to avoid, and if you accept <note type="margin" n="9">9</note> my brief, I shall avoid it; and I entreat you

     <p> together some notes on all that occurred; but if you put me off till a later date, I shall talk it over with you in
      person. Meanwhile I am sure you will not be idle, and will complete the polishing of the works you have in hand, and remain
      my dear friend. XIII CICERO TO LUCCEIUS Astura, March, 45 B.C. Though the consolation your letter affords me is <note
       n="marg">1</note> very acceptable to me in itself—for the genuine friendliness it evinces is matched by the sound sense
      with which it is combined—still quite the greatest profit I derived from that letter was the inference I drew from it, that
      you had a magnificent contempt for the vicissitudes of human affairs and were admirably prepared and equipped to bear the
      blows of fortune; and indeed, in my judgment, the highest achievement of philosophy is this—to be independent of the outside
      world, and not to make your interpretation of life, as happy or unhappy, dependent upon external circumstances. Now though
      this belief had not wholly fallen away <note type="margin" n="2">2</note> from me (for it had taken deep root), yet it had
      been seriously shaken and shattered by the violence of tempests and the concentrated assault of misfortunes; but now I see
      that you are coming to its rescue, and feel that you have actually done so by your last letter, and with much success; and
      so I think I should tell you repeatedly, and not only </p>

     <p> etiam declarandum arbitror, nihil mihi esse potuisse <note type="margin" n="3">3</note> tuis litteris gratius. Ad
      consolandum autem cum illa valent, quae eleganter copioseque collegisti, tum nihil plus, quam quod firmitudinem
      gravitatemque animi tui perspexi; quam non imitari turpissimum existimo. Itaque hoc etiam fortiorem me puto, quam teipsum,
      praeceptorem fortitudinis, quod tu mihi videre spem nonnullam habere, haec aliquando futura meliora. Casus enim gladiatorii
      similitudinesque eae, tum rationes in ea disputatione a te collectae, vetabant me reipublicae penitus diffidere. Itaque
      alterum minus mirum, fortiorem te esse, cum aliquid speres, alterum mirum, spe ulla teneri. Quid est enim non ita affectum,
      ut id non deletum exstinctumque esse fatcare? Circumspice omnia membra reipublicae quae notissima sunt tibi; nullum reperies
      profecto, quod non fractum debilitatumve sit. Quae per-sequerer, si aut melius ea viderem, quam tu vides, aut commemorare
      possem sine dolore; quamquam tuis monitis praeceptisque omnis est abiciendus dolor. <note type="margin" n="4">4</note> Ergo

     <p> hint, but make it quite plain to you, that nothing could have given me greater pleasure than your letter. But while the
      arguments you have assembled with <note type="margin" n="3">3</note> such good taste and wealth of erudition are cogent aids
      to consolation, nothing is so cogent as my clear realization of the firmness and imperturbability of your spirit, and not to
      imitate it would, I feel, be most discreditable to me. I therefore claim to have more courage than even you yourself, who
      are my instructor in courage, in so far as you seem to me to have a definite hope that the present situation will some day
      improve. For obviously your " gladiators' risks and hazards" <note type="footnote" n="a">a Apparently Lucceius had suggested
       that you never could tell who would win.</note> and those " analogous instances " of yours, besides the arguments strung
      together in your dissertation, were calculated to forbid my utterly despairing of the Republic. It is not, therefore, from
      one point of view, so surprising that you should have more courage than I, seeing that you have some hope to go upon, but
      from another, it is indeed surprising that you should entertain any hope at all. For what is there that has not been so
      grievously damaged, but that you might as well admit that it has been destroyed and annihilated? Look around at all the
      limbs of the state which are best known to you; not one will you find, I am sure, that has not been broken or incapacitated;
      and I should pursue the subject, if I either saw things more clearly than I know you do, or could talk about them without
      sorrow; and yet, according to your admonitions and instructions, all sorrow must be thrown to the winds. My domestic
      troubles therefore I shall bear as you <note type="margin" n="4">4</note> think it right I should, and the public troubles

     <p> a little more courage perhaps than even yourself, who are my instructor. For you (so you write) have some degree of hope
      to comfort you, whereas I shall maintain my courage even amid utter despair, as, in spite of that despair, you yourself are
      at once exhorting and instructing me to do. For you cheer me with reminders of what I cannot but feel that I have done, and
      of what I achieved, with you in the first rank of my supporters. Yes, I did for my country certainly no less than I was
      bound to do— assuredly more than has ever been demanded of the heart or head of any human being. L You will, I hope, forgive

      mean to withdraw myself as much as possible from all that troubles and distresses me, and to turn my thoughts to the things
      which add a lustre to prosperity, while they help one to bear adversity. So far as our age and health on either side permit,
      I shall be your companion, and if we cannot be as much together as we could wish, we shall still so enjoy our affinity of

     <p> see you. I was surprised at your never having been in Rome after I had left, and I am still surprised at it. I am not
      sure what it is in particular that keeps drawing you away from Rome. If solitude is what attracts you, because you are
      writing or busy with some work of the kind you are generally engaged upon, I am glad, and find no fault with your
      arrangement; for nothing can be more refreshing than such solitude, not only in these cheerless and lugubrious times, but
      even in times of tranquillity, the times we pray for, especially to a mind like yours, whether we regard it as being tired
      out and therefore now in need of repose after its arduous engagements, or as a mine of erudition and therefore always
      producing something out of its store to give pleasure to others and reflect glory upon yourself. If, however, as you
      suggest, you have abandoned <note type="margin" n="2">2</note> yourself to tears and dejection, I grieve, of course, because
      you grieve and are so distressed; but if you allow me to say quite frankly what I feel, I cannot but blame you. Come now!

     <p> intimacy, the same tastes—what bond is lacking, I ask you, to make our union complete? Can we not then be together? For
      the life of me I cannot see what is to prevent it. But as a matter of fact we have not been so, though we were neighbours in
      the country at Tusculum and Puteoli; I need not say in Rome, where the forum is a meeting-place for all, so that propinquity
      of residence is of no account. But by some evil chance or other our age is confronted <note type="margin" n="3">3</note>
      with conditions which, at the very moment when I ought to have been more than ever prosperous, make me actually ashamed of
      being alive. What possible sanctuary is left to me, despoiled as I am of all that might have graced and comforted both my
      private and public life? Literary work, I presume; and indeed it is that which I find an unfailing resource; for what else
      is there for me to do? But even literature itself seems somehow or other to shut me out of any haven of refuge, and to cast
      it in my teeth that I cleave to a life which promises nothing but the prolongation of a period of utter misery. Such being
      the situation, can you wonder at my <note type="margin" n="4">4</note> absenting myself from a city where I can find no
      pleasure in my home, and where I utterly loathe the life one leads, the men one meets, the bar and the senate-house?
      Accordingly I resort to literary work on which I spend all my time—not to get out of it a lasting cure, but some little
      forgetfulness of my sorrow. But had you and I done what, owing to our daily <note type="margin" n="5">5</note> apprehension,
      it never so much as occurred to us to do, we should have been together all the time, and I should have found your ill-health

      then at an early date. XVI CICERO TO TITIUS <note type="footnote" n="a">a It is uncertain what Titius this was; most
       probably the T. Titius to whom Ep. lxxv. in Book XIII. is addressed. He had been Pompey's legatus and entertained Cicero at
       Anagnia in 56.</note> Rome (?), 46 B. C. (?). Although there is nobody in the world less fitted <note type="margin" n="1"
       >1</note> to offer you consolation, since your tribulations have caused me such sorrow that I am myself in need of
      consolation, still, seeing that my own sorrow was further removed from the bitterness of most intense grief than was yours,
      I decided that it was due to our close connexion and my friendly feeling for you that I should not remain so long silent
      while you are in such affliction, but should offer you some such measure of consolation as might mitigate, if it could not
      succeed in remedying, your sorrow. Now there is a form of consolation, extremely <note type="margin" n="2">2</note>
      commonplace I grant you, which we ought always to have on our lips and in our hearts—to remember that we are human beings,
      born under a law which renders our life a target for all the slings and arrows of fortune, and that it is not for us to
      refuse to live under the conditions of our birth, nor to resent so impatiently the misfortunes we can by no process of
      forethought avoid, but, by recalling to mind what has befallen others, to induce the reflection that what has happened to
      ourselves is nothing new. But neither these nor any other forms of consolation <note type="margin" n="3">3</note> employed

      rerum cogitatione maeres, non facile exhauriri tibi istum dolorem posse universum puto. Sin illa te res cruciat, quae magis

     <p> in literature to posterity ought, it seems to me, to carry such conviction as the present plight of the state itself and
      this prolongation of the days of ruin —days when those are happiest who have reared no children, while those who have lost
      them in these times are less to be pitied than if they had done so when there was a sound, or indeed any, Republic. But if
      what vexes you is your own private sense of <note type="margin" n="4">4</note> loss, and your mourning is merely caused by
      the contemplation of what affects yourself, I doubt if your mind can easily be purged of so personal a sorrow altogether;
      whereas if your anguish is due (as is more consistent with your affectionate nature) to your bewailing the miserable fate of
      those who have fallen, well, in that case—not to mention what I have so frequently read and heard, that there is no evil in
      death, and if there be any sensation left after death, it should be rather regarded as deathlessness than death, while, if
      all sensation be lost, what is not felt cannot properly be deemed misery at all— this I can yet confidently affirm, that
      such is the chaos, the plotting, and the danger overhanging the state, that the man who has left it all behind him cannot
      possibly, in my opinion, have misjudged the situation. <note type="footnote" n="a">a " Be a loser by the exchange." Melmoth.

     <p> idea that any evil, as you suppose, can have befallen those you loved, it means a very material abatement of your grief.
      For then there will only be left you that exclusive feeling of personal sorrow, in which they can have no share, but which
      begins and ends with yourself alone. But surely, in regard to that, it no longer becomes the moral dignity and wisdom you
      have exhibited from your boyhood, to be inordinately impatient of the troubles that have befallen yourself, when they have
      no connexion whatever with any misery or evil that may have befallen those to whom you were so devoted. The fact is that you
      have ever proved yourself, both in private and in public life, to be such that you are bound to maintain your high
      character, and obey the dictates of consistency. For whatever alleviation the lapse of time of itself is bound to bring us,
      obliterating in its course the most deep-seated of sorrows, that, I say, it is our duty by wisdom and foresight to
      forestall. And again, if there never was a woman, when <note type="margin" n="6">6</note> bereft of her children, so feeble
      in character as not, sooner or later, to make an end of her mourning, surely we men ought to anticipate by our wisdom what
      the passage of days is sure to bring us, and not to wait for time to apply the remedy which reason enables us to apply at
      this very moment. If this letter of mine has done you any good, I feel that I have achieved something that I had at heart;
      but if by any chance it has not the desired effect, I still feel that I have played the part of a very sincere well-wisher
      and friend; and that is what I should like you to believe I have always been to you, and to rest assured that I shall
      continue to be. </p>

        debt, favoured for a time the designs of Catiline, but suddenly, through the agency of P. Sulla, sold his landed property,
        paid his debts, and went to Spain, but not, as was suspected, with a view to helping Catiline. From Spain he went to
        Mauretania, and returning to Rome after the suppression of the conspiracy, he was threatened with a prosecution for being
        implicated in it. He returned to Mauretania, where he " played the part of king-maker for eighteen years." In the African
        War of 46 he greatly assisted Caesar, who gave him a kingdom in Numidia, where after Caesar's death, he was treacherously

     <p> It is not because I have forgotten our friendship <note type="margin" n="1">1</note> or wilfully broken off my customary

      period was sunk in the common ruin of the state and myself, while during the later part of it I found a difficulty in
      writing to you on account of your own most unmerited and distressing troubles. Now, however, after a sufficiently long
      interval and a more searching consideration of your admirable character and high courage, I have thought it no deviation
      from the course I have set myself to send you these words. Well, my dear P. Sittius, how have I treated you? <note
       type="margin" n="2">2</note> In those earliest days when you were being illnaturedly attacked in your absence, and even had

     <p> matters then stood, the unpopularity roused by the price of corn, the hostility not only of your own, but also of your
      friends' enemies, the unfairness of the whole trial, and many other defects in the constitution, had proved stronger than
      the merits of the case and truth itself, I never failed to put my services, advice, efforts, influence, and testimony at the
      disposal of your son Publius. And for that reason having scrupulously and <note type="margin" n="3">3</note> religiously
      satisfied all the claims of friendship, I did not think it right to omit the further duty of exhorting and entreating you to
      remember, that, though a mortal, you are yet a man; in other words, to bear philosophically our common lot of fickle change
      and chance, which no single one of us can either avoid or vouch for, to defy sorrow and misfortune with a stout heart; and
      to reflect that in our state, as in all others that have risen to empire, the like calamities have befallen the bravest and
      best of men through the injustice of tribunals. Would it were not the truth when I write that the state from which you are
      cut off is one in which no man of discernment could find any reason for gratification. Now as to your son, I am afraid that,
      if I say <note type="margin" n="4">4</note> nothing about him in my letter, it will appear as though I had omitted to
      testify to his merits as much as he deserves; but if, on the other hand, I write down all I feel, I fear that I shall so
      cause a recrudescence of your regret and sorrow. But anyhow the most sensible thing you can do is to look upon his filial
      affection, his sterling character, and his assiduity as your own assets, ready to your hand wherever you happen to be; for
      what we make our own in imagination is not less ours than what we see with our eyes. </p>

      me that you had looked forward to my arrival with the eagerness of a friend, and that, though things had not turned out as
      you had anticipated, you were greatly delighted with the policy I had adopted, but I have also derived no little pleasure
      from the expression, in this last letter of yours, of your judgment, as well as of your kindness; your judgment, because I
      understand that, as all good and gallant men ought to do, you deem nothing to be expedient but what is right and honourable;
      your kindness, because you promise that, whatever policy I shall have adopted, you will be at my side, and nothing can be at
      once more agreeable to me and in my opinion more honourable to yourself than that. My plans have been laid long ago, but I

      you to accept my own calculations as conclusive, but I gave you as free a hand as I shall never regret having given you. I

      this was a compliment, I could have paid you no greater; if a mark of confidence, I showed you almost more than I showed

      events I only acted in accordance with the law directing that we should deposit the accounts made up and balanced in two
      states, Laodicea and Apamea, which appeared to me, since this had to be done in the two chief states, to be the most
      important ones; and so, to take this particular objection first, my reply to it is, that, though I was in a hurry for just

      upon the accounts left behind in the province as accounts already rendered to the Treasury. And that is why . . . <note

      Volusius <note type="footnote" n="b">b The position, to put it shortly, seems to have been this. Volusius had entered into a
       contract on behalf of the state, which one Valerius, a banker, had taken over. Valerius had to give sureties for his
       fulfilment of the contract, among whom were Cieero's praefectus fabrum, Q. Lepta, and also one of his legati. When the
       money was called in by the state, Valerius was unable to pay more than a portion of it, and wished to transfer the
       obligation to his principal, Volusius. The lawyers, Camillus in particular, decided that the transference was illegal, and
       that, Valerius being insolvent, his sureties would have to make good the deficit. Cicero, considering that the state had
       lost nothing by the transference, and wishing to protect his personal friends, among the sureties, in his official accounts
       as proconsul entered the balance due from Valerius as a " bad debt " or "a remission," in fact " wrote it off."</note> has
      nothing to <note type="margin" n="3">3</note> do with the accounts. I am advised by skilled lawyers, and among them G.
      Camillus, the most skilled of them all, and, moreover, a very good friend of mine, that the debt could not have been
      transferred from Valerius to Volusius, but that the sureties of Valerius were liable (by the bye, it was not 3000 sestertia
      as you say, but 1900) For the money was put in our charge in the name of Valerius as the Actual purchaser <note

      of my legate and my prefect [Q. Lepta] from a very grave disaster (and that, too, although they should not have been made
      liable at all) to the good services of my secretary rather than to mine—of my assiduity, in that you believe that I had
      neither any knowledge of my duty, nor had given any thought to it, important as it was, or even to my personal danger,
      serious as it was; that it was my secretary who inserted whatever he pleased in the accounts without having so much as read
      it over to me—of my intelligence, in that you imagine I had never even thought about a matter which I had actually thought
      out with no little penetration; for not only was it my own idea to set Volusius free, but it was also I who invented the
      scheme for saving Valerius's sureties and T. Marius himself from being so heavily mulcted—a scheme not only universally
      approved, but universally applauded; indeed, if you want to know the truth, my secretary was the only man, so far as I
      gathered, who was not particularly pleased about it. But I thought it a point of honour, as long as the <note type="margin"
       n="5">5</note> people kept what belonged to it, to look after the interests of so many—well, you may call them either
      friends or fellow-citizens. Now as to Lucceius, it was arranged at the instance of Pompey, that that money should be lodged
      in a temple; <note type="footnote" n="a">a Two sums of money were thus " lodged in safety " as disputed money, where it lay
       fallow, paying no interest; the first sum, the subject of dispute between Lucceius and the state, was so lodged by Cicero
       for Pompey, the second by Rufus for P. Sestius, who was on state duty in Asia, and keeping an eye on the pecuniary
       interests of the optimates. "This latter sum Sestius took for his own expenses, and the former sum he took over in trust
       for Pompey. Rufus, however, in handing over the money to Sestius, acted under Cicero's orders, as Cicero readily
       acknowledges; but he did not enter in his accounts the fact that he had given those orders to Rufus, considering it
       unnecessary to do so as the matter was so well authenticated. This passage, especially § 9, is very interesting as showing
       that Pompey and the other optimates had already been making preparations in the East for the conflict with Caesar."

      affect you at all. I should, indeed, have been angry with myself for never having thought of adding an entry, to the effect
      that it was by my orders that you had deposited the money in the Temple, had it not been certified by the most solemn and
      incontrovertible records to whom that money was assigned, by what decree of the Senate, and by what written instructions on
      your part or on mine it was handed over to P. Sestius. For when .1 saw that the whole transaction had been so distinctly and
      minutely recorded <note type="footnote" n="a">a "Ear-marked with such a number of clues" Tyrrell.</note> as to admit of no
      misunderstanding, I did not add an entry in which you were not concerned. And yet I should prefer to have added it, now that
      I see you regret its omission. It is just as you write, "that you were bound to <note type="margin" n="6">6</note> make that
      entry"; I am of the same opinion myself; and in that there will be no discrepancy between your accounts and mine. You will,
      I am sure, add the words "by my orders"—words which I certainly did not add myself; and there is no reason why I should deny
      the omission, nor should I do so, even if there were a reason, and you objected to my denial. Again, as to the nine hundred
      sestertia, the entry was made exactly as you, or else your cousin, wished it to be made. But (since it seemed you were not
      altogether pleased in the case of Lucceius), if there is any correction I can make even at this late hour in handing in the
      accounts—well, as regards that, I have to consider, seeing that I did not avail myself of the decree of the Senate,<note

      staff—of my own staff at least. And there, indeed, I made a miscalculation; I was under the impression that the time allowed
      for sending in the names was unlimited; I was afterwards informed that it was necessary to send them in within thirty days
      of sending in my accounts. I was genuinely grieved that those rewards were not left for you to recommend in furtherance of
      your political aspirations, rather than for me, who had no such aspirations. Anyhow, as regards the centurions and staffs of
      the military tribunes no action has yet been taken; for that class of special service rewards had no time or limit attached
      to it by law. There remains the matter of the hundred <note type="margin" n="8">8</note> sestertia, <note type="footnote"

       the battle of Thapsus, and the subsequent suicide of M. Cato.</note> For it seems to me that matters there have matured
      till a decision is imminent. I think, however, it is of some importance to me (though I am not quite clear as to where
      precisely the importance lies), in any case, whatever the news from Africa may be, not to be far away from friends to advise
      me. For the position we have now reached is just this, that although there is a great difference in the claims of the
      combatants, yet I do not think there will be much difference in the results, whichever side is victorious. But undoubtedly
      my courage, weakened as it was perhaps by the uncertainty of the issue, has been wonderfully fortified by the loss of all
      hope; and it was fortified too by your earlier letter, from which I learnt how bravely you are bearing the injustice done to
      you; <note type="footnote" n="b">b Rufus, though in Italy, had probably been forbidden to enter Rome.</note> and it cheered
      me to know that the very refinement of your character, as well as your erudition, was of benefit to you. For, to tell you
      the truth, I used to think that your feelings were unduly sensitive, as is the case with almost all of us who have lived a
      gentleman's life in a free and prosperous state. But as we bore without undue elation those days <note type="margin" n="4"
       >4</note> of our prosperity, so it is our duty to bear with courage what is not only the untowardness but the total
      subversion of our fortunes at the present time; so that amid our crushing disasters we may at least gain this much good,

     <p> CICERO'S LETTERS TO HIS FRIENDS BOOK VI I CICERO TO A. TORQUATUS <note type="footnote" n="a">a Aulus Manlius Torquatus
       presided at the trial of Milo, probably as praetor, in 52 B. C. He had been a follower of Pompey, and was now in exile at
       Athens, though in 45 he seems to have been allowed to return to Italy, but not to Rome. Cicero refers to him in his De
       finibus as "vir optimus nostrique amantissimus," "the best of men and warmly attached to myself." The following letters to
       him are almost wholly of a philosophical character.</note> Rome, January, 45 B. C. Although the universal confusion of
      affairs is such <note type="margin" n="1">1</note> that every man complains of his own lot as being worse than any other,
      and there is not a man who would not rather be anywhere else in the world than where he is, still I have no doubt that the
      worst form of misery at the present time for an honest citizen is to be at Rome. For although, wherever a man is, he has the
      same feeling of exasperation at the ruin both of the public and of his private interests, still his eyes intensify his
      grief, being compelled to see what others only hear, and forbidding any distraction of his thoughts from his woes.
      Accordingly, though you cannot but be distressed by the thought of all you have lost, you must at any rate rid your mind of
      that special sorrow which I am told afflicts you most —the fact of your not being at Rome. For great as is your annoyance at
      being cut off from your family </p>

     <p> illa quidem, quae requiris, suum statum tenent, nec melius, si tu adesses, tenerent, nec sunt ullo in proprio periculo.
      Nec debes tu, eum de tuis cogitas, aut praecipuam aliquam fortunam postulare aut communem <note type="margin" n="2">2</note>
      recusare. De te autem ipso, Torquate, est tuum, sic agitare animo, ut non adhibeas in consilium cogitationum tuarum
      desperationem aut timorem. Nec enim is, qui in te adhuc iniustior, quam tua dignitas postulabat, fuit, non magna signa dedit
      animi erga te mitigati. Nec tamen is ipse, a quo salus petitur, habet explicatam aut exploratam rationem salutis suae.
      Cumque omnium bellorum exitus incerti sint, ab altera victoria tibi periculum nullum esse perspicio, quod quidem seiunctum

     <p> and possessions, the objects of your regret are as well off as ever they were—could not indeed be better off if you were
      with them—and are in no special danger. And it is not right, when you are thinking of your family, that you should either
      claim any peculiar favour of fortune, or refuse to submit to the common lot. When, however, you are thinking of yourself, my
       <note type="margin" n="2">2</note> dear Torquatus, it is incumbent upon you so to order your reflections as not to summon
      to the conclave of your thoughts either despair or fear. For neither has the man <note type="footnote" n="a">a Both here and
       in the next sentence "the man" is Caesar.</note> who has hitherto been less just to you than your deserts demanded, failed
      to give distinct indications of being more mildly disposed towards you; nor, after all, has the very man to whom you appeal
      for safety any clear and assured method of securing his own. And, though the issues of all wars are uncertain, I clearly see
      that, while victory on the one side is no source of danger to you, apart, of course, from what is involved in the general
      ruin, victory on the other <note type="footnote" n="b">b i.e., on the side of the Pompeians, who had been victorious in
       Spain.</note> is what you yourself, as I am well aware, have never been afraid of. I am left to suppose then that what
      causes you <note type="margin" n="3">3</note> the bitterest anguish is precisely what I regard in the light of a
      consolation—the common danger of the whole state; and for that overwhelming evil, however glibly philosophers may talk, I
      fear no real consolation can possibly be discovered except that of which the efficacy is in exact proportion to each man's
      moral strength and nerve. For if to have a sound judgement, and to act aright, is all that is requisite for a good and happy
      life, to speak of a man, who can hold his head up because he is eon- </p>

      rewards of victory that tempted us formerly <note type="footnote" n="a">a i.e., when we definitely joined Pompey in the
       campaign that ended with the battle of Pharsalia in 48 B. C.—the campaign mentioned below in § 5.</note> to leave behind us
      our country, our children, and all we possessed; no, I think we were following the path of a definite duty, a duty of
      justice and loyalty which we owed to the commonwealth and to our own dignity; nor again at the time we did so were we so
      fatuous as to imagine that we had victory in our hands. If therefore that has occurred, the possible happening <note
       n="marg">4</note> of which we put plainly before our eyes when we first took up the cause, we ought not to let our spirits
      sink as though something had occurred, the very possibility of which we never contemplated. Let us then be so minded as we
      are bidden to be by reason and truth, and that is to remember that we are not to be held responsible for anything in life
      other than wrong conduct; and since we are not guilty of that, to bear all the ills of humanity with calmness and
      self-restraint. And the conclusion to which these remarks point is this—that, though all be lost, virtue none the less seems
      able by herself to maintain her own ground. But if public affairs admit of any hope, then, whatever the situation turns out
      to be, you can claim a share in that hope. And yet, as I write these words, it keeps occurring <note type="margin" n="5"

      personal influence from his hesitancy and diffidence. But in those days, I assure you, it was not the soundness of our
      cause, but our policy that I impugned. I saw that we were too late in opposing arms that had long before been strength- </p>

      authority, but by the pike and by the sword. And when I stated that what did occur would happen, I was not venturing to
      foretell the future; no, it was simply that I was afraid of that happening which I saw was a possibility, and would be the
      ruin of us if it did come to pass; especially when, had I been obliged to make a forecast, one way or the other, as to the
      development and issue of the campaign, the forecast I could have made with the greater certainty was, that just that would
      happen which did come to pass. For while we excelled in those qualities which do not display themselves in battle, we were
      inferior in the practice of arms and the physical fitness of our men. But do you, I beg of you, show that courage now which
      you thought I ought to have shown then. My reason for writing thus is, that when I made <note type="margin" n="6">6</note>
      searching inquiries about you, your freedman Phylargyrus, out of the loyalty of his heart (that was certainly my
      impression), informed me that you are subject to occasional fits of profound anxiety; you ought not to be so, nor should you
      doubt that if any form of constitution survives you will occupy the position due to you, or that, if none survives, you will
      be in no more wretched plight than the rest of us. The present crisis, however, which holds us all breathless with suspense,
      you should face with all the more self-control for two reasons—you are resident in that city where the principles on which
      life should be governed had their birth and nurture, <note type="footnote" n="a">a Cf. Cie. Flacc. 62 "Athenienses, unde

      divine what the issue of a battle will be, I can yet see the issue of the war, or, if not exactly that, I can at any rate
      see, since one side or the other must necessarily prove victorious, what is likely to be the effect of victory on either

     <p> formation from your family. As to the future, however, though it is always difficult to dogmatize, still one can get
      fairly near the truth by conjecture, if the matter is such that its issue can be foreseen. In the present instance I think I
      realize no more than this, that the war will not be of long duration; though even on this very point there are some who are
      of a different opinion. For myself, as I write these words I believe something of importance has already occurred, not that
      I know it for certain, but because it is not hard to form a conjecture. For, though the Lord of War is ever impartial, <note
       type="footnote" n="a">a Cf. ξυνὸς Ενυάλιος, Hom. Il. xviii. 309.</note> and the results of battles always uncertain, on
      this occasion so great are the forces on each side, and so well equipped, it is said, for a decisive engagement, that nobody
      will be surprised whichever of the two commanders prove the victor. The general opinion, and it grows stronger every day, is
      this, that although the causes of the combatants differ very materially, there will after all not be much difference in the
      results of victory on one side or the other. Of the one party <note type="footnote" n="b">b The Pompeian party.</note> we
      have already, I think I may say, had some experience; as regards the commander c of the other, there is not a man but
      reflects how much to be dreaded is the anger of a conqueror with his sword unsheathed. At this point, if you think I am
      aggravating your <note type="margin" n="2">2</note> grief when I ought to be assuaging it, by trying to console you, I
      confess that I can discover no consolation for our common calamities except this— and this after all, if you can but take it
      to your heart, is the most convincing, and the one of which I avail myself more and more each day—I mean that the best

     <p> sciousness of a right purpose, and that there is no serious evil other than wrong conduct; and since we are so far from
      it, that our sentiments have ever been of the soundest, and it is the result of our policy rather than the policy itself
      that is the subject of censure, and since we have fully discharged our obligations, well then, let us bear what has come to
      pass with self-restraint. But, be that as it may, I do not presume to console you for the troubles common to all of us; they
      indeed require greater inventiveness in the comforter, and exceptional courage in the sufferer. But why you should have no
      special sorrow of your own, anybody could explain to you easily enough. For though a certain person has acted with less
      despatch than I had expected in relieving you, I have no doubt at all as to what that person thinks about your restoration.
      As to the others, I don't suppose that you are in any hurry to know my opinion. There remains the fact that it is painful to
      you to <note type="margin" n="3">3</note> be so long away from your family; it must be a grief to you, especially to be
      separated from those boys of yours, who are the merriest fellows in the world. But, as I wrote to you before, the times are
      such that everybody thinks he is worse off than anybody else, and where each man is, there he least wants to be. Myself, I
      consider that we who are at Rome are the most to be pitied, not only because in the case of anything that is evil, the sight
      of it is more painful than the hearing of it, but also because we are more exposed to any sudden danger that may arise than
      if we were away. Though I must say, speaking for myself who profess to comfort you, it is not so much the literature to
      which I have always devoted myself, as length of time that has brought me relief. </p>

      viri, hoc bello occiderunt, ut impudentia videatur, eamdem fortunam, si res cogat, recusare. Equidem mihi omnia propono, nec

     <p> You remember the bitterness of my grief, in <note type="margin" n="4">4</note> which my chief consolation is, that I saw
      further than anybody else, when what I desired, however unfavourable the terms, was peace. And though that is due to mere
      chance, and no prophetic inspiration of mine, I still find a pleasure in the hollow credit of having been far-seeing. In the
      second place, and this is a source of consolation common to both of us, if I were now called upon to quit the stage of life,
      the Republic from which I should have to tear myself is not one which it would pain me to forgo, especially when the change
      would deprive me of all perception. My age too makes it easier for me, and the fact that my life is now at its close, and
      not only is it gladdened by the thought of a course well run, but it forbids my fearing any violence in that change to which
      nature herself has nearly brought me. And lastly, the man, I might even say the men, who have fallen in this war were of
      such a character, that it seems an act of shamelessness not to accept the same doom should circumstances compel it. For my
      own part, there is no contingency I do not contemplate, and there is no calamity so crushing but that I believe it to be
      hanging over my head. But since there is more evil in our anticipation of it than in the very thing we dread, I am ceasing
      to fear, especially as what hangs over me not only involves no pain, but will itself be the end of pain. But what I have
      said is enough, or rather more than I need have said; it is not my garrulity, however, but my friendliness that is to blame
      for the unusual length of my letters. I was sorry that Servius <note type="footnote" n="a">a Servius Sulpicius; see Bk. iv.

       return to Italy, probably because he had libelled Caesar during the war. Caecina afterwards wrote an abject recantation,
       which he entitled his Liber Querellarum (Book of Remonstrances), of which Caesar took no notice.</note> Rome, January, 45

     <p> the subject of conjecture, I do not presume to claim a deeper insight into the future than what I am convinced is given
      you by your own vision and discernment; but for all that, since there is a possibility of your being unduly perturbed by the
      consideration of those matters, I think it my duty to express my own sentiments. The very conditions of life and the trend
      of the times are such as to make it impossible that the circumstances in which you find yourself should last for any length
      of time, either in your own case or in that of any others, or that so good a cause and such good citizens should be
      permanently affected by so intolerable an injustice. And in this connexion, in addition to the hope <note type="margin"
       n="3">3</note> with which your own personality inspires me to no ordinary degree, not only on account of your position and
      probity (for these are distinctions which others can claim as well as yourself), there are also those peculiar to yourself
      in your outstanding ability and admirable courage, and to this I positively affirm that the man who has us in his power
      attaches great importance; so that you would not have remained for a single moment in your present position were it not that
      he had considered himself insulted by that very gift of yours in which he finds a charm. But this feeling of offence is
      itself being mitigated daily, and I have hints from those who five with him that this very opinion he holds of your ability
      will weigh very heavily in your favour with the great man himself. For that reason you must in the first place keep <note

      philosophers and my extensive study, as you yourself know, of their teaching, but also from a wide experience in dealing
      with public affairs, and the many vicissitudes of my political life. And I have the more confidence in this divination <note
       type="margin" n="4">4</note> because, difficult to interpret and distracted as these times have been, it has never once in
      the slightest particular misled me. I should tell you what I had previously predicted, were I not afraid of your
      thinking,that I am making things up after they have happened. But anyhow there are a large number of people who can testify
      that though at the beginning I warned Pompey against a coalition with Caesar, I afterwards warned him not to break with him.
      I saw that the coalition meant the crushing of the Senate's power, and a rupture the stirring up of a civil war. Moreover, I
      was on the most intimate terms with Caesar, while I had the highest esteem for Pompey; but my advice, without being disloyal
      to the latter, was beneficial to both. Of other instances of my foresight I say nothing; <note type="margin" n="5">5</note>

      Susceptum bellum est quiescente me; depulsum ex Italia manente me, quoad potui. Sed valuit apud me plus pudor, meus quam
      timor. Veritus sum deesse Pompei saluti, cum ille aliquando non defuisset meae. Itaque vel officio vel fama bonorum vel
      pudore victus, ut in fabulis Amphiaraus, sic ego, prudens et sciens, ad pestem ante oculos positam sum profectus. Quo in

     <p> so well of me, should be under the impression-that I gave such advice to Pompey, that, had he followed it,Caesar, while
      he would no doubt be distinguished in civil life and a leading man in the state, <note type="footnote" n="a">a i.e., not a
       victorious commander, nor an autocrat.</note> would not have the extraordinary power he now has. I expressed the opinion
      that Pompey ought to go to Spain; and had he done so, there would have been no civil war at all. As to recognizing the
      candidature of an absentee, <note type="footnote" n="b">b Caesar in 52, being then in Gaul, requested the tribune to propose
       a law permitting him to sue for the consulship without a personal canvass. Pompey, then in his third consulship, supported
       the proposal, which was carried. See Chron. Sum. for 52 B. C.</note> I did not fight so much for making it a legal
      precedent, as for having it recognized because the people had insisted upon it at the urgent instance of the consul himself.
      There arose a pretext for war. What opportunity of either warning or remonstrating did I ever let slip, feeling as I did
      that a peace even on the most unfavourable terms was preferable to the most righteous of wars? My counsel was over-ruled,
      not <note type="margin" n="6">6</note> so much by Pompey, for he was impressed by it, but by those who relied on Pompey's
      leadership, and imagined that a victory in that war would exactly suit their private interests and their greed. The war was
      begun; I took no part in it; it was driven away from the shores of Italy, <note type="footnote" n="c">c By Pompey's
       resistance on the east of the Adriatic, and Caesar's crossing thither from Italy early in 48 B. C.</note> where I remained
      as long as I possibly could. But my sense of honour weighed more with me than my fears. I shrank from failing Pompey in his
      hour of need, considering that on a former occasion he had not failed me in mine. And so, yielding perforce to my sense of
      duty, or my fear of what good citizens would say, or the promptings of honour (call it what you please), like Amphiaraus in
      the plays, <note type="footnote" n="d">d Amphiaraus, although he foresaw the fatal termination of the expedition against
       Thebes, was persuaded to join it by his wife Eriphyle, whom Polyncices had corrupted by the gift of Harmonia's
       necklace.</note> I too, not blindly but knowingly, set forth for "the field of ruin spread before my eyes." And in this war
      no disaster has happened without my foretelling it. </p>

      political augur, have by my previous prognostications established in your eyes the credibility of my powers of augury and
      divination, my system of prediction is one in which you will be bound to believe. Well, then, the augury I give you is not
      based on the flight of a fowl of the air, nor on the omen-cry of a song-bird on the left, as in our system of augury, nor on
      the healthy eagerness <note type="footnote" n="a">a Tripudium was the technical term for the falling to the ground of the
       food given to the sacred chickens. Solistimus, lit. "most perfect." Sonivius, "rattling audibly on the pathway."</note> of
      feeding fowls, or the rattle of their food on the ground; no, I have other signs for my observation, and if not more
      infallible than those others, they are at any rate clearer and less likely to mislead. Now in noting these signs for the
      purposes of my <note n="marg">8</note> prognostications, I follow a sort of double system, the source of half of which is
      Caesar himself; of the other half, a studied survey of the present political situation. What I find in Caesar is this—a mild
      and merciful nature, such as you have so strikingly portrayed in your brilliant work, the Remonstrances. <note

     <p> "from one so angry?" Well, it is obvious to him that the very same fountain which has (only slightly I admit) bespattered
      him, will offer deep draughts of praise to his lips. Finally he is a man of penetrating intelligence who sees far ahead, and
      he knows perfectly well that a man like you—a man who is by far the. greatest nobleman in a district of Italy <note
       type="footnote" n="a">a See note c, p. 458.</note> which he can ill afford to disregard, and who, in the state to which we
      all belong, is the peer of any among the most eminent men of his age, whether in ability or popularity or reputation in the
      eyes of the Roman people—cannot be shut out from political life any longer. He will not want this favour to be attributed
      some day to the lapse of time, rather than immediately to himself. So much for Caesar. Now as to the nature of our <note
       n="marg">10</note> times and circumstances. No man is so bitter an enemy to the cause which Pompey, with more courage than
      calculation, took up as to dare to speak of us as either disloyal citizens or unprincipled men. And here I often admire the
      sobriety and justice and wisdom of Caesar; he never refers to Pompey except in the most complimentary terms. But, you will
      object, he has on many occasions treated him as a public man <note type="footnote" n="b">b "Caesar, however highly he
       regarded Cn. Pompey as a private man, had to deal with him severely as leader of the opposite party, even going so far as
       to confiscate his property." Tyrrell.</note> with undue harshness. Well, that is due to the clash of arms and to victory,
      not to Caesar. Why, how warmly he has welcomed us all! Cassius he has made his legate; Brutus he has made governor of Gaul;
      Sulpicius of Greece; Marcellus, with whom he was more indignant than any one, he has recalled with every consideration for
      his honour. <note type="footnote" n="c">c See iv. 4. 3.</note> What then is the import of all this? It means <note

      penalized by publicity, my mistake is corrected by banishment, though the charge against me amounts to no more than my
      having spoken ill of an adversary when I was actually in arms against him. There is not a man among us, I imagine, who <note

      other object, even at that very moment, I say, did not utter a prayer for the earliest possible defeat of Caesar. If this
      never enters his mind, his bliss is unalloyed; if he knows it, and is convinced of it, why is he angry with a man who has

      avoid the pitfall of scurrility; self-praise is always fettered, for one fears the vice of self-assertiveness is not far
      behind it. The only theme in which you have a free hand is praise of another, any disparagement of whom will inevitably be

      you would make another book of it altogether. As to my journey to Asia, <note type="footnote" n="a">a Caecina wished to go

      urging you in particular to act for me? Well, you see the time has come when my case must be definitely settled. It is no
      good, my dear Cicero, waiting for my son. He is but a young man, and, whether because of his impetuosity, or his

      is you who seize with characteristic penetration upon the points which rejoice the heart and take the fancy of Caesar.
      Everything must originate with you, and be brought to an issue through your instrumentality. You have much influence with
      the great man himself, more than anyone with all his friends. If you convince yourself of the one fact that this <note

      would not in the slightest degree affect your interests. Now that you have been informed what you are permitted to do, I
      think you ought to know what my own idea is. When all this had been settled a letter was delivered <note type="margin" n="2"
       >2</note> to me from you, in which you ask my advice as to what I suggest you should do, whether you should settle down in
      Sicily or set out to finish off your arrears of business in Asia. Your discussing alternatives in this way did not seem to
      me to fit in with what Largus said. He spoke to me in such a way as to imply that you were not at liberty to remain in
      Sicily any longer, whereas you discuss the question as though that permission had been given you. But whether the latter or
      the former is the truth, my own opinion is that you ought to stay in Sicily. The proximity of the island to Rome will help
      you, whether in carrying your point by the frequent interchange of letters and messengers, or in expediting your return,
      when the matter is either arranged according to your request, as I hope it will be, or settled once for all in some other

      CICERO TO FURFANIUS, PROCONSUL OF SICILY (enclosed in the preceding letter) Nobody could possibly be on terms of more <note
       n="marg">1</note> familiar intimacy with anybody than I have always been with Aulus Caecina. For not only did I enjoy much
      of the society of that distinguished man and gallant gentleman, his father, but for this Caecina from his very boyhood, both
      because he gave me great hopes of high integrity and extraordinary eloquence, and also because our lives were very closely
      knit together by the mutual favours of friendship as well as by community of tastes—for him, I say, I have always had such
      an affection that there was no man in the world with whom I lived on terms of greater intimacy. I need write no more. You
      see for yourself how <note type="margin" n="2">2</note> necessary it is for me to look after his welfare and property in

      Rome, September (?), 46 B. C. How highly I esteem and always have esteemed <note type="margin" n="1">1</note> you, and how
      highly I am assured you esteem me, I can testify for myself. For I have been much troubled by your policy, or rather your
      misfortune, in remaining too long in civil war, and the present result—that the recovery of your estate and position takes
      more time than it properly should, and than I could have wished—is no less an anxiety to me than my misfortunes have always
      been to you. I have accordingly revealed my inmost thoughts to Postumulenus and Sestius and, oftener than to anyone, to our
      friend Atticus, and most recently of all to your freedman Theudas, and frequently assured each of them individually that I
      desired in every possible way to satisfy your own and your children's expectations; and I should be glad if you would write
      to your people to the effect that they must consider all I can command, at any rate,—my endeavours, advice, possessions, and
      loyalty—as at their beck and call for any purpose whatever. Did I possess that influence and popularity which, in <note

      which is still mine to promise, but also whatever besides I seem to myself still to retain out of the remnants, as it were,
      of my old-time dignity.. For Caesar himself, as I have been able to gather from many indications, is not unfavourably
      inclined to me, and practically all his most intimate friends also, being, as it so happens, under an obligation to me" for
      signal services in the past, are showing me marked attention and respect. And so, if I find any way open to me to deal with
      the matter of your fortunes, that is to say, your reinstatement in your rights—for everything depends upon that and what
      they tell me makes me daily more disposed to be hopeful about it—then I shall deal with it personally and energetically. I
      need not go into details. All my devotion and <note type="margin" n="3">3</note> friendliness I lay at your feet without
      reserve. But it is of great importance to me that all your people should know this, and all that is required is a letter
      from you, so that they may understand that whatever belongs to Cicero is at the disposal of Trebianus. My object in doing
      this is to convince them that nothing is so difficult but that my undertaking it on your behalf would be a pleasure. </p>

      wisdom you were bearing the injustice of the times, and how profoundly comforted you were by the consciousness of what you
      have done, and had it in your mind to do. Well, if this is what you are doing, you are reaping the rich reward of the

      in the whole of history (and I am no novice myself either, though with studies I have perhaps had less to do than I could
      wish, and with practical affairs even more than I could wish), I pledge you my word that the bitter injustice you are
      suffering will not be of long duration, and that for two reasons—the very man who has supreme power is himself daily, I

     <p> man alive. And as to your restoration, I congratulate you upon it so whole-heartedly, that you would please me better by
      offering me your congratulations than by thanking me; I can well dispense with your doing the latter, and you can do the
      former without insincerity. For the rest, now that your high character and <note type="margin" n="2">2</note> merits have
      thrown open to you the way of return to your family, it befits your wisdom and magnanimity to forget what you have lost, and
      to reflect upon what you have recovered. You will live with your own people, you will live with us. You have gained more in
      prestige than you have lost in private property; though you would get more pleasure out of the former too, if only there
      were any commonwealth in existence. Vestorius, <note type="footnote" n="a">a A banker of Puteoli.</note> our common friend,
      writes to me that you say you are profoundly grateful to me. That you should speak out so frankly is very gratifying to me,
      and I have not the slightest objection to your doing so in the presence of others, and particularly of course in the
      presence of our friend Siro. <note type="footnote" n="b">b An Epicurean philosopher, who taught Virgil.</note> For it is my

     <p> felicity, and then be suddenly crushed and so cast down that nothing could ever afterwards raise your spirits even to the
      point of composure. I have pleaded your cause more openly than my own political position warranted; for the very misfortune
      of my diminished influence was outweighed by my affection and my unceasing love for you, which you have yourself so
      assiduously fostered. All the promises bearing upon your return and restoration have been confirmed, certified, and
      ratified; I have seen, examined, taken part in everything. In fact, opportunely enough, I have all Caesar's <note
       type="margin" n="2">2</note> intimate friends so closely bound to me by familiar acquaintance and kindly feeling that,
      after him, they account me next. This Pansa, <note type="footnote" n="a">a C. Vibius Pansa loyally supported Caesar, who in
       46 gave him the government of Cisalpine Gaul, and in 44 nominated him consul for 43 with Hirtius. Pansa was defeated by
       Antonius at Forum Gallorum in February 43, and mortally wounded, the victor being defeated on the same day by
       Hirtius.</note> Hirtius, <note type="footnote" n="b">b Aulus Hirtius, having joined Octavius, relieved Mutina when besieged
       by Antonius, whom he overcame in battle, but was himself slain.</note> Balbus, <note type="footnote" n="c">c L. Cornelius
       Balbus was a native of Gades, but Caesar made him his praefectus fabrum, thus enabling him to amass a huge fortune. After
       Caesar's death he joined Octavius, and was consul in 40, being the first foreigner to hold that office.</note> Oppius,

      should not, considering the nature of the times, regret having made such efforts. But in no respect have I played the
      time-server. Here my old ties of friendship with all these men come in, and I have never ceased to plead with them on your
      behalf. My chief support, however, I have found in Pansa (a man devotedly attached to you, and anxious to be friends with
      me), since he had influence with Caesar, not less because of his strong personality than </p>

      has litteras, confecta iam res futura sit. Pansa quidem mihi, gravis homo et certus, non solum confirmavit, verum etiam
      recepit, perceleriter se ablaturum diploma. Mihi tamen placuit haec ad te perscribi. Minus enim te firmum sermo Eppuleiae

     <p> because Caesar liked him. Tillius Cimber <note type="footnote" n="a">a L. Tillius Cimber, a friend of Caesar, but
       subsequently one of his murderers.</note> also has given me complete satisfaction. For it is not self-seeking petitions
      that carry weight with Caesar, so much as those based on the petitioner's duty to a friend; and as the latter was the case
      with Cimber, he had more influence than he could possibly have had on behalf of anyone else. Your passport has not been
      given you at once, <note type="margin" n="3">3</note> because of the astounding rascality of certain persons who would have
      bitterly resented any pardon being extended to you, whom they call "the trumpet of civil war," and perpetually talk as
      though they were not delighted that that war had occurred. And this is why we thought that we should act with some degree of
      secrecy, and that it should by no means be published abroad that your affairs had already been settled. But it will be so
      very shortly, and I have no doubt that, when you read this letter, the whole business will have been completed. Pansa
      indeed, a man of weight and to be trusted, not only asseverated, but pledged himself that he would procure the passport
      without a moment's delay. Anyhow I thought it best that you should have a full account of what has happened; for your wife
      Eppuleia's oral report and Ampia's tears plainly showed me that you are not quite so unperturbed as your letter would lead
      me to believe. Moreover, it was their opinion that when they themselves were no longer with you, you would be in a far more
      anxious state of mind. And so I deemed it highly essential for the alleviation of your distress and sorrow that the real
      facts of the case should be fully reported to you as real facts. You know that I have hitherto been in the habit <note

     <p> of writing to you in such a way as rather to console a brave and wise man than to lay before you any assured hope of your
      restoration, except what, once this conflagration had been extinguished, I thought might justly be expected from the
      Republic itself. Remind yourself of your own letters to me, in which you have ever displayed a high spirit, resolute, and
      prepared to bear whatever might befall; and I was not surprised at it when I remembered that you had been engaged in public
      affairs from the earliest years of your life, and that the tenure of your public offices coincided with the most critical
      periods in the welfare and fortunes of the whole community; yes, and that you entered this very war not merely to play the
      happy victor, but also, should it so befall, if vanquished, the philosopher. In the next place, since you devote your
      literary <note type="margin" n="5">5</note> activities to putting on record the exploits of men of courage, it is your duty
      to reflect that you cannot afford to do anything to disprove your own close resemblance to those whom you eulogize. But this
      sort of talk would be better suited to those times from which you have now escaped. As it is you have only to prepare
      yourself to join with us in enduring present conditions; could I but discover a remedy for them, I should pass that same on
      to you. We have, however, one refuge—that learning and literature of which we have always availed ourselves; in prosperity
      we regarded them as a source of pleasure only, now we regard them as our very salvation. But, to revert to what I said at
      first, you must never have any doubt but that everything connected with your restoration and return has been fully
      accomplished. </p>

       pardoned, was not allowed to return to Italy. Being prosecuted by Q. Tubero on a charge of perduellio for his conduct in
       Africa (i.e., supporting Juba against the Romans), he was defended by Cicero in an admirable speech, still extant, which
       moved Caesar to sanction his return.</note> Rome, August or September, 46 B. C. Although at such a crisis in your life it
      was incumbent <note type="margin" n="1">1</note> upon me in view of our friendship to write you something that would either
      cheer or help you, still I have not hitherto done so because it seemed to me that I could not either mitigate or alleviate
      your sorrow by anything I could say. But as soon as I began to feel really hopeful that we should very soon find you
      reinstated in your civil rights, I could not refrain from sending you a clear statement of my sentiments and wishes. In the
      first place then let me tell you what is <note type="margin" n="2">2</note> obvious and clear to me, and that is that Caesar
      will not be too hard upon you; circumstances, lapse of time, public opinion, and, I am inclined to think, his own
      disposition, are making him daily more lenient; and while that is what I feel about the others, I am also told that it is so
      in your case by his most intimate friends, to whom I have not ceased to make supplication in common with your brothers, ever
      since the news first came from Africa. <note type="footnote" n="b">b Of Caesar's victory at Thapsus on Apr. 6, 46 B.

      himself is not prepared to make. But if it takes more time than we could wish, it <note type="margin" n="3">3</note> is

     <p> petuntur, aditus ad eum difficiliores fuerunt; et simul, Africanae causae iratior, diutius velle videtur eos habere
      sollicitos, a quibus se putat diuturnioribus esse molestiis conflictatum. Sed hoc ipsum intellegimus eum quotidie remissius
      et placatius ferre. Quare mihi crede et memoriae manda, me tibi id affirmasse, <note type="margin" n="4">4</note> te in
      istis molestiis diutius non futurum. Quando, quid sentirem, exposui, quid velim tua causa, re potius quam oratione,
      declarabo. Et, si tantum possem, quantum in ea republica, de qua ita sum meritus, ut tu existimas, posse debebam, ne tu
      quidem in istis incommodis esses; eadem enim causa opes meas fregit, quae tuam salutem in discrimen adduxit. Sed tamen,
      quidquid imago veteris meae dignitatis, quidquid reliquiae gratiae valebunt, studium, consilium, opera, gratia, fides mea
      nullo loco deerit tuis optimis <note type="margin" n="5">5</note> fratribus. Tu fac habeas fortem animum, quem semper
      habuisti, primum ob eas causas, quas scripsi, deinde, quod ea de republica semper voluisti atque sensisti, ut non modo
      secunda sperare debeas, sed etiam, si omnia adversa essent, tamen conscientia et factorum et consiliorum tuorum, quaecumque

     <p> has been unusually difficult to approach him; and just now, as the African disaffection<note type="footnote" n="a">a He
       refers to those—Metellus Scipio, Cato, Petreius, and others—who continued to prosecute the war in Africa after the battle
       of Pharsalia.</note> has roused his particular indignation, I fancy he is inclined to keep on tenterhooks for a longer
      spell those who he thinks have given him a longer spell of trouble and annoyance. But even in regard to this we find him to
      be daily more yielding and conciliatory. You must therefore take my word for it, and make a mental note of it, that I have
      given you this specific assurance, that the painful position you are in will not last much longer. Now that you have my
      candid opinion, what my <note type="margin" n="4">4</note> wishes are in your interests will appear from what I do rather
      than from what I say. Had I as much power as I ought to have in a state- of which I have deserved as well as you, at any
      rate, consider I have, neither would you be so unfortunately situated as you are; for my ascendancy has been destroyed, and
      your welfare jeopardized, by one and the same cause. But for all that, so far as the shadow of my former position, so far as
      the little that is left of my popularity avails, my zeal and counsel, my efforts, influence, and loyalty will invariably be
      at the disposal of your excellent brothers. See to it that you on your part maintain that <note type="margin" n="5">5</note>
      spirit of courage you have always maintained, firstly for the reason I have given you; secondly because your political
      aspirations and sentiments have always been such as not only to justify your looking forward to a prosperous future, but
      also, if your future were in all respects the reverse, to make it your duty, conscious as you are of all you have done and
      purposed to do, to face every eventuality with a high and heroic spirit. </p>

      regard for you, but your brothers also, to whom I am as warmly attached as to yourself, are so singularly dutiful to you in
      their brotherly affection that they make it impossible for me to omit any act or opportunity that may prove my eager desire

      from mine. On the other hand I should like to give you my own account of my hopes, indeed my confident and certain
      assurance, of your restoration. If any man in the world is a coward in matters of importance involving any risk, and always
      more inclined to apprehend an unfavourable, than to hope for a favourable, issue, I am that man; and if this be a weakness,
      I admit that I am not free from it. But for all that, pessimist as I am, when, four <note type="margin" n="2">2</note> days

      additional reason which increases my longing for it, and that is the promise you make in your letter; for you write that in
      that event you will spend your days in my company. It is a great pleasure to me that you should wish <note type="margin"
       n="2">2</note> to do so, and your wish is in exact accord with our intimate friendship, and the opinions of me expressed
      from time to time by that prince of men, your father. For let me assure you that while those who have been, or still are,
      according to the vicissitudes of the times, in a position to help you are more closely hound to you by the magnitude of
      their services, there is no man more closely so bound by the ties of friendship than myself. And that is why I am so
      delighted at your not only remembering our intimacy, but even wishing to increase it. </p>

     <p> XVIII CICERO TO QUINTUS LEPTA <note type="footnote" n="a">a Cf, iii. 7. 4 and 9. 13. Lepta had been Cicero's praefectus
       fabrum in Cilicia. He had been a Pompeian, but was now applying to Caesar for some contract in connexion with the public
       games given by the latter this year. See the next Letter.</note> Rome, January, 45 B. C. As soon as I received your letter
      from the hand of <note type="margin" n="1">1</note> your freedman Seleucus, I at once sent a note to Balbus, asking him what
      was in the law. <note type="footnote" n="b">b The Lex Iulia Municipalis. Auctioneers were regarded with detestation, like
       pawnbrokers and usurers with us, as trading on the misfortunes of others, and were therefore excluded from the municipal
       magistracy and senate.— Tyrrell.</note> His answer was that while those who were actually in business as auctioneers were
      forbidden to be municipal councillors, those who had retired were not so forbidden. So your friends and mine must be of good
      heart; for it would be intolerable if, when men who were at this moment practising divination <note type="footnote" n="c">c
       Cicero alludes to one Ruspina, a diviner, whom Caesar had made a Roman senator. Haruspices were excluded from the Roman
       Senate as being foreigners, and perhaps also as taking money for their services.</note> were being elected on the Senate at
      Rome, men who had at any time practised as auctioneers should not be allowed to be councillors in the provincial towns.
      There is no news of either of the Spains. It is <note type="margin" n="2">2</note> certain, however, that Pompey <note
       type="footnote" n="d">d Gnaeus, the elder son of Pompey the Great.</note>d has a large army; for Caesar himself sent me a
      copy of Paciaecus's <note type="footnote" n="e">e L. Iunius Paciaecus is mentioned in De bello Hispanlensi as a
       distinguished and capable man, a native of Spain, whom Caesar sent to relieve Utica when besieged by Pompey.</note>
      dispatch, in which the number of legions there is stated to be eleven. Messala <note type="footnote" n="f">f M. Valerius
       Messala, consul in 52 B. C.</note> also has written to Quintus Salassus that his brother <note type="footnote" n="g">g
       i.e., Q. Salassus's brother.</note> Publius Curtius was executed by order of Pompey before the eyes of the army, for having
      arranged, as was alleged, with certain Spaniards that, when Pompey had arrived at some town or other to negotiate for
      supplies, they should arrest him and take him to Caesar. </p>

      consideration of no trivial importance, that you can get away from where you are, as soon as you hear anything definite, at

      upon you if defeated, or enslavement if victorious. And therefore I, whom those wise and gallant men, the Domitii and

     <p> and so I undoubtedly was; I was afraid that that would come to pass, which actually did happen,— am now on the contrary
      afraid of nothing, and there is no contingency for which I am not prepared. While some degree of precaution seemed
      practicable, it pained me to see that precaution neglected; as it is, however, amid this universal ruin, when a policy of
      prudence can do no good, it seems that the one course left to us is to bear whatever happens with self-restraint, especially
      since death is the end of all things, and my conscience tells me that as long as I had the chance I took steps to protect
      the dignity, and when that was lost, that I was eager to maintain the safety, of the Republic. I have written thus, not
      because I want to talk <note type="margin" n="2">2</note> about myself, but so that you, who have always been so closely

     <p> XXII CICERO TO CN. DOMITIUS AHENOBARBUS <note type="footnote" n="a">a Son of Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, a staunch
       aristocrat, who was compelled by his own troops to surrender to Caesar at Corfinium in 49. He commanded Pompey's left wing
       at the battle of Pharsalia, and fell by the hand of Antony. His son Gnaeus, to whom Cicero writes, was also present at
       Pharsalia, but was pardoned by Caesar, and returned to Italy in 46, after the battle of Thapsus in that year. He was
       inclined in his despair to join the remnants of the Pompeian party in Spain, but Cicero had dissuaded him from doing
       so.</note> Rome, month uncertain, 46 B. C. It was not the fact of your having sent me no <note type="margin" n="1">1</note>
      letter that put me off writing to you after your arrival in Italy; no, it was because I could not think of any promise I
      could make you, being myself utterly destitute, or of any course of action I could recommend, having no policy whatever of
      my own, or of any consolation I could offer you in these terrible times. Although the present situation shows no improvement
      whatever and is even far more hopeless than it was, still I thought that a letter from me with nothing in it would be better
      than no letter at all. If I believed that you had attempted in the <note type="margin" n="2">2</note> interests of the state
      to undertake a task <note type="footnote" n="b">b i.e., to follow your uncle Cato to Africa and fight there.</note> beyond
      your power to accomplish, I should still urge you, to the best of my ability, to accept such terms of life as were offered
      you, and were available. But seeing that you have resolved that the policy you so honourably and gallantly adopted should
      cease from the very moment when it had pleased fortune herself to put an end to our struggles, <note type="footnote" n="c">c
       By the defeat of Pompey at Pharsalia.</note> I beg and implore of you in the name of our old and intimate connexion and of
      my most sincere affection for you, and of yours, just as sincere, for myself, to keep yourself out of harm for all our
      sakes, for the sake of your mother, <note type="footnote" n="d">d Porcia, sister of Cato of Utica.</note> your wife, and all
      your family, to whom you are and always have been </p>

     <p> carissimus, salvum conserves; incolumitati tuae tuorumque, qui ex te pendent, consulas; quae didicisti, quaeque ab
      adolescentia pulcherrime a sapientissimis viris tradita, memoria et scientia comprehendisti, iis hoc tempore utare; quos
      coniunctos summa benevolentia plurimisque officiis amisisti, eorum desiderium, si non aequo animo, at forti feras. <note
       n="marg">3</note> Ego, quid possim, nescio, vel potius me parum posse sentio; illud tamen tibi polliceor, me, quaecumque
      saluti dignitatique tuae conducere arbitrabor, tanto studio esse facturum, quanto semper tu et studio et officio in meis
      rebus fuisti. Hanc meam voluntatem ad matrem tuam, optimam feminam tuique amantissimam, detuli. Si quid ad me scripseris,
      ita faciam,' ut te velle intellexero. Sin autem tu minus scripseris, ego tamen omnia, quae tibi utilia esse arbitrabor,
      summo studio diligenterque curabo. Vale. </p>

     <p> most dear; to take thought for your own safety and that of those who are dependent upon you; Io apply to the present
      crisis all the lessons you have learned, all the wisdom bequeathed you by the greatest philosophers, which you have so
      admirably stored in your memory and assimilated in mind from the days of your early manhood; and finally, to bear, if not
      with calmness, at least with courage, your yearning for those bound to you by the strongest ties of affection and a thousand
      acts of kindness— the friends you have now lost. <note type="footnote" n="a">a What Domitius had done, or signified his
       intention of doing, to call for so long and earnest an exhortation, must remain unknown. Perhaps he had threatened to join
       the Pompeian party in Spain, which Tyrrell and Purser consider more likely than that he contemplated suicide.</note> What I
      can do myself, I know not, or rather I <note type="margin" n="3">3</note> feel that what I can do is all too little; this
      much, however, I promise you, that whatever I deem conducive to your welfare and honour, that I will do with as much
      earnestness as you have consistently shown, and effectively too, in dealing with my affairs. These good intentions of mine I
      have conveyed to your mother, who is the best of women and most devoted to you. If you send me any message, I shall act in
      accord ance with what I conceive to be your wishes; but even if you fail to do so, I shall none the less attend most
      zealously and assiduously to whatever I consider to be to your advantage. Farewell. </p>
