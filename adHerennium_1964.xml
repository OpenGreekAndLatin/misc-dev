    <p> INTRODUCTION The Greek art of rhetoric was first naturalized at Rome in the time of the
        younger Scipio, and Latin treatises on the subject were in circulation from the time of the
        Gracchi. But the books by Cato, Antonius, and the other Roman writers have not come down to
        us, and it is from the second decade of the first century B.C. that we have, in the treatise
        addressed to Gaius Herennius, the oldest Latin Art preserved entire. Like Cicero's
        incomplete De Inventione, which belongs close to it in time, this work reflects Hellenistic
        rhetorical teaching. Our author, however, gives us a Greek art in Latin dress, combining a
        Roman spirit with Greek doctrine. It is a technical manual, systematic and formal in
        arrangement; its exposition is bald, but in greatest part clear and precise. Indeed the
        writer's specific aims are to achieve clarity and conciseness, and to complete the
        exposition of his subject with reasonable speed. He seeks clarity through the use of Roman
        terms, and of specially selected examples; he seeks conciseness by keeping practical needs
        always in view, by scrupulously avoiding irrelevant matter, and by presenting methods and
        principles, not a host of particular illustrations of a given point.<note type="footnote"

    <p> time on, as a work by Cicero <note type="footnote" n="a">a The uncritical editor who, before
            Jerome's time, made this ascription may also have been responsible for the division of
            the work into six books. He may have thought the untitled work Cicero's because of its
            resemblance to De Inventione, and may have interpreted the inchoata ac rudia of De
            Oratore 1. 2. 5 as referring to two distinct works. An interesting interpolation, based
            on the belief in Ciceronian authorship, appears in the MSS. at 1. xii. 20: [Tullius]
            heres meus [Terentiae] uxori meae.</note> gave it a prestige which it enjoyed for over a
        thousand years. Because of its position in the MSS. following De Inventione it was in the
        twelfth century called Rhetorica Secunda; perhaps because of a belief that Cicero wrote the
        treatise to replace his juvenile De Inventione, it was later called Rhetorica Nova. <note
            type="footnote" n="b">b For like parallel designations of literary works m the Middle
            Ages, see E. R. Curtius, Europäische Literatur und lateinisches Mittelalter, Bern, 1948,
            p. 161.</note> But Cicero never refers to any work of his which might be identified with
        our treatise; the disparaging reference in De Oratore 1. 2. 5 to those " crude and
        incomplete " essays of his youth is obviously to the two books De Inventione. The picture we
        draw of our author does not fit the early Cicero, and his doctrines in many crucial
        instances, as will be seen later, are in sharp contrast with those of De Inventione.
        Furthermore, the thought and style of the work are unworthy of the mature Cicero. Finally
        Quintilian <note type="footnote" n="c">c It is argued, for example, that if Quintilian at 4.
            5. 3. where he considers the view that the propositions in a Partition should not exceed
            three (cf. the like principle for the Enumeration in our treatise, 1. x. 17), or at 3.
            6. 45.. where he deals with the three Types of Issue (cf, our treatise, L x. 18), had
            known that these were identical with, or akin to, Ciceronian notions, he would not have
            kept silent on the point.</note> (who often cites De Inventione),<note type="footnote"
            n="d">d Usually under the title Libri Rhetorici.</note>
    </p>

    <pb n="ix"/>
    <p> and similarly Gellius,<note type="footnote" n="a">a Gellius, 13. 6. 4, says that he has been
            unable to discover whether the term barbarismus was used before the Augustan age; cf,
            our treatise, 4. xii. 17.</note> Marius Victorinus, Servius, and Cassiodorus show no
        acquaintance with any Ciceronian work of this nature. Although the belief in Ciceronian
        authorship has still not entirely disappeared, all the recent editors agree that the
        attribution is erroneous. The first to doubt that the treatise was worthy of Ciceronian
        authorship was Lorenzo Valla (middle saec. xv). Then Raphael Regius in 1491 positively
        divorced the work from Cicero's name. The question of authorship has occupied the attention
        of scholars at intervals ever since, but has never been settled to the satisfaction of all.
        It is wisest, I believe, to ascribe the work to an unknown author, although a good many
        reputable scholars have made out a case, at first glance attractive, for assigning it to a
        rhetorician named Cornificius.<note type="footnote" n="b">b The first to ascribe the work
            with assurance to Cornificius was Petrus Victorius in 1582; Regius had vacillated,
            assigning it variously to Cornificius, Verginius Flavus, and Timolaüs. Recent scholars
            who have upheld the theory of Cornifician authorship are Johannes Tolkiehn, Jahresb. des
            philol. Vereins zu Berlin 45 (1919). 73, and Wilhelm Kroll, Glotta 22 (1934). 24, and
            Philologus 89 (1934). 63.</note> These rely on citations in Quintilian which correspond
        with passages in Book 4 of our treatise. Cornificius is mentioned, and always with
        disapproval, in the following places: In 5.10. 2 Quintilian, discussing arguments,
        criticizes Cornificius for calling a Conclusion from Incompatibles contrarium; contrarium
        appears in our treatise as a figure (of diction). In 9. 2. 27 Quintilian tells us that
        oratio libera— which he would allow to be called a figure only if it is </p>

    <pb n="x"/>
    <p> simulated and artfully designed—is by Cornificius called licentia; licentia is the term used
        by our author (4. xxxvi. 48) for a figure which, in one form, fulfils Quintilian's
        requirements. In 9. 3. 69-71 Quintilian, dealing with adnominatio, gives three examples of
        flat punning to be avoided, not imitated; Cornificius, he says, calls this wordplay
        traductio. Two of these examples are used by our author, one to illustrate traductio (4.
        xiv. 21), but the other to illustrate adnominatio (4. xxi. 29). To meet this real
        difficulty, the advocates of Cornifician authorship maintain that adnominatio and traductio
        are brought together by Quintilian because they are indeed kindred figures, but these
        scholars are forced also to blame Quintilian for casual excerpting at this point, or for
        drawing upon his memory—a charge hard to prove against so careful a workman. In 9. 3. 91
        Quintilian criticizes Cornificius and Rutilius for regarding finitio, which is no figure at
        all, as a figure of diction; definitio, somewhat differently characterized, appears as a
        figure of diction in our treatise (4. xxv. 35). In 9. 3. 98 Quintilian tells us that
        Cornificius lists ten figures of diction of which the first five must be regarded as figures
        of thought: interrogatio (cf. 4. xv. 22), ratiocinatio (4. xvi. 23), subiectio (4. xxiii.
        33), transitio (4. xxvi. 35), occultatio (4. xxvii. 37), and the other five as not figures
        at all: sententia (4. xvii. 24), membrum (4. xix. 26), articuli (articulus = 4. xix. 26),
        interpretatio (4. xxviii. 38), conclusio (4. xxx. 41).<note type="footnote" n="a">a Georg
            Thiele, Gött. gel. Anz., 1892 (2). 725 ff., compares the order of the figures in this
            passage with that which they<pb n="xi"/>follow in our treatise, and sees in the
            comparison an argument for Cornifician authorship; Curtius Koehler, De Rhetoricis ad
            Herennium, Berlin, 1909, pp. 8 ff., presents the refutation.</note> These all appear in
        our treatise, in the places indicated in parentheses. </p>

    <pb n="xi"/>
    <p> Quintilian mentions Cornificius in two other places. In 3. 1. 21, sketching the history of
        writers on rhetoric, lie says: “Cornificius wrote a great deal (non pauca) on the same
        subject (rhetoric), Stertinius something, and the elder Gallio <note type="footnote" n="a">a
            Long survived the elder Seneca, who died c. A.D. 39.</note> a little. But the
        predecessors of Gallio, Celsus and Laenas,<note type="footnote" n="b">b Both A. Cornelius
            Celsus and Popilius Laenas fl. under Tiberius.</note> and in our own day Verginius,<note
            type="footnote" n="c">c Verginius Flavus fl. under Nero.</note> Pliny,<note
            type="footnote" n="d">d The Elder (A.D. 23/4-79).</note> and Tutilius wrote with greater
        care. And even today there are distinguished authors. . . ." To this passage may be joined
        9. 3. 89, where Cornificius appears in a list of authors who devoted whole books (non partem
        operis . . . sed proprie libros) to the discussion of figures: “Caecilius, Dionysius,<note
            type="footnote" n="e">e Both Caecilius and Dionysius fl. under Augustus.</note>
            Rutilius,<note type="footnote" n="f">f P. Rutilius Lupus fl. in the late Augustan
            period.</note> Cornificius, Visellius, and a number of others, although there are living
        authors whose glory will match theirs.” <note type="footnote" n="g">g In five other places
            Quintilian gives examples which, with greater or less completeness, appear also in our
            treatise: 9. 3. 31 (complexio, 4. xiv. 20); 9. 3. 56 (gradatio, 4. xxv. 34); two
            examples in 9. 3. 72 (adnominatio, 4. xxii. 30 and 4.xxi. 29), the wording of one
            differing slightly, that of the other a great deal, from that in our treatise; 9. 3. 85
            (ἀντιμεταβολή= commutatio, 4. xxviii. 39); 9. 3. 88 (dubitatio, 4. xxix. 40). None of
            these examples is assigned by Quintilian to Cornificius or to any other author; whether
            they appeared in Cornificius' book and were from there borrowed by Quintilian we cannot
            know. Some or all of these examples may have been common to a number of manuals. The
            well-known remark attributed to Socrates (" I do not live to eat, but eat to live "),
                which<pb n="xii"/>Quintilian uses as an example in 9. 3. 85, he may have found in a
            Greek source.</note>
    </p>

    <pb n="xii"/>
    <p> An examination of these passages, especially in their context, leads us to several
        conclusions. First, Cornificius lived after the time of Cicero and near (but before)
        Quintilian's own day. In 3. 1. 8 ff. Quintilian is obviously preserving a chronological
        order: Cornificius appears after Cicero (rather than immediately after Antonius) and before
        the writers aetatis nostrae. Again, in 9. 3. 91 and 9. 3. 98-9 Cornificius, Caecilius, and
        Rutilius are mentioned following discussions of Cicero. Finally, in 9. 3. 89 Cornificius is
        listed with writers of the Augustan age, and we assume that he was contemporary with them or
        flourished soon after them.<note type="footnote" n="a">a The efforts that have been made to
            identify Cornificius with any one of that name who lived at this time have come to
            nought. Nor have the many scholars who have ascribed our treatise to a Cornificius, and
            so sought to identify him with an earlier bearer of that name, agreed in their
            identification. C. L. Kayser's choice, the Q. Cornificius who with Cicero was candidate
            for the consulship in 64 B.C. was favoured for a time.</note> It would seem preposterous
        to place a writer of Marian times in this group. We further conclude that Cornificius was
        the author of a special book on figures,<note type="footnote" n="b">b It is likely that this
            work did not contain a section on tropes. Quintilian (8. 6. 1 ff.) never cites
            Cornificius on this subject, nor refers to any of the several resemblances, in rules and
            examples, that exist between his treatment and our author's. In large part, however, his
            treatment differs from our author's. If Cornificius had discussed tropes, it is perhaps
            safe to assume that passages from his book would have been excerpted by Quintilian.
            Again, in 9. 1. 2 Quintilian mentions Proculus as among the writers who call tropes
            "figures"; our author, too, attaches the tropes to the<pb n="xiii"/>figures in this way
            (4. xxxi. 42), but Quintilian does not name Cornificius along with Proculus. The
            separation of tropes from figures was first made, we think, in the Augustan age. If
            Cornificius dealt only with figures, that fact, too, might be evidence for placing him
            at a time not earlier than that period.</note> and that this is </p>

    <pb n="xiii"/>
    <p> the source from which Quintilian makes his citations in Book 9. That Cornificius produced
        additional work in the field of rhetoric is possible; <note type="footnote" n="a">a Marx,
            however, believes that Cornificius wrote only the special work on figures.</note> the
        phrase non pauca in 3. i. 21, however, does not permit us to be certain whether this was in
        the form of a complete Art of rhetoric,<note type="footnote" n="b">b Thiele (Gött. gel.
            Anz.) and Ammon believe that it was such a complete Art of rhetoric. Thiele identifies
            it with our treatise; the special book on figures was a portion (= Bk. 4) of this Art.
            Ammon (Blätter, pp. 409 ff.) argues as follows: The division, in the MSS., of Book 4
            (which is especially large) into three books indicates that we have in our treatise a
            contamination of Cornificius' complete Art and his special work on figures. The " Art "
            extends to 4. xiii. 18, at the end of which there is a lacuna; 4. i. 1 to 4. xiii. 18
            corresponds to " Book iv " of the MSS. The special book on figures also perhaps included
            two books; " Book v," dealing with figures of diction, extends from 4. xiii. 19 to 4.
            xxxiv. 46, and " Book vi," treating figures of thought, extends from 4. xxxv. 47 to the
            end. In the union a portion of the complete Art of rhetoric was lost—a short exposition
            of the two types of figures, and the beginning of their treatment. That Cornificius'
            attitude towards the use of one's own examples differed in the two works Ammon thinks is
            not significant. But Ammon's hypothesis is not acceptable, since the division into four
            books follows from the author's own words; the lacuna at 4. xiii. 18 is brief (only a
            transition is indicated); neither are the first three books of uniform length; and the
            author's special interest in ornatus justifies the length of Book 4, which in any event
            may as it stands lay claim to unity.</note> or of several works on single parts of the
        subject. </p>

    <pb n="xiv"/>
    <p> Cornificius, then, lived in a later period than our author, and so cannot have written the
        Rhetorica ad Herennium. The book by Cornificius which Quintilian cites is not the Rhetorica
        ad Herennium, and there is no evidence that Quintilian knew or made use of our
            treatise.<note type="footnote" n="a">a Further arguments (see Koehler) rest frankly on
            the argumentum e silentio. For example, Quintilian often refers to Cicero's De
            Inventione but never mentions the agreements between that work and "Cornificius." Again,
            in 9. 2. 54 he lists four terms used for the figure Aposiopesis, but not the term used
            by our author (praecisio, 4. xxx. 41); this silence leads some to question whether, had
            he known our treatise, he would not in such cases as this have referred to the terms our
            author employs. Or again, in 9. 3. 99 ἠθοποιία and χαρακτηρισμός are cited from Rutilius
            among figures supplementary to those found in other authors. Since Cornificius has just
            been mentioned, it is inferred that his book lacked these figures; but they appear in
            our treatise as notatio (4. 1. 63) and effictio (4. xlix. 62). Or again, in 3. 6. 45,
            where Verginius Flavus is referred to as favouring the Antonian classification of the
            Types of Issue (cf. our treatise 1. x. 18), Cornificius is not mentioned—but as I should
            remind the reader, the advocates of Cornifician authorship believe that Quintilian was
            not interested in the first three books of our work, or in 4. i. 1-xii. 18, because on
            the subjects there treated he had recourse to better material elsewhere.</note> The
        agreements between Cornificius' work and our author's we explain by assuming a common
            source,<note type="footnote" n="b">b Teuffel-Kroll and others, however, believe that
            Cornificius probably used our treatise directly.</note> and we should remember, too,
        that some of the matter, especially some of the examples, shared by both can be classed
        among the commonplaces of the subject. Who, finally, was the real author? We have no
        evidence to determine that question, and so must assign the work to an auctor incertus.<note

    <p> The original title is as unknown to us as the name of the author. Marx, on the basis of the
        introductory remarks in Rook 1, suggests, with plausibility, that this might have been De
        Ratione Dicendi, which was also the title of Antonius' treatise on rhetoric. Our author
        dedicates his work to Gaius Herennius; we know several Herennii <note type="footnote" n="a"
            >a They were of plebeian stock, and were allied to the family of Marius.</note> of this
        period, but no one definitely identifiable with the addressee. Marx, influenced by the
        apparent fact that the work remained unnoticed for five hundred years, believed that it was
        intended only for private use, and not for publication, but this hypothesis does not receive
        universal acceptance. As we have said, the treatise is altogether Greek in doctrine. The
        Rhodian <note type="footnote" n="b">b Many Romans came to Rhodes, a great centre of

        source sought to bind rhetoric to philosophy, and the book as it stands is a synthesis of
        various teachings: pre-Aristotelian (Isocratean and “Anaximenean”), Aristotelian and
        Peripatetic, Stoic, Hermagorean, and possibly Epicurean. Hellenistic theorists selected from
        ail schools what they needed, and indeed some of the precepts were by then a common
            possessions.<note type="footnote" n="c">c Cf. Cicero, De Inx. 2. iii. 8: " [Isocratean

            Interdependence is often hard to trace definitely even in the earlier periods.</note> We
        must remark, too, in our </p>

    <pb n="xvi"/>
    <p> author's case the thoroughly practical motives to which he constantly gives expression. The
        notes in the present volume attempt in many instances to indicate the ties by which he is
        bound to the traditions of different schools. To illustrate briefly* and almost at random:
        the threefold purpose of the Direct Opening is pre-Aristotelian doctrine; the concept of the
        officia oratoris is Aristotelian; the " virtues " of Style go back to Theophrastus; the
        detailed treatment of Delivery belongs probably to post-Theophrastan theory; the discussion
        of Solecism and Barbarism shows a debt to Stoicism; the definition of rhetoric is
        Hermagorean, and so too, though in modified form, is our author's status system—indeed every
        art which had a status system was beholden to Hermagoras; the opposition to amphibolies may
        be Epicurean; and in the case of some principles the Sophists and Plato play an originating
        or participating rôle. The precepts are often illustrated by excellent examples, many of
        them allusions to the recent and the contemporary political scene, especially the Mar-sic
        and Marian Wars, and many bringing back to life the older Roman eloquence. Of the older
        Latin orators, our author shows special admiration for Gaius Gracchus and Crassus (4. i. 2,
        4. ii. 2), but he tells us that Cato, Tiberius Gracchus, Laelius, Scipio, Porcina, and
        Antonius also commonly serve as models in the field of style. Poets and historians, too, may
        be models (4. v. 7); he has praise for Ennius and Pacuvius (4. iv. 7), but he does not </p>

    <pb n="xvii"/>
    <p> hesitate to use these poets and Plautus <note type="footnote" n="a">a And probably also
            Accius; see 2. xxvi. 42.</note> and the historian Coelius Antipater in illustration of
        faults of argumentation or of style. Examples of figures of speech (whose sources he does
        not name) are drawn from Greek authors as well; the speeches of Demosthenes (especially De
        Corona) and Aeschines are special favourites, but sayings originated by Homer, Simonides,
        Pythagoras, Isocrates, Socrates, Theo-phrastus, Aristarchus, Apollonius ὁ μαλακός, and
        others also appear, as do references to Greek mythology. The author's experience and mastery
        of Greek literature, however, do not seem to have been great; this Greek lore was
        transmitted to him from the schools. The schools emphasized declamation and the study of
        models, and the treatise is in this respect an image of school practice. Declamatory
        exercises—the author again and again stresses the importance of exercise <note
            type="footnote" n="b">b But never a word about declaiming in Greek; cf. on the other
            hand the custom followed by Cicero (Brutus 90. 310).</note>—are represented in the form
        of progymnasmata of various types (including training in epideictic), of deliberative
        questions (deliberationes, suasoriae), and of judicial cases (causae, controversiae). The
        deliberative questions are all taken from events of Roman history, none of them antedating
        the war with Hannibal.<note type="footnote" n="c">c For events connected with the Hannibalic
            war Coelius Antipater may have served as a source, for the subsequent period the

        drawn from Roman history, almost all date from the end of the Jugurthine War to the end of
        the Marian War; a number are also Greek in origin, and occasionally are </p>

    <p> altered to fit Roman conditions. Our author doubtless used collections of declamations
        current in his day. The organization of the treatise is rather complicated. <note

        on the partes of the discourse (μόρια λόγου), and the Peripatetic, based on the five officia
        (ἔργα) of rhetoric. In his discussion of judicial oratory—which held the foreground in
        Hellenistic rhetoric, and claims most of his attention—both schemes are fused, " in order to
        make the subject easier to understand " (1. iii. 4), and with interesting results. The
        partes are treated under Invention, and not, as in the Peripatetic system, under
        Disposition. Disposition, which is therefore narrow in scope and rather sterile, becomes an
        adjunct of Invention <note type="footnote" n="b">b The conflation results in certain
            inconsistencies; see, e.g., the reference to Invention at 1. x. 16, and the note on 3.
            x. 17. Certain other inconsistencies in the order are, however, not the result of
            conflation; the author at times in his treatment transposes his original order of topics
            (e.g., in 1. xiv. 24 and 2. xvi. 23; and cf. 1. xiv. 24 ff. with 2. xiv. 21 ff.).</note>
        (3. ix. 16), and is treated directly after it, where in the Peripatetic structure we should
        expect a discussion of Style. The Types of Issue are subjoined to Proof, which is one of the
        partes, and not as in Aristotle a primary and central function of the whole art. The
        discussion of the deliberative and epideictic kinds, on the other hand, is more in line with
        the Peripatetic method: in both cases </p>

    <pb n="xix"/>
    <p> Invention receives first consideration, and then comes the Development of the cause based on
        the parts of the discourse. Each book has a Preface and a Conclusion, which, by brief
        summaries and transitions characteristic of lecture or text-book style, serve to tie the
        parts together, and to keep the plan of the work clear in the reader's mind. The first two
        books deal with Invention in judicial causes; Invention in deliberative and epideictic
        speaking is discussed much more briefly in a part of Book 3. Disposition is also accorded
        little space for the reasons set forth above. But the treatment of Delivery, Memory, and
        Style is of special interest and importance. The doctrine of Delivery had been developed in
        post-Aristotelian times, and our author is familiar with books on the subject. He is
        dissatisfied with these and wishes to treat the subject with greater care and completeness
        than had characterized the work of his predecessors (3. xi. 19). In the section which he
        devotes to Delivery two observations will present themselves to the modern student of public
        speaking. The rules are for the most part prescriptive; the speaker is told precisely what
        use of voice, pause, and gesture he ought consciously to make in a variety of situations.
        And secondly, the doctrine represents a salutary reaction against Asianism; piercing
        exclamations and the continual use of the full voice are more than once reprehended (3. xii.
        21 ff.), and the speaker is more than once warned against imitating the delivery of the
        stage-actor (3. xiv. 24, xv. 26). The section on Memory is our oldest surviving; </p>

    <pb n="xx"/>
    <p> treatment of the subject. Based on visual images and “backgrounds,” the mnemotechnical
        system which it presents exerted an influence traceable to modern times. Here too the author
        refers to previous writers on the subject in order to combat their theory; he specifies that
        these are Greek, but he does not mention any of them by name. In Book 4 we have the oldest
        systematic treatment of Style in Latin, indeed the oldest extant inquiry into the subject
        after Aristotle. It offers, furthermore, the oldest extant division of the kinds of Style
        into three, and the oldest extant formal study of figures. Our author gives more space to
        Style than to any other of the departments of rhetoric, and much more to ornatus—which is
        limited to the figures —than to the other aspects of Style. The exceptionally large
        enumeration of figures is of course more in accord with Isocratean than with Aristotelian
        doctrine; our author, together with the younger Gorgias (through the translation by
        Rutilius), provides us with an important source for our knowledge of Hellenistic theory in
        this field. The treatment of the figures is not always bald and jejune, despite their formal
        array. Occasionally our author writes good literary criticism; read for example the advice,
        anti-Asian in character, which he gives on the use of the Gorgianic figures (4. xxi. 32). He
        is often sensitive to the effect which a figure of speech, well-used, can work upon the
        hearer. He never advocates the tricky cunning which would have justified the scorn that
        Longinus (De Sublim., ch. 17) expressed for the " petty figures (σχημάτια) of the rhetorical
        craftsman." His counsel is for moderation and the consideration of propriety—in the use of

    <p> (4. xv. 22), Maxims (4. xvii. 25), Disjunction (4. xxvii. 38), Onomatopoeia (4. xxxi. 42),
        Metaphor (4. xxxiv. 45), and Comparison (4. xlviii. 61). The author is not always at ease
        among technical terms (see 4. vii. 10, and also 4. x. 15 and 4. xi. 16), since not all of
        these had yet become stable in Latin. Inasmuch as a like difficulty attends the translation
        of his terms into English, I have thought it my duty to readers to use the terms most
        familiar to them; accordingly in rendering the names for the figures I have, abandoning
        strict consistency, used the English derivatives of the author's terms wherever possible, or
        the accepted English equivalents, and have employed terms of Greek origin where their use
        was indicated. A number of questions concerning the treatise are vigorously debated. How old
        was the author when the work was composed? Is the treatise nothing but the notes of lectures
        delivered by his Latin teacher? Does our author favour the populares? What is his
        philosophical bias, if any? And most baffling, what relation does the treatise bear to
        Cicero's De Inventione? Whereas in the nineteenth century it was customary to praise our
        author for " manly independence of thought," it is now, especially since Marx' work <note
            type="footnote" n="a">a See p. xxxvii.</note> appeared, common to make him out an
        uncritical and very young man, or a boy, who copied down, virtually word for word, the
        lectures of his Latin teacher, and worked these up with only slight additions, mostly
        represented by the Introductions and Conclusions to the several Books. The style does show
        puerilities, and signs of immaturity are sought and found here and there in the thought. But
        not </p>

    <pb n="xxii"/>
    <p> everything labelled as puerile by some critics justifies the label, and in some degree the
        charge would have to be shared by the teacher. The confusion between student and teacher
        arises necessarily from the theory that we have here only a student's notebook.<note

        than his kinsman Herennius to have composed the book for his use, and to encourage him in
        industry (1. i. 1; 2. xxxi. 50; 3. xxxiv. 40; 4. lvi. 69), young enough still to practise
        with him (3. i. 1; 4. lvi. 69), and to make plans for the future—he expects to write on
        Grammar (4. xii. 17), on Military Science and State Administration (3. ii. 3), on Memory (3.
        xvi. 28), and (if encouraged) against the dialecticians (2. xi. 16). We have no reason to
        believe that when he speaks of the pressure of private affairs (1. i. 1) and the demands of
        his occupations (1. xvii. 27) he is merely following a literary convention or indulging in
        rhetorical fiction. He charges Greek writers with childish argumentation in respect to the
        use of examples (4. iii. 4), warns against puerilities in the use of Isocolon and
        Paronomasia (4. xx. 27, xxiii. 32), and finds recourse to amphibolies silly (2. xi. 16). His
        apologies for slow progress and references to the magnitude of his task and the care he has
        devoted to it (e.g., 1. xvii. 27; 2. xxxi. 50) are inconsistent with the picture of one who
        is merely working over dictated material. He </p>

    <pb n="xxiii"/>
    <p> professes to have taken pains in assembling his material (conquisite conscripsimus, 1. xxxi.
        50, and studiose collegimus, 4. lvi. 09), and this seems to imply the use of sources,
        although we cannot know how wide this use or how comprehensive his study of them may have
        been. Lecture notes doubtless form the core of the treatise, but the author probably made
        use of other sources as well, and worked the matter over with some degree of independence.
        Some of the very incongruities that we find in the treatise may derive precisely from this
        weaving together of material drawn from a number of places. Dependence on his teacher is
        explicit only in connection with a disputed point, on the number of Types of Issue <note
            type="footnote" n="a">a Who the teacher (noster doctor) here referred to was we do not
            know.</note> (1. x. 18). We go too far if we assume that the precepts all belong to the
        teacher and very little more than the Introductions and Conclusions to the author. And one
        wonders how the teacher would have regarded the release of his own work, even if only for
        private use, as the work of his pupil.<note type="footnote" n="b">b See Schanz, ed. 1909, p.
            470. Quintilian, 1. Pr. 7, regrets that two books of lecture notes, taken down by

            circulation.</note> Does our author favour the Popular party? It is believed that his
        teacher may have belonged to the school of L. Plotius Gallus and the rhetores Latini. These
        teachers of public speaking, whose identity and innovations remain obscure to us, apparently
        as a matter of principle taught their subject in Latin, rigidly suppressing the Greek
        language; they prob- </p>

            Education from Cicero to Quintilian, Oxford 1926, pp. 58-69.</note> Our author can
        indeed in his examples praise or sympathize with the Gracchi, Saturninus, Drusus, and
        Sulpicius (2. xxviii. 45; 4. xxii. 31; 4. lv. 68; 4. xv. 22), and advise us to bring our
        adversaries into contempt by revealing their high birth (1. v. 8), but he can likewise
        accuse Gaius Gracchus of promoting panics (4. xxviii. 38), praise Caepio's attack on
        Saturninus as patriotic conduct (1. xii. 21; 2. xii. 17), warn Saturninus against the
        excesses of the popular mob (4. liv. 67), attribute the future revival of prosperity to the
        Conservatives (4. xxxiv. 45), and regard their slaughter as a disaster (4. viii. 12). The
        themes of the causae are variously Popular and Conservative in spirit, and we must infer
        that our author took his material where he found it and used it to suit his primary
        purpose—technical instruction in the art of rhetoric. If he really belonged to the Popular
        party, then he still must have believed in giving the Conservative cause a hearing. Nor
        again should our author's attitude to the Greeks be represented as an antagonism approaching
        hatred. True, he deliberately takes most of his historical exempla from Roman history,
        repeatedly finds fault with the methods of Greek rhetoricians (L i. 1; 3. xxiii. 38; 4. i.
        1), and suppresses the names of Greek writers whose examples he uses in Book 4. But he also
        omits the names of Roman authors whose examples he uses in that Book. Furthermore, he
        professes to know Greek books, occasionally uses Greek technical terms and other </p>

    <pb n="xxv"/>
    <p> Greek words, and praises the Greeks for their invention of the art of rhetoric (4. vii. 10).
        A few traces of Epicureanism in the work have given rise to the notion that our author was
        an adherent of that school of philosophy. A maxim of Epicurus, in altered form, is quoted
        without attribution (4. xvii. 24); in another example, religion and the fear of death are
        listed among the motives that impel men to crime (2. xxi. 34); and the dialecticians are
        censured for their love of ambiguities (2. xi. 16). But, as the notes in the present volume
        illustrate, the examples are drawn from the literature of various philosophical schools—a
        condition one would expect, inasmuch as manuals of rhetoric reflecting diverse schools were
        then extant, and these manuals may well have had much material in common. But the most
        vexing problem—and, as Norden <note type="footnote" n="a">a Gercke-Norden, Einleitung in die
            Altertumswissenschaft, Leipzig-Berlin, 1910, 1. 471.</note> says, one of the most
        interesting in the history of Roman literature—concerns the relations between our treatise
        and De Inventione.<note type="footnote" n="b">b Relevant passages of De Inventione have been
            indicated in the notes.</note> We are not even sure of the respective dates of
        composition. The reference in De Oratore 1. 2. 5 to the “essays . . . which slipped out of
        the notebooks of my boyhood, or rather of my youth” <note type="footnote" n="c">c Cf.
            Quintilian, 3. 6. 59 and 3. 1. 20.</note> does not enable us to fix upon a particular
        year for the composition of De Invention, but internal evidence points to c. 91 B.C. By this
        we mean only that the work contains no reference to any event that took place during or
        after the Marsic War.<note type="footnote" n="d">d See Marx, Proleg., pp. 76 ff.</note>
        Cicero may, of course, have </p>

    <pb n="xxvi"/>
    <p> worked the material into its final form later. When he published the book remains uncertain;
        allowing even for the possibility that in the passage above Cicero understated his years
        with ironic intent, we may not suppose a date much after 86 B.C. Likewise on internal
        evidence we assign our treatise to c. 86-82 B.C. The reference in 1. xv. 25 to the death of
        Sulpicius, which took place in the year 88, supplies us with a terminus post quern for the
        composition of Book 1.<note type="footnote" n="a">a In 3. i. 1 it is implied that separate
            books were sent to Herennius.</note> 4. liv. 68 contains a reference to Marius' seventh
        consulship, which he held in the year 86. And since nothing in the work mirrors the
        conditions which obtained in the state under Sulla—for instance, the first illustration in
        4. xxxv. 47 reflects a jury system still comprising both senators and equites— we may set
        the year 82 as the terminus ante quern. But again these dates regard only the contents; our
        author could have collected his examples by the year 82 and have composed the treatise
        later—not much later, probably, for he is eager to complete the work and send it to
        Herennius. It seems then likely, though not certain, that De Inventione was composed before
        our treatise. Agreements are so frequent that obviously there is a close tie between the two
        works. Some precepts are set forth in virtually the same language, and some of the
        illustrations are identical. This is not the place to enumerate these likenesses, nor the
            differences,<note type="footnote" n="b">b See Marx, Proleg., pp. 129 ff. Our author
            differs from Cicero in the method of presenting his material, in organization, and in
            spirit; for example, in many technical terms; in the doctrine of Proof, of the Types of

            emphasis upon the judicial kind of discourse as against Cicero's full treatment of all
            three kinds; in his much briefer discussion of many topics; in his less accurate
            quotations; in the more limited scope of his historical references (Cicero uses events
            in Roman history that antedate Hannibal); in his thoroughly Latin spirit—Marx' analogy
            is telling: our author is to the togata as Cicero, who is much more learned in Greek
            literature, is to the palliata.</note> which are even more striking; the treatises </p>

        Inventione. On the other hand, the belief that Cicero used the Rhetorica ad Herennium still
        finds adherents; but since it is probable that Cicero's work antedates our treatise, we
        hesitate to accept this notion. Other critics postulate a common source. That both authors
        had a single Greek original in common is not acceptable, for it would be unbelievable that
        two independent translators should have rendered their text in precisely the same words;
        furthermore, the illustrations from Roman writers shared by both make such a solution
            impossible.<note type="footnote" n="b">b See William Ramsay in Smith's Did. of Greek and
            Roman Biography and Mythology (London, 1880), 1. 727.</note> Or did both make direct use
        of the same Latin source? This view is popular, and takes two forms: (1) that both had the
        same Latin teacher, the differences being explained by the assumption that they heard this
        teacher at different times—our author later, and when the teacher had changed his mind on a
        number of points; and that Cicero used </p>

        our author only this manual, and without many changes—except for certain transpositions and
        abridgements, some omission of examples, and slight additions (e.g., the Introductions and
        Conclusions)—and Cicero with greater alterations; and that Cicero further used
            Hermagoras.<note type="footnote" n="c">c Whether directly or through an intermediate
            source; the point is debated.</note> Marx, on the other hand, finds that the contrast
        between the two works is too sharp to permit a theory either of direct dependence or of a
        single immediate common source, whether teacher or manual; he posits two Latin teachers, and
        behind these, two Rhodian masters who advocated opposing doctrines, our author inheriting
        the older theory and Cicero a fuller and more recent system. Without accepting Marx' thesis
        that the treatise is entirely a set of lecture notes—for I would assign more of the work to
        the author than Marx allows—I believe that something like his hypothesis is required. The
        differences between the two works seem to rule out a single immediate common source; the
        likenesses we may best refer to the use by both authors (or by their teachers) of Latin
        treatises like the De Ratione Dicendi of Antonius.<note type="footnote" n="d">d Most now
            believe that the influence of Antonius' book (cf. Cicero, Brutus 44. 163, De Oratore 1.
            21. 94, Quintilian, 3. 1. 19) is apparent in our treatise; see Kroehnert, pp. 23 ff.
            (but he thinks that Antonius was our author's Latin teacher), Marx, Proleg., p. 131, and
            Koehler, pp. 35-8, but also Weber, pp. 22 ff., and Thiele, Quaest, p. 94. Antonius' book
            appeared sometime before 91 B.C.</note> We cannot appraise the </p>

    <pb n="xxix"/>
    <p> influence of these older Latin arts of rhetoric which are lost to us, but it may well have
        been considerable. Our main difficulty when we compare the two works is in explaining the
        following coincidence. In 1. vi. 9 our author distinguishes three occasions (tempora) for
        the use of the Subtle Approach, and in 1. ix. 16 maintains that this is his own innovation;
        in De Invention 1. xvii. 23, however, a like threefold classification occurs, but instead of
        occasions we have “motives” (causae). Again diverse explanations are offered, but in the end
        we are, I believe, forced either to accept Marx' view that the classification is of Greek
        origin or to take the author's words at their face value. Marx finds the context here
        thoroughly Greek, even though we do not know any specific Greek source for the threefold
        classification, and hurls the charge of fraud and impudence at our author; the principle, he
        is sure, originated with the Rhodian rhetor whose doctrines our author followed, and Cicero
        in his turn received it from his own teacher in a modified form. Some of those who, like
        Marx, consider our treatise merely lecture notes, and yet wish to absolve the writer of the
        charge of fraud, make the point that he may not have known that his teacher had borrowed the
        precept from a Greek source; but the notion that the author did not know Greek well enough
        for his purposes would require proof. Schanz and others believe that Cicero borrowed the
        principle from our treatise, but that hypothesis would be more acceptable if we could be
        certain that the Rhetorica ad Herennium was actually published and available to Cicero
        before his publication of De Inventione. As a matter of fact, the precept appears in a
        somewhat different setting in De </p>

    <pb n="xxx"/>
    <p> Inventione, where its use is confined to the admirabile kind of cause. Our author doubtless
        depends on a Greek source for his general treatment of the doctrine of the Subtle Approach.
        Yet he always writes with practical motives, and on this particular point specifically says
        that his purpose is to provide a sure and lucid theory. When, therefore, he claims as an
        innovation the slight distinction between tempora and causae, we find him guilty, not of
        fraud, but of the exaggerated self-esteem which is also elsewhere characteristic of
            him.<note type="footnote" n="a">a He has not been moved to write by hope of gain or
            glory, “as others have been” (1. i. 1); “no one else” has written with sufficient care
            on Delivery (3. xi. 19); he "alone, in contrast with all other writers," has
            distinguished three occasions for the use of the Subtle Approach (1. ix. 16); cf. also
            1. vi. 10, 3. vii. 14, 3. xxiv. 40, and 4. lvi. 69.</note> The chief basis of Marx'
        charge of deceit is provided by the Introduction to Book 4, considered in relation to the
        examples used in that Book. This Proem, organized and developed like a chria<note
            type="footnote" n="b">b See the figure, Refining, 4. xlii. 54 ff.</note> according to
        the rules of the classroom, is rather graceful and learned; in language, too, it is smoother
        than the purely technical parts of the treatise; and its contents are Greek in character.
        Marx and others contend that it did not belong in this place originally, but was in its main
        outlines taken from a Greek source, inserted here, and made over to seem a Latin product. In
        this Preface our author presents a long argument against a theory, which he labels as Greek,
        of using borrowed examples, and promises to give only those of his own creation (except in
        the case of faulty ones). But the execution does not fulfil the promise, for he then
        proceeds actually to use borrowed </p>

    <pb n="xxxi"/>
    <p> examples, and without naming his sources, many of which are Greek. The author (or rather his
        teacher) thus got into trouble when, having used a Greek art which employed borrowed
        examples, he tried to adjust to it the contrary precepts of another Greek author who created
        his own examples. This is the person, say his critics, who in 1. i. 1 accuses Greek writers
        of futile self-assertion. According to another interpretation, which is intended to save the
        honour of both student and teacher, the young student here put down the notes of a lecture
        once delivered by his teacher, thinking this to be an appropriate place, but being no master
        of Greek, he was unaware that his teacher had in the rest of what comprises his Book 4 taken
        so many examples from Greek sources. It seems best, however, to grant the author some degree
        of literary individuality, and to regard his claim to the use of his " own " examples as at
        least an honest one. The notion that he did not know-Greek well enough for his purpose is
        gratuitous. To be sure, one cannot deny the contradiction between promise and fulfilment,
        nor assign to the author more than a relatively small share in the fashioning of the Proem,
        the Greek origin of which is obvious. But he made good use of this Proem, which as it stands
        coheres well enough with the text that follows it; he would naturally use material that he
        had heard or read, perhaps not always knowing where he had picked it up;<note

    <pb n="xxxii"/>
    <p> considered his free translation of the Greek examples and alteration of the Latin a large
        enough task to justify his feeling that they were now his own. He is sometimes adroit in
        transposing the original examples and adjusting them to Roman conditions.<note
            type="footnote" n="a">a See, e.g., in 4. xxix. 40, how the example of the figure
            Indecision from Demosthenes, De Corona 20, receives a Roman character.</note> The claim
        to originality becomes then a pardonable, or at least an understandable, exaggeration,
        rather than evidence of misrepresentation. Since the treatise stands near the beginnings of
        Latin prose,<note type="footnote" n="b">b Of extant complete prose works only Cato's De Agri
            Cultura is older.</note> its style has been the subject of close study. The faults have
        received special attention, especially those resulting from the author's quest for variety
        and for refinements in forms and constructions —for example, abundantia, artificially
        balanced clauses, the love of synonyms, of word-play, hyperbata, and asyndeta, the inflated
        language of the Conclusions to each Book, and other extravagances of rhetorical style; also
        the awkward transitions and the author's tendency merely to reiterate, under the guise of
        remarks concluding the treatment of a precept, what he has already said. Further
        peculiarities are the arbitrary use of pronouns, the omission of subjects of verbs in the
        infinitive, the mixture of present and future in the sequence of tenses, the frequent
        employment of the first person future active indicative, of substantives in -io, of the ut .
        . . ne . . . construction, and of the indicative in indirect questions. The dry style of the
        precepts usually contrasts with the lively and smooth style of the </p>

    <pb n="xxxiii"/>
    <p> examples. Although the style is in general not highly developed nor fluent, and there are
        several passages of which the meaning is obscure, our author in greatest part achieves, as I
        have said, his aim of clarity. It would not be fair to class his treatise with the crude
        textbooks (libri agrestes) disparaged in De Oratore 2. 3. 10. The language is up to a point
        " plebeian " and there are puerilities, but some of the qualities thus designated are rather
        to be assigned to what we may call the schoolmaster's manner and to the nature of technical,
        textbook style. Some of the irregularities perhaps also derive from the author's desire to
        make haste and to be brief, and from the process of translation; here and there the language
        betrays a Greek origin. Our author is fond of periods formed with rhythmic clausulae. It is
        another echo of the school practice of his time that the dichoree, favourite of Asianic
        style, plays the chief role,<note type="footnote" n="a">a See notes on 4. viii. 12, 4. xix.
            26, and 4. xxxii. 44.</note> but other cadences are also frequent. In the examples
        illustrating the three types of style in Book 4, rhythms are chosen with a fair degree of
        taste so as to correspond to the character of the different types. We may say that the style
        is within limits archaic, and sometimes reminiscent of Roman comedy; vet today it is no
        longer set in such sharp contrast as formerly to Ciceronian style. Kroll<note
            type="footnote" n="b">b Glotta, 22 (1934). 24 ff.</note> looks upon it as having been
        formed on the same principles as those of the Roman orators whom Cicero regarded as his own
        forerunners. In the present century it has been customary to undervalue the treatise because
        of its shortcomings— </p>

    <pb n="xxxiv"/>
    <p> which in large part are those inherent in the nature of a textbook—even as its virtues were
        often exaggerated in the nineteenth century, when more than one critic (e.g., Chaignet) held
        the work up as superior to Quintilian's Training of an Orator. Regarded from a historical
        point of view, the treatise presents no strikingly novel system; for us, however, it has
        literary importance because it is our only complete representative of the system it teaches.
        We may further readily admit that the work lacks the larger philosophical insight of
        Aristotle's Rhetoric, but that is not to deny its excellence as a practical treatise of the
        kind doubtless used by Roman orators. It is, moreover, itself not without usefulness for the
        modern student of the art. We ought now to redress the balance, to recognize that, though
        Greek in origin and inspiration, it marks a significant stage in Roman rhetorical theory, to
        assign due value especially to Book 4, and to bear in mind that the work exerted a
        beneficent influence for hundreds of years. One of the distinguished modern students of
        rhetoric, Spengel, called it " a book more precious than gold." LATER HISTORY Interpreting a
        subscription in MS. H, Marx assumed that the book first came to light in Africa in the
        middle of the fourth century and was soon thereafter brought to Lombardy.<note
            type="footnote" n="a">a See Proleg., pp. 1 ff. Not all believe that the work could have
            lain so long in oblivion; some think that it was used by Cornificius (see p. xiv, note

            Geschichte der Rhetorik, Paderborn 1927, p. 156 (48. 15).</note> (late fifth century),
        and Priscian (early sixth century). MSS. of the M class were known to Servatus Lupus, as we
        learn from a letter he wrote in 829 or 830, and indeed our oldest extant MSS., which belong
        to that class, date from the ninth and tenth centuries. Later the treatise was much used,
        abstracted, annotated, and interpolated; it shared favour with Cicero's De Inventione,
        which, as against modern taste, seems to have been preferred to his De Oratore. The great
        number of MSS. of the Ad Herennium—we have more than a hundred—is in itself an index of its
        popularity. Complete commentaries began to appear as early, perhaps, as the twelfth century,
        translations as early as the thirteenth. The full story, however, of the influence which the
        treatise enjoyed in education and in the poetry and prose of the Middle Ages and Renaissance
        has yet to be worked out. TRANSLATIONS The MSS. containing mediaeval translations of the
        treatise have not yet been adequately studied; several versions in Western vernaculars
        doubtless remain to be brought to light. We may, however, mention the compendium in Italian
        that is associated with the names of both Guidotto da Bologna and Bono Giamboni (Fiore di
        rettorica or Rettorica nuoua di Tullio), which in its original form was composed before
        1260, and the French rendering (of both our treatise and Cicero's De Inventione) made by
        Jean d'Antioche de Harens in 1282. Enrique de Villena translated the work into Castilian in
        1427. And the Greek version </p>

    <pb n="xxxvi"/>
    <p> of the section on Memory in Book 3 (reprinted in Marx, ed. maior, pp. 54-59) has been
        assigned, without strong evidence in either case, to Maximus Planudes (early saec. 14) or
        Theodore Gaza (saec. 15). The following translations belong to modern times: French: Paul
        Jacob, Paris 1652, 1670 (Les Oeuvres de Cicéron, tr. by Pierre du Ryer et al., vol. 1). J.

        Paris 1826 (in Bibliothèque Latine-Francaise, ed. C. L Panckoucke, vol. 1), and later eds.

        translator knows, the treatise has not hitherto been completely translated into English; a

    <p> EDITIONS The editio princeps was issued in Venice in 1170 by Nicolaus Jenson, under the
        editorship of Omnibonus Leonicenus. At least twenty-eight other editions appeared in the
        fifteenth century, several with commentaries. For the long list of editions that followed
        until the year 1834 the reader may be referred to J. C. Orelli's Onomasticon Tullianum in
        the Orelli-Baiter edition of Cicero's Works (Zurich 1836), vol. 6, pp. 197, 215, 218, and
        223. Of the nineteenth-century editions that appeared thereafter, we must list C. L.
        Kayser's separate edition, Leipzig (Teubner) 1854, and his Tauchnitz edition (among Cicero's
        Works), Leipzig 1860; G. F. Friedrich's edition, Leipzig (Teubner) 1884; and especially the
        excellent editio maior by Friedrich Marx, Leipzig (Teubner) 1894. This last, together with
        Marx' editio minor, Leipzig (Teubner) 1923, forms the basis of the text used by the present
        translator, who acknowledges also the profit derived from the critical notes in both
        editions and from the Prolegomena and Index in the editio maior—a debt which will be obvious
        in many places. Marx' work represents a great advance in the study of our treatise, and on
        it all students, even when they reject his conclusions on certain points, now base their
        investigations. THE TEXT The text depends on two groups of MSS.—an older group, M(utili),
        whose archetype contained lacunae and corruptions, and a younger, E(xpleti). The lacunae in
        M are filled out in E in part from another </p>

        emendations. In a number of places the text cannot be restored with certainty. At times the
        readings of M, especially when the text is corrupt and cannot otherwise be filled out, must
        give way to those of E. Neither M nor E can be followed alone throughout, and often the
        decision between the two is hard to make. As Marx says, each reading must be examined in
        accordance with the editor's conception of the author's habits of writing. To be sure E,
        which contains many conjectures made in the Middle Ages, must be used with caution, but even
        Marx, an editor of praiseworthy conservatism, adopts many of its readings. I have found it
        advisable to follow M in a number of cases where Marx followed E, but most of my changes
        from Marx have favoured E. The text in the present edition rests on that of Marx, editio
        minor; an apparatus is supplied only for those places where I deviate from the text of that
        edition. In the apparatus Mx stands for Marx, ed. minor, 1923; Mx ed. mai. for his edition
        of 1894. Marx constructed his text on the basis of the following MSS.: </p>

        The spelling in the present text differs in a number of places from that of Marx' editions.
        As some critics have charged, Marx at times went out of his way to set up archaic or unusual
        spellings (some of which he formed from corruptelae). My changes— not as a rule noted in the
        apparatus—have, I believe, sound support in the MSS.; and in several instances —which are
        noted—I have felt that the MSS. should not be allowed to determine forms regarded as
        incorrect. A completely uniform orthography, for example in the assimilation of
        prepositions, has not been sought. </p>

        ANALYSIS
        BOOK I
        (1) In a short Preface the author dedicates the treatise to Herennius, disclaims the intention of treating material irrelevant to the art of rhetoric, and stresses the need to apply in practice the rules he will set forth. (2) The task of the public speaker is to discuss capably those matters which law and custom have fixed for the uses of citizenship, and to secure as far as possible the agreement of his hearers. The kinds of causes are three: (a) Epideictic, (b) Deliberative, and (c) Judicial. (3) The speaker should be competent in (a) Invention, (b) Arrangement,
        (c) Style, (d) Memory, and (e) Delivery, and the means of acquiring these kinds of competence are three: (a) Theory, (b) Imitation, and (c) Practice. (4) In showing how to adapt the discourse to the theory of the speaker's function, the author gives primary consideration to Invention as used in each of the parts of a discourse in a Judicial cause: (a) Introduction, (b) Statement of Facts, (c) Division,
        (d) Proof, (e) Refutation, and (f) Conclusion. Each part of the discourse is defined before receiving special treatment in detail.
        (5) To make an appropriate Introduction we must consider whether the cause is (a) honourable, (b) discreditable, (c) of doubtful creditableness, or (d) petty. (b) The nature of the cause thus viewed from a moral standpoint determines whether the Introduction shall take the form of (a) a Direct Opening, or
        </p>

<pb n="xlvi"/>
<p>
        
        (b) a Subtle Approach. (7) Since the aim of the Introduction is to make the hearer (a) attentive, (b) receptive, and (c) well-disposed, the means whereby these states can be brought about is next discussed, (8) extended consideration being given to the four methods of making the hearer well-disposed: by discussing (a) our own person, (b) our adversaries, (c) our hearers, and (d) the facts themselves. (9) The Subtle Approach is reserved for three occasions: (a) when the cause is discreditable, (b) when the hearer has been won over, or (c) wearied, by the previous speakers of the opposition; and (9-10) the topics to be used in each of these situations are subjoined. (11) The Subtle Approach differs from the Direct Opening in achieving its results less obviously. Various kinds of Faulty Introductions are next listed.
        (12-13) There are three kinds of Statement of Facts: (a) narrative directed towards victory in causes in which a decision is to be rendered; (b) Incidental Narrative, introduced to gain credit, incriminate the opponent, or the like; (c) narrative used in practice exercises, whether based on (a) the exposition of facts, which presents three forms: (a) legendary narrative, (β) historical, and (γ) realistic, or based on (b) persons, which emphasizes diverse traits of character and reversal of fortune. (14) The Statement of Facts in an actual cause should have three qualities: (a) brevity, (b) clarity, and (c) plausibility; (14-16) how these may be achieved is next explained.
        (17) The Division sets forth what points we and our opponents agree upon, and what points remain contested, and then makes use of the Distribution, subheads under which are (a) the Enumeration, and (b) the Exposition, of the points we intend to discuss.

<p>
        
        (18-25) We next pass to Proof and Refutation, the most important divisions of the discourse. In order to develop these we must know the Types of Issue presented by the cause. These types are three, and can be charted as follows:
        <!-- <figure>*</figure> --> 
        </p>

<pb n="xlviii"/>
<p>
        
        (26) Before explaining how causes representing these Types of Issue should be developed, our author discusses the Justifying Motive of the defence, and the Central Point of the accusation, from the meeting of which in juridical and legal causes arises the Point to Adjudicate; (27) in a conjectural cause the Point to Adjudicate is established rather from the meeting of the Accusation and the Denial.
        
        BOOK II
        (1) Like Book I, this Book will be devoted to the most difficult kind of cause, the Judicial, and to the most important and difficult of the speaker's tasks. Invention. (2) Three subjects now demand attention: under Proof and Refutation, (a) how to apply the means of invention to each Type or Subtype of Issue, and (b) what sort of epicheiremes to seek or avoid; (c) under the divisions of the discourse, the Conclusion. The most important and difficult of the Types of Issue, the Conjectural, will be studied first. (3-12) After the contents appropriate to the Statement of Facts of both prosecutor and defendant's counsel have been set forth, the scheme of the Conjectural Issue is shown to include six divisions, which can be charted as follows:

                                        <figure>*</figure> -->
        Under the above rubrics the topics to be used by both prosecutor and defendant's counsel are indicated.
        (13-18) We now turn to the procedure to be followed in the various types of Legal Issue, rules for both sides being supplied to meet the situation in which (a) the intention of the framer appears to be at variance with the letter of the text (13-14); (b) two statutes conflict (15); (c) a text is regarded as ambiguous (16); (d) we must define a legal offence in order to decide whether an admitted act comes within the definition (17); (e) the procedural principle
        </p>

<pb n="l"/>
<p>
        of Transference is involved (18); or it is argued, by analogy with other laws, that (f) a matter not provided for by any special law comes within the spirit of other existing laws (18).
        (19-20) The Juridical Issue: In developing an Absolute Juridical cause, we must first know whether the act was in accord with the Law, which derives from six sources: (a) The Law of Nature, (b) Statute Law, (c) Legal Custom, (d) Previous Judgements, (e) Equity, (f) Agreement; each is defined and illustrated. (21-22) The development of the Subtypes of an Assumptive Juridical cause is discussed in the following order: (a) Comparison with the Alternative to show that the admitted act was less evil; (b) Shifting of the Question of Guilt (22); (c) Acknowledgement of the Charge (23-25); and (d) Rejection of the Responsibility (26).
        (27) Having shown what arguments to use in a judicial cause, the author now studies the artistic Development of an argument. The five parts of a complete argument are (28-30) defined and illustrated: (a) the Proposition, (b) the Reason, (c) the Proof of the Reason, (d) the Embellishment, (e) the Resume, provision being made for situations in which not all the five parts are to be used. (31) He next investigates defective arguments, illustrating (32-46) faults for each of the parts, and treating (46), under Embellishment, (a) similes, (β) examples, (γ) amplifications, and (δ) previous judgements.
        (47) The Conclusion of a speech is tripartite, including: (a) the Summing Up; (b) the Amplification, which draws commonplaces from ten formulae, and (c) the Appeal to Pity.

        BOOK III
        (1) will deal with Deliberative and Epideictic causes, and, of the departments of rhetoric, with Arrangement, Delivery, and Memory.
        (2) A Deliberative speech concerns a choice among two or more courses of action; the question may be examined either on its own account or on account of a motive extraneous to the question itself. (3) The aim in a deliberative speech is Advantage, to be studied in accordance with the following topics:
        
        <!-- <figure>*</figure> -->
        
        The use of the topics (4-6) under the Right, and (7) under the Praiseworthy is explained in some detail.
        (7) We now learn how to develop the deliberative cause as a whole, beginning with the Introduction and Statement of facts, and proceeding (8) to the Division, (8-9) the Proof and Refutation, and Conclusion.
        </p>

<pb n="lii"/>
<p>
        
        (10) Epideictic, including praise and censure, deals with
        1. External Circumstances
        (a) Descent
        (b) Education
        (c) Wealth
        (d) Kinds of power
        (e) Titles to fame
        (f) Citizenship
        (g) Friendships
        2. Physical Attributes
        (a) Agility
        (b) Strength
        (c) Beauty
        (d) Health
        3. Qualities of Character
        (a) Wisdom
        (b) Justice
        (c) Courage
        (d) Temperance
        (11) As for the Development of an epideictic discourse, the Introduction is drawn from (a) our own person, (b) the person we are discussing, (c) the person of our hearers, or (d) the subject-matter itself. (11-13) The topics for the Introduction are indicated, as also for (13) the Statement of facts, the Division, (13-15) the Proof and Refutation, and (15) the Conclusion. Epideictic, though seldom employed by itself independently in actual life, is yet worth our careful attention.
        (16) Having finished with Invention, we turn to Arrangement, which is of two kinds: (a) that arising from the principles of rhetoric: (a) for the whole speech, (β) for individual arguments; and (b) that accommodated to particular circumstances (17).
        (18) An appropriate Arrangement in Proof and Refutation would be to place: (a) the strongest arguments at the beginning and the end of the pleading, (b) arguments of medium force, and weak arguments, in the middle.
        (19-20) Delivery, a faculty especially useful to the speaker, presents the following scheme:
        </p>

<pb n="liii"/>
<p>
        
        <!--     <figure>*</figure> -->
        
        (24-25) Rules for the use of the voice in situations representing each of these eight subdivisions are offered, and (26-27) rules for bodily movement appropriate to each.
        (28-29) The two kinds of Memory, natural and artificial, should supplement each other. The artificial memory includes backgrounds and images. (30-32) To memorize a large number of items, we must have a large number of backgrounds, in a regular series, in a deserted region, clearly distinguishable, of moderate size and brightness, and at intervals of about thirty feet. (33) Images should be of both subject-matter and words; (33-34) the author illustrates both kinds. (35-37) To acquire images strong enough to awaken recollection we must establish striking likenesses; and then in order to revive the images, often and rapidly rehearse the original backgrounds. (38-39) The author objects for a number of reasons to listing images that correspond to a great many words, yet (39-40) regards the memorization of words as helpful in
        </p>

<pb n="liv"/>
<p>
        
        strengthening the ability to memorize subject-matter, which is of practical use. (40) Essential in developing the memory is constant exercise.
        
        BOOK IV
        In a Preface (1-10) the author justifies the method he will follow of using his own examples in illustration of the Principles of Style. The Greek writers whom he opposes believe in drawing examples from the orators and poets, on the following grounds: (a) It would be immodest to create one's own examples.
        (b) Since examples serve the purpose of testimony, they should, like testimony, be drawn from writers of highest esteem. The prestige of the ancients excites the ambition to imitate their excellence.
        (c) It is proof of technical skill to select appropriate examples and to list these under the proper rubrics.
        The author will refute these arguments as follows: (a) The argument on modesty is childish—why does not modesty keep these writers from writing anything at all? They are open rather to the charge of impudence, for extracting from the labour of authors praise for themselves, (b) Examples do not confirm or bear witness, but merely clarify the nature ^of a statement. Further, testimony must accord with the proposition, but the performance of these rhetoricians does not accord with their proposal. In writing a treatise they propose to teach to others what they have invented, but really show us what others have invented, (c) The choice from among many examples is not difficult, even for those who lack the highest art; the facile chooser will not necessarily write with skill himself.

        Furthermore, these writers are not only at fault in borrowing examples, but make an even greater mistake in borrowing from a great number of sources. If they must borrow examples at all, the selection should be made from one author alone, for (a) they might choose whom they would to supply examples for all cases, one on whose authority they could rely; (b) if a student believes that all qualities can exist in one man, he will be encouraged to strive for a mastery of them all.
        Finally, the author will show that examples should not be borrowed at all: (a) an example cited by a writer on an art should be proof of his own skill in that art; (b) an example of one's own creation, draughted expressly to conform to the principle it is intended to clarify, makes for better understanding on the student's part.
        The study of Style will consider (a) the kinds to which faultless oratorical style will confine itself, and (b) the qualities style should always have.
        (11-14) The kinds of Style are three: (a) Grand. (b) Middle, and (c) Simple. Each is described and then illustrated by a passage. (15-16) Adjoining each of these style is a defective style: (a) adjoining the Grand is the Swollen; (β) adjoining the Middle is the Slack or Drifting; (γ) adjoining the Simple is the Meagre. Again each is described and then illustrated by a passage.
        Qualities of appropriate and finished Style:
        
        (a) Taste (17)
        (α) Correct Latinity,
        avoiding
        Solecisms
        Barbarisms
        
        (β) Clarity, achieved

        ipsum quod datur otii libentius in philosophia consumere consuevimus, tamen tua nos, Gai
        Herenni, voluntas commovit ut de ratione dicendi conscriberemus, ne aut tua causa noluisse
        aut fugisse nos laborem putares. Et eo studiosius hoc negotium suscepimus, quod te non sine
        causa velle cognoscere rhetoricam intellegebamus; non enim in se parum fructus habet copia
        dicendi et commoditas orationis, si recta intellegentia et definita animi moderatione
        gubernetur. Quas ob res illa quae Graeci scriptores inanis adrogantiae causa sibi
        adsumpserunt reliquimus. Nam illi, ne parum multa scisse viderentur, ea conquisierunt quae
        nihil adtinebant, ut ars difficilior cognitu putaretur; nos autem ea quae videbantur ad</p>

    <pb n="4"/>
       <p>rationem dicendi pertinere sumpsimus. Non enim spe quaestus aut gloria commoti venimus ad
        scribendum quemadmodum ceteri, sed ut industria nostra tuae morem geramus voluntati. Nunc,
        ne nimium longa sumatur oratio, de re dicere incipiemus, si te unum illud monuerimus, artem
        sine adsiduitate dicendi non multum iuvare, ut intellegas hanc rationem praeceptionis ad

        iis rebus posse dicere quae res ad usum civilem moribus et legibus contitutae sunt, cum
        adsensione auditorum quoad eius fieri poterit. Tria genera sunt causarum quae recipere debet
        orator: demonstrativum, deliberativum, iudiciale. Demonstrativum est quod tribuitur in
        alicuius certae personae laudem vel vituperationem. Deliberativum est in consultationem quod
        habet in se suasionem et dissuasionem. Iudiciale est quod positum est in controversia, et
        quod habet accusationem aut petitionem cum defensione. Nunc quas res oratorem habere
        oporteat docebimus, deinde quo modo has causas tractari conveniat ostendemus.</p>

        elocutionem, memoriam, pronuntiationem. Inventio est excogitatio rerum verarurn aut veri

        demonstrat quid quibus locis sit conlocandum. Elocutio est idoneorum verborum et
        sententiarum ad inventionem adcommodatio. Memoria est firma animi rerum et verborum et
        dispositionis perceptio. Pronuntiatio est vocis, vultus, gestus moderatio cum venustate.
        Haec omnia tribus rebus adsequi poterimus: arte, imitatione, exercitatione. Ars est

        conveniat, nunc quemadmodum possit oratio ad rationem oratoris officii adcommodari dicendum
        videtur.</p><note type="margin" n="4">4</note><milestone unit="section" n="3"/><p>III. Inventio in sex partes orationis consumitur: in
        exordium, narrationem, divisionem, confirmationem, confutationem, conclusionem. Exordium est
        principium orationis, per quod animus auditoris constituitur ad audiendum. Narratio est
        rerum gestarum aut proinde ut gestarum expositio. Divisio est per quam aperimus quid
        conveniat, quid in controversia sit, et per quam exponimus quibus de rebus simus acturi.

        orationis partibus loqueremur et eas ad inventionis rationem adcommodaremus, de exordio
        primum dicendum videtur. <note type="margin" n="5">5</note> Causa posita, quo commodius exordiri

        defendendum videtur, aut oppugnabimus quod ab omnibus videtur oppugnari debere, ut pro viro
        forti, contra parricidam. Turpe genus intellegitur cum aut honesta res oppugnatur aut
        defenditur turpis. Dubium genus est cum habet in se causa et honestatis et turpitudinis
        partem. Humile genus est cum contempta res adfertur.</p>

        statim auditoris animum nobis idoneum reddimus ad audiendum. Id ita sumitur ut adtentos, ut
        dociles, ut benivolos auditores habere possimus. Si genus causae dubium habebimus, a
        benivolentia principium constituemus, ne quid illa turpitudinis pars nobis obesse possit.
        Sin humile genus erit causae, faciemus adtentos. Sin turpe causae genus erit, insinuatione
        utendum est, de qua posterius dicemus, nisi quid nacti erimus qua re adversarios criminando
        benivolentiam captare possimus. Sin honestum genus causae erit, licebit recte vel uti vel
        non uti principio. Si uti volemus, aut id oportebit ostendere qua re causa sit honesta, aut
        breviter quibus de rebus simus dicturi exponere. Sin principio uti nolemus, ab lege, ab

        quibus principio uti non possumus, quae diligenter sunt consideranda: aut cum turpem causam
        habemus, hoc est, cum ipsa res animum auditoris a nobis alienat; aut cum animus auditoris
        persuasus esse videtur ab iis qui ante contra dixerunt; aut cum defessus est eos audiendo
        qui ante dixerunt. Si causa turpitudinem habebit, exordiri poterimus his rationibus:

        factum ostendemus; aut aliquorum iudicium de simili causa aut de eadem aut de minore aut de
        maiore proferemus, deinde ad nostram causam pedetemptim accedemus et similitudinem
        conferemus. Item si negabimus nos de adversariis aut de aliqua re dicturos, et tamen occulte
        dicemus interiectione verborum. <note type="margin" n="10">10</note> Si persuasus auditor, si<app n="1"

        auditoribus—neque enim non facile scire poterimus, quoniam non sumus nescii quibus rebus
        fides fieri soleat—ergo si fidem factam putabimus, his nos rebus insinuabimus ad causam: de
        eo quod adversarii firmissimum sibi adiumentum putarint primum nos dicturos pollicebimur; ab
        adversarii dicto exordiemur, et ab eo maxime quod ille nuperrime dixerit; dubitatione utemur

        eiusmodi debet esse ut statim apertis rationibus quibus praescripsimus aut benivolum aut
        adtentum aut docilem faciamus auditorem; at insinuatio eiusmodi debet esse ut occulte, per
        dissimulationem, eadem illa omnia conficiamus, ut ad eandem commoditatem in dicendi opere

        hoc est, ut auditores sese perpetuo nobis adtentos, dociles, benivolos praebeant, tamen id
        per exordium causae maxime comparandum est. Nunc, ne quando vitioso exordio utamur, quae
        vitia vitanda sint docebo. Exordienda causa servandum est ut lenis sit sermo et usitata
        verborum consuetudo, ut non apparata videatur oratio esse. Vitiosum exordium est quod in

        narrationem transeamus. Narrationum tria sunt genera. Unum est cum exponimus rem gestam et
        unum quidque trahimus ad utilitatem nostram vincendi causa, quod pertinet ad eas causas de
        quibus iudicium futurum est. Alterum genus est narrationis, quod intercurrit nonnumquam aut
        fidei aut criminationis aut transitionis aut alicuius apparationis causa. Tertium genus est
        id quod a causa civili remotum est, in quo tamen exerceri convenit, quo commodius illas
        superiores narrationes in causis <note type="margin" n="13">13</note> tractare possimus. Eius
        narrationis duo sunt genera: unum quod in negotiis, alterum quod in personis positum est. Id
        quod in negotiorum expositione positum est tres habet partes: fabulam, historiam,
        argumentum. Fabula est quae neque veras neque veri similes continet res, ut eae sunt quae
        tragoedus traditae </p>

    <pb n="24"/>
    <p> sunt. Historia est gesta res, sed ab aetatis nostrae memoria remota. Argumentum est ficta
        res quae tamen fieri potuit, velut argumenta comoediarum. Illud genus narrationis quod in
        personis positum est debet habere sermonis festivitatem, animorum dissimilitudinem,
        gravitatem lenitatem, spem metum, suspicionem desiderium, dissimulationem misericordiam,
        rerum varietates, fortunae commutationem, insperatum incommodum, subitam laetitiam, iucundum
        exitum rerum. Verum haec in exercendo transigentur; illud quod ad veritatem pertinet quomodo
        tractari conveniat aperiemus. <note type="margin" n="14">14</note> <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>IX. Tres res convenit habere
        narrationem: ut brevis, ut dilucida, ut veri similis sit; quae quoniam fieri oportere
        scimus, quemadmodum faciamus cognoscendum est. Rem breviter narrare poterimus si inde
        incipiemus narrare unde necesse erit; et si non ab ultimo initio repetere volemus; et si
        summatim, non parti- </p>

    <pb n="26"/>
    <p> culatim narrabimus; et si non ad extremum, sed usque eo quo opus erit persequentur; et si
        transitionibus nullis utemur, et si non deerrabimus ab eo quod coeperimus exponere; et si
        exitus rerum ita ponemus ut ante quoque quae facta sint sciri<app n="1"><note>1 sciri P2BCE:
                scire HP1 M x.</note></app> possint, tametsi nos reticuerimus: quod genus, si dicam
        me ex provincia redisse, profectum quoque in provinciam intellegatur. Et omnino non modo id
        quod obest, sed etiam id quod neque obest neque adiuvat satius est praeterire. Et ne bis aut
        saepius idem dicamus cavendum est; etiam ne quid novissime quod diximus deinceps dicamus,
        hoc modo: Athenis Megaram vesperi advenit Simo; Ubi advenit Megaram, insidias fecit virgini;
        Insidias postquam fecit, vim in loco adtulit. <note type="margin" n="15">15</note> Rem dilucide
        narrabimus si ut quicquid primum gestum erit ita primum exponemus, et rerum ac temporum
        ordinem conservabimus ut gestae res erunt, aut ut potuisse geri videbuntur; hic erit
        considerandum ne quid perturbata, ne quid contorte, ne quid nove dicamus, ne quam in aliam
        rem transeamus, ne ab ultimo repetamus, ne longe persequamur, ne quid quod ad rem pertineat
        praetereamus; et si sequemur ea quae de brevitate praecepta sunt, nam quo brevior,
        dilucidior et cognitu facilior narratio fiet. </p>

    <pb n="28"/>
    <p>
        <note type="margin" n="16">16</note> Veri similis narratio erit si ut mos, ut opinio, ut natura postulat
        dicemus; si spatia temporum, personarum dignitates, consiliorum rationes, locorum
        opportunitates constabunt, ne refelli possit aut temporis parum fuisse, aut causam nullam,
        aut locum idoneum non fuisse, aut homines ipsos facere aut pati non potuisse. Si vera res
        erit, nihilominus haec omnia narrando conservanda sunt, nam saepe veritas, nisi haec servata
        sint, fidem non potest facere; sin erunt ficta, eo magis erunt conservanda. De iis rebus
        caute confingendum est quibus in rebus tabulae aut alicuius firma auctoritas videbitur
        interfuisse. Adhuc quae dicta sunt arbitror mihi constare cum ceteris artis scriptoribus,
        nisi quia de insinuationibus nova excogitavimus, quod eam soli nos praeter ceteros in tria
        tempora divisimus, ut plane certam viam et perspicuam rationem exordiorum haberemus. <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>X.
        Nunc, quod reliquum est—quoniam de rerum inventione disputandum est, in quo singulare
        consumitur oratoris artificium—dabimus operam ut nihilominus industrie quam rei utilitas

        Item e contrario: " Agamemnonem esse a Clytemestra occisum confitentur; cum id ita sit, me
        ulcisci parentem negant oportuisse." Deinde, cum hoc fecerimus, distributione uti debemus.
        Ea dividitur in duas partes: enumerationem et expositionem. Enumeratione utemur cum dicemus
        numero quot de rebus dicturi sumus. Eam plus quam trium partium numero esse non oportet; nam
        et periculosum est ne quando plus minusve dicamus, et suspicionem adfert auditori
        meditationis et artificii, quae res fidem abrogat orationi. Expositio est cum res quibus de

        Causarum constitutiones alii quattuor fecerunt; noster doctor tres putavit esse, non ut de
        illorum quicquam detraheret inventione, sed ut ostenderet id quod oportuisset simpliciter ac

    <pb n="34"/>
    <p> ante diximus, tres sunt: coniecturalis, legitima, iuridicalis. Coniecturalis est cum de
        facto controversia est, hoc modo: Aiax in silva, postquam resciit quae fecisset per
        insaniam, gladio incubuit. Ulixes intervenit, occisum conspicatur, corpore telum cruentum
        educit. Teucer intervenit, fratrem occisum, inimicum fratris cum gladio cruento videt.
        Capitis arcessit. Hic coniectura verum quaeritur. De facto erit controversia; ex eo
        constitutio causae coniecturalis nominatur. <note type="margin" n="19">19</note> Legitima est
        constitutio cum in scripto aut e scripto aliquid controversiae nascitur. Ea dividitur in
        partes sex: scriptum et sententiam, contrarias leges, ambiguum, definitionem. translationem,
        ratiocinationem. Ex scripto et sententia controversia nascitur cum videtur scriptoris
        voluntas cum scripto ipso dissentire, hoc modo: si lex sit quae iubeat eos qui propter
        tempestatem navem reliquerint omnia perdere, eorum navem ceteraque esse, si navis conservata
        sit, qui remanserunt in navi. Magnitudine tempestatis omnes perterriti navem reliquerunt, in

    <pb n="36"/>
    <p> conscenderunt—praeter unum aegrotum; is propter morbum exire et fugere non potuit. Casu et
        fortuitu navis in portum incolumis delata est; illam aegrotus possedit. Navem petit ille
        cuius fuerat. Haec constitutio legitima est ex scripto et sententia. <note type="margin" n="20"
            >20</note> Ex contrariis legibus controversia constat cum alia lex iubet aut permittit,
        alia vetat quippiam fieri, hoc modo: Lex vetat eum qui de pecuniis repetundis damnatus sit
        in contione orationem habere; altera lex iubet augurem in demortui locum qui petat in
        contione nominare. Augur quidam damnatus de pecuniis repetundis in demortui locum nominavit;
        petitur ab eo multa. Constitutio legitima ex contrariis legibus. <milestone unit="section" n="12"/>XII. Ex ambiguo
        controversia nascitur cum scriptum<app n="1"><note>1 scriptum BCE: res unam sententiam
                scripta scriptum HP1 Mx: res una sententia scripta scriptum II.</note></app> duas
        aut plures sententias significat, hoc modo: Paterfamilias cum filium heredem faceret,
        testamento vasa argentea uxori legavit: " Heres meus uxori meae xxx pondo vasorum
        argenteorum dato, quae <app n="2"><note>2 quae BCE Mx ed. mai.: qua HP II Mx.</note></app>

                (in marg.) II: conpelletur Mx.</note></app> Ea est huiusmodi: Cum Lucius Saturninus
        legem frumentariam de semissibus et trientibus laturus esset, Q. Caepio, qui per id temporis
        quaestor urbanus erat, docuit senatum aerarium pati non posse largitionem tantam. Senatus
        decrevit, si eam legem ad populum ferat, adversus rem publicam videri ea facere. Saturninus
        ferre coepit. Collegae intercedere, ille nihilominus sitellam detulit. Caepio, ut illum,
        contra intercedentibns collegis, adversus rem publicam vidit ferre, cum viris bonis impetum
        facit, pontes disturbat, cistas deicit, inpedimento est quo setius feratur. Arcessitur
        Caepio maiestatis. Constitutio legitima ex definitione. Vocabulum enim definitur ipsum cum
        quaeritur quid sit minuere maiestatem. <note type="margin" n="22">22</note> Ex translatione controversia

    <pb n="40"/>
    <p> tionis Graeci in iudiciis, nos in iure plerumque utimur. In iudiciis tamen nonnihil utimur,
        ut hoc modo: Si quis peculatus accusatur quod vasa argentea publica de loco privato dicatur
        sustulisse, possit dicere, cum definitione sit usus quid sit furtum, quid peculatus, secum
        furti agi, non peculatus oportere. Haec partitio legitimae constitutionis his de causis raro
        venit in iudicium, quod in privata actione praetoriae exceptiones sunt et causa cadit qui
        egit nisi habuit actionem, et in publicis quaestionibus cavetur legibus ut ante, si reo
        commodum sit, iudicium de accusatore fiat utrum illi liceat accusare necne. <note type="margin" n="23"
            >23</note> <milestone unit="section" n="13"/>XIII. Ex ratiocinatione controversia constat cum res sine propria lege venit
        in iudicium, quae tamen ab aliis legibus similitudine quadam aucupatur. Ea est huiusmodi:
        Lex: "Si furiosus existet, adgnatum gentiliumque in eo pecuniaque eius potestas esto." Et
        lex: " Qui parentem necasse iudicatus erit, ut is </p>

    <pb n="42"/>
    <p> obvolutus et obligatus corio devehatur in profluentem." Et lex: "Paterfamilias uti super
        familia pecuniave sua legaverit, ita ius esto." Et lex: " Si paterfamilias intestato
        moritur, familia pecuniaque eius adgnatum gentiliumque<app n="1"><note>1 gentiliumque d: et
                gentilium E: gentilium M Mx.</note></app> esto." Malleolus iudicatus est matrem
        necasse. Ei damnato statim folliculo lupino os obvolutum est et soleae ligneae in pedibus
        inductae sunt; in carcerem ductus est. Qui defendebant eum tabulas in carcerem adferunt,
        testamentum ipso praesente conscribunt, testes recte adfuerunt; de illo supplicium sumitur.
        Ii qui heredes erant testamento hereditatem adeunt. Frater minor Malleoli, qui eum
        oppugnaverat in eius periculo, suam vocat hereditatem lege adgnationis. Hic certa lex in rem
        nulla adfertur, et tamen multae adferuntur, ex quibus ratiocinatio nascitur quare potuerit
        aut non potuerit iure testamentum facere. Constitutio legitima ex ratiocinatione. Cuiusmodi
        partes essent legitimae constitutionis ostendimus; nunc de iuridicali constitutione dicamus.
            <note type="margin" n="24">24</note> <milestone unit="section" n="14"/>XIV. Iuridicalis constitutio est cum factum convenit, sed iure
        an iniuria factum sit quaeritur. Eius constitutionis partes duae sunt, quarum una absoluta,
        altera adsumptiva nominatur. </p>

    <pb n="44"/>
    <p> Absoluta est cum id ipsum quod factum est, ut aliud nihil foris adsumatur, recte factum esse
        dicemus, eiusmodi:<app n="1"><note>1 dicemus eiusmodi l Mx ed. mai.: eam dicemus eius modi
                M: dicemus ea ciusmodi (huiusmodi C) est BCd: dicemus ea est huiusmodi b: eam rem
                dicemus eiusmodi Mx.</note></app> Mimus quidam nominatim Accium poetam conpellavit
        in scaena. Cum eo Accius iniuriarum agit. Hic nihil aliud defendit nisi licere nominari eum
        cuius nomine scripta dentur agenda. Adsumptiva pars est cum per se defensio infirma est,
        adsumpta extraria re conprobatur. Adsumptivae partes sunt quattuor: concessio, remotio
        criminis, translatio criminis, conparatio. Concessio est cum reus postulat ignosci. Ea
        dividitur in purgationem et deprecationem. Purgatio est cum consulto negat se reus fecisse.
        Ea dividitur in inprudentiam, fortunam, necessitatem: fortunam, ut Caepio ad tribunos plebis
        de exercitus amissione; inprudentiam, ut ille qui de eo servo qui dominum occiderat
        supplicium sumpsit, cui frater esset, ante- </p>

    <pb n="46"/>
    <p> quam tabulas testamenti aperuit, cum is servus testamento manu missus esset; necessitudinem,
        ut ille qui ad diem commeatus non venit quod flumina vias interclusissent. Deprecatio est
        cum et peccasse se et consulto fecisse confitetur, et tamen postulat ut sui misereantur. Hoc
        in iudicio fere non potest usu venire, nisi quando pro eo dicimus cuius multa recte facta
        extant, hoc modo—in loco communi per amplificationem iniciemus: " Quodsi hoc fecisset, tamen
        ei pro pristinis beneficiis ignosci conveniret; verum nihil postulat ignosci." Ergo in
        iudicium non venit, at in senatum, ad imperatorem et in consilium talis causa potest venire.
            <note type="margin" n="25">25</note> <milestone unit="section" n="15"/>XV. Ex translatione criminis causa constat cum fecisse nos non
        negamus, sed aliorum peccatis coactos fecisse dicimus; ut Orestes cum se defendit in matrem
        conferens crimen. Ex remotione criminis causa constat cum a nobis non crimen, sed culpam
        ipsam amovemus, et vel in hominem transferimus vel in rem quampiam conferi-mus. In hominem
        transfertur, ut si accusetur is qui Publium Sulpicium se fateatur occidisse, et id iussu
        consulum defendat et eos dicat non modo imperasse, </p>

    <pb n="48"/>
    <p> sed rationem quoque ostendisse quare id facere liceret. In rem confertur, ut si quis ex
        testamento quod facere iussus sit ex plebis scito vetetur. Ex conparatione causa constat cum
        dicimus necesse fuisse alterutrum facere, et id quod fecerimus satius fuisse facere. Ea
        causa huiusmodi est: C. Popilius, cum a Gallis obsideretur neque fugere ullo modo posset,
        venit cum hostium ducibus in conlocutionem; ita discessit ut inpedimenta relinqueret,
        exercitum educeret. Satius esse duxit amittere inpedimenta quam exercitum. Exercitum eduxit,
        inpedimenta reliquit. Arcessitur maiestatis. <milestone unit="section" n="16"/>XVI. Quae constitutiones et quae constitutionum
        partes sint videor ostendisse. Nunc quo modo eas et qua via tractari conveniat demonstrandum
        est, si prius aperuerimus quid oporteat ab ambobus in causa destinari quo ratio omnis totius
        orationis conferatur. </p>

    <pb n="50"/>
    <p>
        <note type="margin" n="26">26</note> Constitutione igitur reperta statim quaerenda ratio est. Ratio est
        quae causam facit et continet defensionem, hoc modo—ut docendi causa in hac potissimum causa
        consistamus: Orestes confitetur se occidisse matrem; nisi adtulerit facti rationem,
        per-verterit defensionem. Ergo adfert eam, quae nisi intercederet, ne causa quidem esset. "
        Illa enim," inquit, " patrem meum occiderat." Ergo, ut ostendi, ratio ea est quae continet
        defensionem, sine qua ne parva quidem dubitatio potest remorari damnationem. Inventa ratione
        firmamentum quaerendum est, id est, quod continet accusationem, quod adfertur contra
        rationem defensionis de qua ante dictum est. Id constituetur hoc modo: Cum usus fuerit
        Orestes ratione hoc pacto: " Iure occidi, illa enim patrem meum occiderat," utetur accusator
        firmamento, hoc modo: " At non abs te occidi neque indamnatam poenas pendere oportuit." Ex
        ratione defensionis et ex firmamento accusationis iudicii quaestio nascatur oportet, quam
            <app n="1"><note>1 quam B C b l Mx ed. mai.: tam HP: eam Mx: quod d</note></app> nos </p>

    <pb n="52"/>
    <p> iudicationem, Graeci crinomenon appellant. Ea constituetur ex coniunctione firmamenti et
            rationis,<app n="1"><note>1 rationis defensione MSS. Mx.</note></app>hoc modo: Cum dicat
        Orestes se patris ulciscendi matrem occidisse, rectumne fuerit sine iudicio a filio
        Clytemestram occidi? Ergo hac ratione iudicationem reperire convenit; reperta iudicatione
        omnem rationem totius orationis eo conferri oportebit. <note type="margin" n="27">27</note> <milestone unit="section" n="17"/>XVII. In
        omnibus constitutionibus et partibus constitutionum hac via iudicationes reperientur,
        praeterquam in coniecturali constitutione; in ea nec ratio qua re fecerit quaeritur, fecisse
        enim negatur, nec firmamentum exquiritur, quoniam non subest ratio. Quare ex intentione et
        infitiatione iudicatio constituitur, hoc modo: Intentio: "Occidisti Aiacem;" Infitiatio:
        "Non occidi;" Iudicatio: " Occideritne? " Ratio omnis utriusque orationis, ut ante dictum
        est, ad hanc iudicationem conferenda est. Si plures erunt constitutiones aut partes
        constitutionum, iudicationes quoque plures erunt in una causa, sed et omnes simili ratione
        reperientur. Sedulo dedimus operam ut breviter et dilucide quibus de rebus adhuc dicendum
        fuit diceremus. Nunc quoniam satis huius voluminis magnitudo crevit, commodius est in altero

        officia qua ratione facillime consequi posset. Verum quod neque de omnibus rebus simul dici

        oporteret; quorum utrumque pertinet ad confirmationem et ad confutationem. Deinde ad
        extremum docuimus cuiusmodi conclusionibus orationum uti oporteat, qui locus erat extremus
        de sex partibus orationis. Primum ergo quaeremus quemadmodum quamque causam tractare

    <p> Huius constitutionis ratio in sex partes est distributa: probabile, conlationem, signum,

        quod probatur expedisse peccare, et ab simili turpitudine hominem numquam afuisse. Id
        dividitur in causam et in vitam. Causa est ea quae induxit ad maleficium commodorum spe aut
        incommodorum vitatione, cum quaeritur num quod commodum maleficio appetierit, num honorem,
        num pecuniam, num dominationem; num aliquam cupiditatem aut amoris aut eiusmodi libidinis
        voluerit explere, aut num quod incommodum vitarit: inimicitias, infamiam, dolorem,
        supplicium. <note type="margin" n="4">4</note> <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>III. Hic accusator in spe commodi cupiditatem ostendet
        adversarii, in vitatione incommodi formidinem augebit. Defensor autem negabit fuisse causam
        si poterit, aut eam vehementer extenuabit; deinde iniquum esse dicet omnes ad quos aliquid

        accusator num quando simile quid fecerit. Si id non reperiet, quaeret num quando venerit in

        ante exposuerit vita hominis possit adcommodari, hoc modo: si dicet pecuniae causa fecisse,

        causa peccati conglutinare. Si non poterit par vitium eum causa reperire, reperiat dispar.
        Si non poterit avarum demonstrare, demonstret corruptorem perfidiosum, si quo modo poterit

        famam spectari oportere: illum ante occultasse sua flagitia; se planum facturum ab eo
        maleficium non abesse. Defensor primum demonstrabit vitam integram, si poterit; id si non
        poterit, confugiet ad inprudentiam, stultitiam, adulescentiam, vim, persuasionem; quibus de
        rebus . . . vituperatio eorum quae extra id crimen erunt non debeat adsignari. Sin

        dicat de innocente, et utetur loco communi rumoribus credi non oportere. Sin nihil eorum
        fieri potest, utatur extrema defensione: dicat non se de moribus eius apud censores, sed de
        criminibus adversariorum apud iudices dicere. <note type="margin" n="6">6</note> <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>IV. Conlatio est cum
        accusator id quod adversarium fecisse criminatur alii nemini nisi reo bono fuisse
        demonstrat, aut alium neminem potuisse perficere nisi adversarium, aut eum ipsum aliis
        rationibus aut non potuisse aut non aeque commode potuisse, aut eum fugisse alias rationes
        commodiores propter cupiditatem. Hoc loco defensor demonstret oportet aut aliis quoque bono
        fuisse, aut alios quoque id quod ipse insimuletur facere potuisse. Signum est per quod
        ostenditur idonea perficiendi facultas esse quaesita. Id dividitur in partes sex: locum,
        tempus, spatium, occasionem, spem perficiendi, spem celandi. <note type="margin" n="7">7</note> Locus
        quaeritur, celebris an desertus, semper desertus an tum cum id factum sit, fuerit in eo loco

    <p> quid reo, quid accusatori conveniat perscribere non gravaremur, nisi facile quivis causa
        posita posset iudicare. Initia enim inventionis ab arte debent proficisci; cetera facile
        conparabit exercitatio. Tempus ita quaeritur: quid anni, qua hora—noctu an interdiu—et qua
        die, qua noctis hora factum esse dicatur, et cur eiusmodi temporibus. Spatium ita
        considerabitur: satisne longum fuerit ad eam rem transigendam, scieritne satis ad id
        perficiendum spatii futurum; nam parvi refert satis spatii fuisse ad id perficiendum si id
        ante sciri et ratione provideri non potuit. Occasio quaeritur, idoneane fuerit ad rem
        adoriendam, an alia melior quae aut praeterita sit aut non expectata. Spes perficiendi ecqua
        fuerit spectabitur hoc modo: si quae supra dicta sunt signa concurrent, si praeterea ex
        altera parte vires, pecunia, consilium, scientia, apparatio videbitur esse, ex altera parte
        inbecillitas, inopia, stultitia, inprudentia, inapparatio demonstrabitur fuisse; qua re

        <note type="margin" n="8">8</note> <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>V. Argumentum est per quod res coarguitur certioribus argumentis et
        magis firma suspicione. Id dividitur in tempora tria: praeteritum, instans, consequens. In
        praeterito tempore oportet considerare ubi fuerit, ubi visus sit, quicum visus sit, num quid
        appararit, num quem convenerit, num quid dixerit, num quid habuerit de consciis, de
        adiutoribus, de adiumentis; num quo in loco praeter consuetudinem fuerit aut alieno tempore.
        In instanti tempore quaeretur num visus sit cum faciebat, num qui strepitus, clamor,
        crepitus exauditus, aut denique num quid aliquo sensu perceptum sit, aspectu, auditu, tactu,
        odoratu, gustatu; nam quivis horum sensus potest conflare suspicionem. In consequenti
        tempore spectabitur num quid re transacta relictum sit quod indicet aut factum esse
        maleficium aut ab quo factum sit. Factum esse, hoc modo: si tumore et livore decoloratum
        corpus est mortui, significat eum veneno necatum. A quo factum sit, hoc modo: si telum, si
        vestimentum, si quid eiusmodi relictum aut si </p>

    <pb n="72"/>
    <p> vestigium rei repertum fuerit; si cruor in vestimentis; si in eo loco conprehensus aut
        visus, transacto negotio, quo in loco res gesta dicitur. Consecutio est cum quaeritur quae
        signa nocentis et innocentis consequi soleant. Accusator dicet, si poterit, adversarium, cum
        ad eum ventum sit, erubuisse, expalluisse, titubasse, inconstanter locutum esse, concidisse,
        pollicitum esse aliquid; quae signa conscientiae sint. Si reus horum nihil fecerit,
        accusator dicet eum usque adeo praemeditatum fuisse quid sibi esset usu venturum ut
        confidentissime resisteret, responderet;<app n="1"><note>1 responderet Mx
            brackets.</note></app> quae signa confidentiae, non innocentiae sint. Defensor, si
        pertimuerit, magnitudine periculi, non conscientia peccati se commotum esse dicet; si non
        pertimuerit, fretum innocentia negabit esse commotum. <note type="margin" n="9">9</note> <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>VI. Approbatio
        est qua utimur ad extremum confirmata suspicione. Ea habet locos proprios atque communes.
        Proprii sunt ii quibus nisi accusator nemo potest uti, et ii quibus nisi defensor. Communes
        sunt qui alia in causa ab reo, alia ab accusatore tradantur. In causa coniecturali proprius
        locus </p>

    <pb n="74"/>
    <p> accusatoris est cum dicit malorum misereri non oportere, et cum auget peccati atrocitatem.
        Defensoris proprius locus est cum misericordiam captat et cum accusatorem calumniari
        criminatur. Communes loci sunt cum accusatoris tum defensoris: abs testibus, contra testes;
        abs quaestionibus, contra quaestiones; ab argumentis, contra argumenta; ab rumoribus, contra
        rumores. A testibus dicemus secundum auctoritatem et vitam testium et constantiam
        testimoniorum. Contra testes: secundum<app n="1"><note>1 lacuna; secundum inserted by
                Schuetz.</note></app> vitae turpitudinem, testimoniorum inconstantiam; si aut fieri
        non potuisse dicemus aut non factum esse quod dicant, aut scire illos non potuisse, aut
        cupide dicere et argumentari. Haec et ad inprobationem et ad interrogationem testium
        pertinebunt. <note type="margin" n="10">10</note> <milestone unit="section" n="7"/> VII. A quaestionibus dicemus cum demonstrabimus

        coniectura tractatur trahemus ad veri similem suspicionem; idemque hoc in testimoniis facere
        oportebit. Contra quaestiones hoc modo dicemus: primum maiores voluisse certis in rebus
        interponi quaestiones cum quae vere dicerentur sciri, quae falso in quaestione
        pronuntiarentur refelli possent, hoc modo: quo in loco quid positum sit, et si quid esset
        simile quod videri aut vestigiis probari<app n="1"><note>1 lac.; aut vestigiis probari
                suugested by Mx.</note></app> aut aliquo simili signo percipi posset; deinde dolori
        credi non oportere, quod alius alio recentior sit in dolore, quod ingeniosior ad
        eminiscendum, quod denique saepe scire aut suspicari possit quid quaesitor velit audire;
        quod cum dixerit, intellegat sibi finem doloris futurum. Haec disputatio conprobabitur si
        refellemus quae in quaestionibus erunt dicta probabili argumentatione; idque partibus
        coniecturae quas ante exposuimus facere oportebit. <note type="margin" n="11">11</note> Ab argumentis et
        signis et ceteris locis quibus augetur suspicio dicere hoc modo convenit: Cum multa
        concurrant argumenta et signa quae inter se consentiant, rem perspicuam, non suspiciosam
        videri oportere. Item plus oportere signis et argumentis credi quam testibus, haec enim eo
        modo exponi quo </p>

    <pb n="78"/>
    <p> modo re vera sint gesta, testes corrumpi posse vel pretio vel gratia vel metu vel simultate.
        Contra argumenta et signa et ceteras suspiciones dicemus hoc modo: si demonstrabimus nullam
        rem esse quam non suspicionibus quivis possit criminari; deinde unam quamque suspicionem
        extenuabimus et dabimus operam ut ostendamus nihilo magis in nos eam quam in alium quempiam
        convenire; indignum facinus esse sine testibus coniecturam et suspicionem firmamenti satis
        habere. <note type="margin" n="12">12</note> <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>VIII. A rumoribus dicemus si negabimus temere famam nasci
        solere quin subsit aliquid; et si dicemus causam non fuisse quare quispiam confingeret et
        eminisceretur; et praeterea, si ceteri falsi soleant esse, argumentabimur hunc esse verum.
        Contra rumores dicemus primum si docebimus multos esse falsos rumores, et exemplis utemur de
        quibus falsa fama fuerit; et aut iniquos nostros aut homines natura malivolos et maledicos
        confinxisse dicemus; et aliquam aut fictam fabulam in adversarios ad-feremus quam dicamus
        omnibus in ore esse, aut verum rumorem proferemus qui illis aliquid turpitudinis adferat,
        neque tamen ei rumori nos fidem habere dicemus, ideo quod quivis unus homo possit quamvis
        turpem de quolibet rumorem proferre et confictam fabulam dissipare. Verumtamen si rumor
        vehementer probabilis esse videbitur, argumentando famae fidem poterimus abrogare. </p>

    <p> Quod et difficillima tractatu est constitutio coniecturalis et in veris causis saepissime

        fuisse in lege aut testamento aut stipulatione aut quolibet scripto quod ad eam rem

        iudicem sequi conveniat, utrum id quod diligenter perscriptum sit, an id quod acute sit
        excogitatum; deinde ea sententia quae ab adversariis sit excogitata et scripto adtributa
        contemnetur et infirmabitur. Deinde quaeretur quid periculi fuerit si id voluisset

        quod sine scripto intellegi potuerit non necessario scribendum putarit. Deinde dicemus
        calumniatoris esse officium verba et litteras sequi, neglegere voluntatem. Deinde id quod
        scriptum sit aut non posse fieri aut non lege, non more, non natura, non aequo et bono posse

        Cum duae leges inter se discrepant,<app n="2"><note>2 discrepant E: discrepent other MSS.

        utrum leges ita dissentiant ut altera iubeat, altera vetet, an ita ut altera cogat, altera

        lex permitteret; plus enim valet sanctio permissione. Item illa defensio tenuis est, cum
        ostenditur id factum esse quod ea lex sanciat cui legi obrogatum aut derogatum sit, id quod
        posteriore lege sanctum sit esse neglectum. Cum haec erunt considerata, statim nostrae legis
        expositione, recitatione, conlaudatione utemur. Deinde contrariae legis enodabimus
        voluntatem et eam trahemus ad nostrae causae commodum. Dein de iuridicali absoluta sumemus

        proferatur. Nos vero arbitramur non modo nullo adiumento esse, sed potius maximo
        inpedimento. Omnes enim illi amphibolias aucupantur, eas etiam quae ex altera parte
        sententiam nullam possunt interpretari. Itaque et alieni sermonis molesti interpellatores,
        et scripti cum odiosi tum obscuri interpretes sunt; et dum caute et expedite loqui volunt,
        infantissimi reperiuntur. Ita dum metuunt in dicendo ne quid ambiguum dicant, nomen suum
        pronuntiare non possunt. Verum horum pueriles opiniones rectissimis rationibus, cum voles,

        consilium venire, non visa est supersedenda. Cum ab nobis crimen removere volemus, aut in
        rem aut in hominem nostri peccati causam conferemus. Si causa in hominem conferetur,
        quaerendum erit primum potueritne tantum quantum reus demonstrabit is in quem causa
        conferetur; et quone modo aut honeste aut sine periculo potuerit obsisti; si maxime ita sit,
        num ea re concedi reo conveniat quod alieno inductu fecerit. Deinde in coniecturalem

    <pb n="106"/>
    <p> quemadmodum ipsas argumentationes ornate et absolute tractare possimus. Nam fere non

    <pb n="108"/>
    <p> quam ostendimus summatim quid sit quod probari volumus. Ratio est quae causam demonstrat
        verum esse id quod intendimus, brevi subiectione. Rationis confirmatio est ea quae pluribus
        argumentis corroborat breviter expositam rationem. Exornatio est qua utimur rei honestandae
        et conlocupletandae causa, confirmata argumentatione. Conplexio est quae concludit breviter,
        colligens partes argumentationis. Hisce igitur quinque partibus ut absolutissime utamur, hoc
        modo tractabimus argumentationem: <milestone unit="section" n="19"/>XIX. " Causam ostendemus Ulixi fuisse quare interfecerit
        Aiacem. " Inimicum enim acerrimum de medio tollere volebat, a quo sibi non iniuria summum

        se salutem sibi conparare; consueverat, si iure non potuerat, iniuria quavis inimico exitium

    <p> intercessisse demonstravi, non est dubium quin confiteatur causam maleficii fuisse." Ergo
        absolutissima est argumentatio ea quae ex quinque partibus constat, sed ea non semper
        necesse est uti. Est cum conplexione supersedendum est, si res brevis est, ut facile memoria
        conprehendatur; est cum exornatio praetermittenda est, si parum locuples ad amplificandum et
        exornandum res videtur esse. Sin et brevis erit argumentatio et res tenuis aut humilis, tum
        et exornatione et conplexione supersedendum est. In omni argumentatione de duabus partibus
        postremis haec quam exposui ratio est habenda. Ergo amplissima est argumentatio
        quinquepertita; brevissima est tripertita; mediocris, sublata aut exornatione aut
        conplexione, quadripertita. <note type="margin" n="31">31</note> <milestone unit="section" n="20"/>XX. Duo genera sunt vitiosarum
        argumentationum: unum quod ab adversario reprehendi potest, id quod pertinet ad causam;
        alterum quod tametsi nugatorium est, tamen non indiget reprehensionis. Quae sint quae
        reprehensione confutari conveniat, quae tacite contemni atque vitari sine reprehensione,
        nisi exempla subiecero, intellegere dilucide non poteris. Haec cognitio vitiosarum
        argumentationum duplicem utilitatem adferet. Nam et vitare in argumentatione vitium
        admonebit et ab aliis non vitatum commode reprehendere docebit. Quoniam igitur ostendimus
        perfectam et plenam argumentationem ex quinque partibus constare, in </p>

    <pb n="114"/>
    <p> una quaque parte argumentationis quae vitia vitanda sunt consideremus, ut et ipsi ab his
        vitiis recedere, et adversariorum argumentationes hac praeceptione in omnibus partibus
        temptare et ab aliqua parte labefactare possimus. <note type="margin" n="32">32</note> Expositio vitiosa
        est cum ab aliqua aut a maiore parte ad omnes confertur id quod non necessario est omnibus
        adtributum; ut si quis hoc modo exponat: " Omnes qui in paupertate sunt malunt maleficio
        parare divitias quam officio paupertatem tueri." Si qui hoc modo exposuerit argumentationem,
        ut non curet quaerere qualis ratio aut rationis confirmatio sit, ipsam facile reprehendemus
        expositionem cum ostendemus id quod in aliquo paupere inprobo sit in omnes pauperes falso et
        iniuria conferri. <note type="margin" n="33">33</note> Item vitiosa expositio est cum id quod raro fit
        fieri omnino negatur, hoc modo: " Nemo potest uno aspectu neque praeteriens in amorem
        incidere." Nam cum nonnemo devenerit in amorem uno aspectu, et cum ille neminem dixerit,
        omnino nihil differt raro id fieri, dummodo aliquando fieri aut posse modo fieri
        intellegatur. <milestone unit="section" n="21"/>XXI. Item vitiosa expositio est cum omnes res ostendemus nos collegisse et
        aliquam rem idoneam praeterimus, hoc modo: " Quoniam igitur hominem occisum constat esse,
        necesse est aut a praedonibus aut ab inimicis occisum esse aut abs te, quem ille </p>

    <pb n="116"/>
    <p> heredem testamento ex parte faciebat. Praedones in illo loco visi numquam sunt; inimicum
        nullum habebat; relinquitur, si neque a praedonibus neque ab inimicis occisus est, quod
        alteri non erant, alteros non habebat, ut abs te sit interemptus." Nam in huiuscemodi
        expositione reprehensione utemur si quos praeterquam quos ille conlegerit potuisse suscipere
        maleficium ostenderimus; velut in hoc exemplo, cum dixerit necesse esse aut a praedonibus
        aut ab inimicis aut a nobis occisum esse, dicemus potuisse vel a familia vel a coheredibus
        nostris. Cum hoc modo illorum conlectionem disturbaverimus, nobis latiorem locum defendendi
        reliquerimus. Ergo hoc quoque vitandum est in expositione, ne quando, cum omnia collegisse
        videamur, aliquam idoneam partem reliquerimus. <note type="margin" n="34">34</note> Item vitiosa
        expositio est quae constat ex falsa enumeratione, si aut cum plura sunt pauciora dicamus,
        hoc modo: " Duae res sunt, iudices, quae omnes ad maleficium impellant: luxuries et
        avaritia." " Quid amor? " inquiet quispiam, " quid ambitio? quid religio? quid metus mortis?
        quid imperii </p>

    <pb n="118"/>
    <p> cupiditas? quid denique alia permulta? " Item falsa enumeratio est cum pauciora sunt et
        plura dicimus, hoc modo: " Tres res sunt quae omnes homines sollicitent: metus, cupiditas,
        aegritudo/' Satis enim fuerat dixisse metum, cupiditatem., quoniam aegritudinem cum utraque
        re coniunctam esse necesse est. <milestone unit="section" n="22"/>XXII. Item vitiosa expositio est quae nimium longe
        reperitur, hoc modo: " Omnium malorum stultitia est mater atque materies. Ea parit immensas
        cupiditates. Immensae porro cupiditates infinitae, immoderatae sunt. Hae<app n="1"><note>1
                hae E: haec Μ Mx.</note></app> pariunt avaritiam. Avaritia porro hominem ad quodvis
        maleficium impellit. Ergo avaritia inducti adversarii nostri hoc in se facinus admiserunt."
        Hic id quod extremum dictum est satis fuit exponere, ne Ennium et ceteros poetas imitemur,
        quibus hoc modo loqui concessum est: Utinam ne in nemore Pelio securibus Caesae accidissent
        abiegnae ad terram trabes, Neve inde navis inchoandi exordium Coepisset quae nunc nominatur
        nomine Argo, quia Argivi in ea delecti viri Vecti petebant pellem inauratam arietis Colchis,

    <pb n="120"/>
    <p> Nam hic satis erat dicere, si id modo quod satis esset curarent poetae: Utinam ne era errans
        mea domo efferret pedem. Ergo hac quoque ab ultimo repetitione in expositionibus magnopere
        supersedendum est. Non enim reprehensionis<app n="1"><note>1 reprehensionis sugg. Mx:

        Vitiosa ratio est quae ad expositionem non est adcommodata vel propter infirmitatem vel
        propter vanitatem. Infirma ratio est quae non necessario ostendit ita esse quemadmodum
        expositum est, velut apud Plautum: Amicum castigare ob meritam noxiam Inmune est facinus,
        verum in aetate utile Et conducibile. Haec expositio est. Videamus quae ratio adferatur: Nam
        ego amicum hodie meum Concastigabo pro commerita noxia. Ex eo quod ipse facturus est, non ex
        eo quod fieri convenit, utile quid sit ratiocinatur. Vana ratio est quae ex falsa causa
        constat, hoc modo: "Amor fugiendus non est, nam ex eo verissima nascitur amicitia." Aut hoc
        modo: " Philosophia vitanda </p>

    <pb n="122"/>
    <p> est, adfert enim socordiam atque desidiam." Nam hae rationes nisi falsae essent,
        expositiones quoque earum veras esse confiteremur. <note type="margin" n="36">36</note> Itemque infirma
        ratio est quae non necessariam causam adfert expositionis, velut Pacuvius: Fortunam insanam
        esse et caecam et brutam perhibent philosophi Saxoque instare in globoso praedicant
        volubili; Id quo saxum inpulerit Fors, eo cadere Fortunam autumant. Caecam ob eam rem esse
        iterant, quia nihil cernat quo sese adplicet; Insanam autem esse aiunt, quia atrox, incerta
        instabilisque sit; Brutam, quia dignum atque indignum nequeat internoscere. Sunt autem alii
        philosophi qui contra Fortunam negant Ullam misera in aetate esse; Temeritatem esse
        autumant. Id magis veri simile esse usus reapse experiundo edocet; Velut Orestes modo fuit
        rex, factust mendicus modo. Naufragio nempe re ergo id factum, hau Forte aut Fortuna
        obtigit. Nam hic Pacuvius infirma ratione utitur cum ait verius esse Temeritate quam Fortuna
        res geri. Nam </p>

    <pb n="124"/>
    <p> utraque opinione philosophorum fieri potuit ut is qui rex fuisset mendicus factus esset.
            <note type="margin" n="37">37</note> <milestone unit="section" n="24"/>XXIV. Item infirma ratio est cum videtur pro ratione adferri,
        sed idem dicit quod in expositione dictum est, hoc modo: " Magno malo est hominibus
        avaritia, idcirco quod homines magnis et multis incommodis conflictantur propter immensam
        pecuniae cupiditatem." Nam hic aliis verbis idem per rationem dicitur quod dictum est per
        expositionem. Item infirma ratio est quae minus idoneam quam res postulat causam subicit
        expositionis, hoc modo: " Utilis est sapientia, propterea quod qui sapientes sunt pietatem
        colere consuerunt." Item: " Utile est amicos veros habere, habeas enim quibuscum iocari
        possis." Nam in huiusmodi rationibus non universa neque absoluta, sed extenuata ratione
        expositio confirmatur. Item infirma ratio est quae vel alii expositioni potest adcommodari,
        ut facit Pacuvius, qui eandem adfert rationem quare caeca, eandem quare bruta Fortuna
            dicatur.<app n="1"><note>1 dicatur IIE: dicitur other MSS. Mx.</note></app>
        <note type="margin" n="38">38</note> In confirmatione rationis multa et vitanda in nostra et observanda

        haec posterior ad excogitandum. </p>

    <p> Item vitiosa confirmatio est rationis cum ea re quae plures res significat abutimur pro
        certo unius rei signo, hoc modo: "Necesse est, quoniam pallet, aegrotasse; " aut " Necesse
        est peperisse, quoniam sustinet puerum infantem." Nam haec sua sponte certa signa non
        habent; sin cetera quoque similia concurrunt, nonnihil illiusmodi signa adaugent
        suspicionem. Item vitiosum est quando<app n="1"><note>1 quando d: quod other MSS.

                ><note>4 qui P2CE: si M Mx.</note></app> uxores ducunt." " At tu duxisti alteram."
        Item vitiosum est id quod vulgarem habet defensionem, hoc modo: "Iracundia deductus peccavit
        aut adulescentia aut amore." Huiuscemodi enim deprecationes si probabuntur, inpune maxima
        peccata dilabentur. Item vitiosum est cum id pro certo sumitur, quod inter omnes constat,
        quod etiam nunc in controversia est,<app n="5"><note>5 est Cbl: sit d: other MSS. Mx
                omit.</note></app> hoc modo: Eho tu, dii quibus est potestas motus superum atque

    <pb n="130"/>
    <p> Nam ita pro suo iure hoc exemplo utentem Thesprotum<app n="1"><note>1 thesprotum M:
                threspontem E (thespontem d): Chrespontem Mx.</note></app> Ennius induxit, quasi iam
        satis certis rationibus ita esse demonstrasset. <note type="margin" n="40">40</note> Item vitiosum est
        quod iam quasi sero atque acto negotio dici videtur, hoc modo: " In mentem mihi si venisset,
        Quirites, non commisissem ut in hunc locum res veniret, nam hoc aut hoc fecissem; sed me tum
        haec ratio fugit." Item vitiosum est cum id quod in aperto delicto positum est tamen aliqua
        tegitur defensione, hoc modo: Cum te expetebant omnes florentissimo Regno, reliqui; nunc
        desertum ab omnibus Summo periclo sola ut restituam paro. <milestone unit="section" n="26"/>XXVI. Item vitiosum est quod in
        aliam partem ac dictum sit potest accipi. Id est huiusmodi, ut si quis potens ac factiosus
        in contione dixerit: " Satius est uti regibus quam uti malis legibus." Nam et hoc, tametsi
        rei augendae causa potest sine malitia dici, tamen propter potentiam eius qui dicit non
        dicitur sine atroci suspicione. <note type="margin" n="41">41</note> Item vitiosum est falsis aut
        vulgaribus definitionibus uti. Falsae sunt huiusmodi, ut si quis dicat iniuriam </p>

    <pb n="132"/>
    <p> esse nullam nisi quae ex pulsatione aut convicio constet. Vulgares sunt quae nihilominus in
        aliam rem transferri possunt, ut si quis dicat: " Quadruplator, ut breviter scribam,
        capitalis est,<app n="1"><note>1 est C E: other MSS. Mx omit.</note></app> est enim inprobus
        et pestifer civis." Nam nihilo magis quadruplatoris quam furis, quam sicarii aut proditoris
        adtulit definitionem. Item vitiosum est pro argumento sumere quod in disquisitione positum
        est, ut si quis quem furti arguat et ita dicat eum esse hominem inprobum, avarum,
        fraudulentem; ei rei testimonium esse quod sibi furtum fecerit. Item vitiosum est
        controversiam controversia dis-solvere, hoc modo; " Non convenit, censores, istum vobis
        satis facere quod ait se non potuisse adesse ita ut iuratus fuerit.<app n="2"><note>2 fuerit
                M: fuerat E Mx.</note></app> Quid? si ad exercitum non venisset, idemne tribuno
        militum diceret? " Hoc ideo vitiosum est quia non expedita aut iudicata res, sed inpedita et
        in simili controversia posita exempli loco profertur. <note type="margin" n="42">42</note> Item vitiosum
        est cum id de quo summa controversia est parum expeditur et quasi transactum sit
        relinquitur, hoc modo: Aperte fatur dictio, si intellegas: Tali dari arma qualis qui gessit
        fuit Iubet, potiri si studeamus Pergamum. Quem ego me profiteor esse; me est aecum frui </p>

    <pb n="134"/>
    <p> Fraternis armis mihique adiudicarier, Vel quod propinquus vel quod virtute aemulus. Item
        vitiosum est ipsum sibi in sua oratione dissentire et contra atque ante dixerit dicere, hoc
        modo: "Qua causa accusem hunc?", tum id exputando evolvere: Nam si veretur, quid eum accuses
        qui est probus? Sin inverecundum animi ingenium possidet, Quid autem eum accuses qui id
        parvi auditum aestimet? <milestone unit="section" n="27"/>XXVII. Non incommoda ratione videtur sibi ostendisse quare non
        accusaret. Quid postea? quid ait? Nunc ego te ab summo iam detexam exordio. <note type="margin" n="43"
            >43</note> Item vitiosum est quod dicitur contra iudicis voluntatem aut eorum qui
        audiunt, si aut partes quibus illi student, aut homines quos illi caros habent laedantur,
        aut aliquo eiusmodi vitio laeditur auditoris voluntas. Item vitiosum est non omnes res
        confirmare quas pollicitus sis in expositione. Item verendum est ne de alia re dicatur, cum
        alia de re controversia sit; inque eiusmodi vitio considerandum est ne aut ad rem addatur
        quid, aut quippiam de re detrahatur, aut tota causa mutata in </p>

    <pb n="136"/>
    <p> aliam causam derivetur; uti apud Pacuvium Zethus<app n="1"><note>1 Zethus MSS.: faciunt
                Zethus Mx.</note></app> cum Amphione, quorum controversia de musica inducta
        disputatione in sapientiae rationem et virtutis utilitatem consumitur. Item considerandum
        est ne aliud accusatoris criminatio contineat, aliud defensoris purgatio purget, quod saepe
        consulto multi ab reo faciunt angustiis causae coacti; ut si quis, cum accusetur ambitu
        magistratum petisse, ab imperatoribus saepe numero apud exercitum donis militaribus se
            dicat<app n="2"><note>2 lac.; donis militaribus se dicat sugg. M x.</note></app> donatum
        esse. Hoc si diligenter in oratione adversariorum observaverimus, saepe deprehendemus eos de
        ea re quod dicant non habere. <note type="margin" n="44">44</note> Item vitiosum est artem aut scientiam
        aut studium quodpiam vituperare propter eorum vitia qui in eo studio sunt; veluti qui
        rhetoricam vituperant propter alicuius oratoris vituperandam vitam. Item vitiosum est ex eo,
        quia perperam factum constet esse, putare ostendi a certo homine factum esse, hoc modo:
        "Mortuum deformatum, tumore praeditum, corpore decoloratum constat fuisse; ergo veneno
        necatus est." Deinde si sit usque in eo </p>

    <pb n="138"/>
    <p> occupatus, ut multi faciunt, venenum datum, vitio non mediocri conflictetur. Non enim
        factumne sit quaeritur, sed a quo factum sit. <note type="margin" n="45">45</note> <milestone unit="section" n="28"/>XXVIII. Item vitiosum
        est in conparandis rebus alteram rem efferre, de re altera mentionem non facere aut
        neglegentius disputare; ut si cum conparetur utrum satius sit populum frumentum accipere an
        non accipere, quae commoda sint in altera re vera curet enumeret, quae in altera incommoda
        sint et quae velit depressa praetereat, aut ea quae minima sint dicat. Item vitiosum est in
        rebus conparandis necesse putare<app n="1"><note>1 putare Lambinus: putari MSS.
            Mx.</note></app> alteram rem vituperare<app n="2"><note>2 vituperare E: vituperari other
                MSS. Mx.</note></app> cum alteram laudes; quod genus, si quaeratur utris maior honor
        habendus sit, Albensibus an Vestinis Pennensibus, quod<app n="3"><note>3 quod P2BC2l Mx ed.
                mai.: quo M Mx: qui b d.</note></app> rei publicae populi Romani profuerint, et is
        qui dicat alteros laedat. Non enim necesse est, si alteros praeponas, alteros vituperare;
        fieri enim potest ut, cum alteros magis laudaris, aliquam alteris partem laudis adtribuas,
        ne cupide depugnasse contra veritatem puteris. </p>

    <pb n="140"/>
    <p> Item vitiosum est de nomine et vocabulo controversiam struere quam rem consuetudo optime
        potest iudicare; velut Sulpicius, qui intercesserat ne exules quibus causam dicere non
        licuisset reducerentur, idem posterius, immutata voluntate, cum eandem legem ferret, aliam
        se ferre<app n="1"><note>1 aliam se ferre IICP2 Mx ed. mai.: aliam sese ferre E: alios
                efferre H: aliose ferre P: alio se ferre Mx: aliis e ferre B.</note></app> dicebat
        propter nominum commutationem; nam non exules, sed vi eiectos se reducere aiebat. Proinde
        quasi id fuisset in controversia, quo illi nomine appellarentur, aut proinde quasi non omnes
        quibus aqua et igni interdictum est exules appellentur. Verum illi fortasse ignoscimus si
        cum causa fecit; nos tamen intellegamus vitiosum esse intendere controversiam propter
        nominum mutationem. <note type="margin" n="46">46</note> <milestone unit="section" n="29"/>XXIX. Quoniam exornatio constat ex similibus et
        exemplis et amplificationibus et rebus iudicatis et ceteris rebus quae pertinent ad
        exaugendam et conlocupletandam argumentationem, quae sint his rebus vitia consideremus. </p>

    <pb n="142"/>
    <p> Simile vitiosum est quod ex<app n="1"><note>1 quod ex BC II: id quod ex E: quode P: quod de
                H Mx.</note></app> aliqua parte dissimile est nec habet parem rationem conparationis
        aut sibi ipsi obest qui adfert. Exemplum vitiosum est si aut falsum est, ut reprehendatur,
        aut inprobum, ut non sit imitandum, aut maius aut minus quam res postulat. Res iudicata
        vitiose proferetur si aut dissimili de re proferetur, aut de ea re qua de controversia non
        est, aut inproba, aut eiusmodi ut aut plures aut magis idoneae res iudicatae ab adversariis
        proferri possint. Item vitiosum est id quod adversarii factum esse confiteantur, de eo
        argumentari et planum facere factum esse; nam id augeri oportet. Item vitiosum est id augere
        quod convenit docere, hoc modo: ut si quis quem arguat hominem occidisse et, antequam satis
        idoneas argumentationes ad-tulerit, augeat peccatum et dicat nihil indignius esse quam
        hominem occidere. Non enim utrum indignum sit an non, sed factumne sit quaeritur. Conplexio
        vitiosa est quae non quidque quod<app n="2"><note>2 non quidque quod C2d: non quique quod

        Nam constant ex enumeratione, amplificatione, et commiseratione. Quattuor locis uti possumus
        conclusionibus: in principio, secundum narrationem, secundum firmissimam argumentationem, in
        conclusione. Enumeratio est per quam colligimus et commonemus quibus de rebus verba
        fecerimus, breviter, ut renovetur, non redintegretur oratio; et ordine ut quicquid erit
        dictum referemus, ut auditor, si memoriae mandaverit, ad idem quod ipse meminerit reducatur.
        Item curandum est ne aut ab exordio aut narratione repetatur orationis enumeratio. Ficta </p>

    <pb n="146"/>
    <p> enim et dedita opera conparata oratio videbitur esse artificii significandi, ingenii
        venditandi, memoriae ostendendae causa. Quapropter initium enumerationis sumendum est a

        confirmatione et confutatione. Amplificatio est res quae per locum communem instigationis
        auditorum causa sumitur. Loci communes ex decem praeceptis commodissime sumentur adaugendi
        criminis causa. <note type="margin" n="48">48</note> Primus locus sumitur ab auctoritate, cum
        commemoramus quantae curae ea res fuerit dis immortalibus aut maioribus nostris, regibus,
        civitatibus, nationibus, hominibus sapientissimis, senatui; item maxime quo modo de his
        rebus legibus sanctum sit. Secundus locus est cum consideramus illae res de quibus
        criminamur ad quos pertineant; utrum ad omnes, quod atrocissimum est; an ad superiores, </p>

    <pb n="148"/>
    <p> quod genus ii sunt a quibus auctoritatis locus communis sumitur; an ad pares, hoc est, in
        isdem partibus animi, corporis, fortunarum positos; an ad inferiores, qui his omnibus rebus
        antecelluntur. Tertius locus est quo percontamur quid sit eventurum si omnibus idem
        concedatur, et, ea re neglecta, ostendemus quid periculorum atque incommodorum consequatur.
        Quartus locus est quo demonstratur, si huic sit permissum, multos alacriores ad maleficium
        futuros, quod adhuc expectatio iudicii remoratur. Quintus locus est cum ostendimus, si semel
        aliter iudicatum sit, nullam rem fore quae incommodo mederi aut erratum iudicum corrigere
        possit. Quo in loco non incommodum erit uti ceterarum rerum conparatione, ut ostendamus
        alias res posse aut vetustate sedari aut consilio corrigi, huius rei aut leniendae aut
        corrigendae nullam rem adiumento futuram. <note type="margin" n="49">49</note> Sextus est locus cum
        ostendimus et consulto factum et dicimus voluntario facinori nullam esse excusationem,
        inprudentiae iustam deprecationem paratam. Septimus locus est quo ostendimus taetrum
        facinus, crudele, nefarium, tyrannicum esse; quod genus iniuria mulierum, aut earum rerum
        aliquid quarum rerum causa bella suscipiuntur et cum hostibus de vita dimicatur. </p>

    <pb n="150"/>
    <p> Octavus locus est quo ostendimus non vulgare, sed singulare esse maleficium, spurcum,
        nefarium, in-usitatum; quo maturius et atrocius vindicandum est. Nonus locus est qui constat
        ex peccatorum conparatione, quasi cum dicemus maius esse maleficium stuprare ingenuum quam
        sacrum legere, quod alterum propter egestatem, alterum propter in-temperantem superbiam
        fiat. Decimus locus est per quem omnia quae in negotio gerundo acta sunt quaeque rem
        consequi solent exputamus acriter et criminose et diligenter, ut agi res et geri negotium
        videatur rerum consequentium enumeratione. <note type="margin" n="50">50</note> <milestone unit="section" n="31"/>XXXI. Misericordia
        commovebitur auditoribus si variam fortunarum commutationem dicemus; si ostendemus in quibus
        commodis fuerimus quibusque incommodis simus, conparatione; si quae nobis futura sint nisi
        causam obtinuerimus enumerabimus et ostendemus; si supplicabimus et nos sub eorum quorum
        misericordiam captabimus potestatem subi-ciemus: si quid nostris parentibus, liberis,

        si nos semper aut diu in malis fuisse ostendemus; si nostrum fatum aut fortunam conqueremur;
        si animum nostrum fortem, patientem incommodorum ostendemus futurum. Commiserationem brevem
        esse oportet, nihil enim lacrima citius arescit. Fere locos obscurissimos totius artificii

        videbantur, in quarto libro conscribere maluimus, quem, ut arbitror, tibi librum celeriter

    <p> potius, hoc modo: Kartago tollenda an relinquenda videatur. Quid potissimum, hoc pacto: ut
        si Hannibal consultet, cum ex Italia Kartaginem arcessatur, an in Italia remaneat, an domum
        redeat, an in Aegyptum profectus occupet Alexandriam. Item deliberationes partim ipsae
        propter se consultandae sunt, ut si deliberet senatus captivos ab hostibus redimat an non;
        partim propter aliquam extraneam causam veniunt in deliberationem et consultationem, ut si
        deliberet senatus solvatne legibus Scipionem ut eum liceat ante tempus consulem fieri;

    <p> idoneo tempore loquemur si quando de re militari aut de administratione rei publicae

        et officio fit. Id dividitur in prudentiam, iustitiam, fortitudinem, modestiam. Prudentia
        est calliditas quae ratione quadam potest dilectum habere bonorum et malorum. Dicitur item
        prudentia scientia cuiusdam artificii; item appellatur prudentia rerum multarum memoria et
        usus conplurium negotiorum. Iustitia est aequitas ius uni cuique rei tribuens pro dignitate
        cuiusque. Fortitudo est rerum magnarum appetitio et rerum humilium contemptio et laboris cum
        utilitatis ratione perpessio. Modestia est in animo continens moderatio cupiditatem. <note

        quamquam ex recto laudabile nascitur, tamen in dicendo seorsum tractandum est hoc ab illo.
        Neque enim solum laudis causa rectum sequi convenit, sed si laus consequitur, duplicatur

        per quam illa quae invenimus in ordinem redigimus ut certo quicquid loco pronuntietur,
        videndum est cuiusmodi rationem in disponendo habere conveniat. Genera dispositionum sunt
        duo: unum ab institutione artis profectum, alterum ad casum temporis adcommodatum. Ex
        institutione artis disponemus cum sequemur cam praeceptionem quam in primo libro exposuimus,
        hoc est ut utamur principio, narratione, divisione, confirmatione, confutatione,
        conclusione, et ut hunc ordinem quemadmodum praeceptum est ante in dicendo sequamur. Item ex
        institutione artis non modo totas causas per orationem, sed singulas quoque argumentationes
        disponemus, quemadmodum in libro secundo docuimus: in expositionem, rationem, confirmationem
        rationis, exornationem, conclusionem. <note type="margin" n="17">17</note> Haec igitur duplex dispositio
        est: una per orationes, </p>


    <pb n="186"/>
    <p> altera per argumentationes, ab institutione artis profecta. Est autem alia dispositio, quae,
        cum ab ordine artificioso recedendum est, oratoris iudicio ad tempus adcommodatur; ut si ab
        narratione dicere incipiamus aut ab aliqua firmissima argumentatione aut litterarum
        aliquarum recitatione; aut si secundum principium confirmatione utamur, deinde narratione;
        aut si quam eiusmodi permutationem ordinis faciemus; quorum nihil, nisi causa postulat,
        fieri oportebit. Nam si vehementer aures auditorum obtunsae videbuntur atque animi
        defatigati ab adversariis multitudine verborum, commode poterimus principio supersedere
            et<app n="1"><note>1 et BCE: HPIΙ Mx omit.</note></app> exordiri causam aut a narratione
        aut aliqua firma argumentatione. Deinde, si commodum erit, quod non semper necesse est, ad

        habere, ut nemo aequo animo principium possit audire, ab narratione cum inceperimus, ad
        principii sententiam revertemus. Si narratio parum probabilis, exordiemur ab aliqua firma
        argumentatione. His commutationibus et translationibus saepe uti necesse est cum ipsa res
        artificiosam dispositionem artificiose commutare cogit. </p>

        quae si separatim ac singulae dicantur infirmae sint, cum ceteris coniunctae firmae et

        qua re causa confirmari possit— quapropter continuo firmam aliquam oportet inferre
        argumentationem; et reliqua, quoniam nuperrime dictum facile memoriae mandatur, utile est,
        cum dicere desinamus, recentem aliquam relinquere in animis auditorum bene firmam

        Pronuntiationem multi maxime utilem oratori dixerunt esse et ad persuadendum plurimum

    <p> Nam commodae inventiones et concinnae verborum elocutiones et partium causae artificiosae
        dispositiones et horum omnium diligens memoria sine pronuntatione non plus quam sine his
        rebus pronuntiatio sola valere poterit. Quare, et quia nemo de ea re diligenter scripsit—nam
        omnes vix posse putarunt de voce et vultu et gestu dilucide scribi, cum eae res ad sensus
        nostros pertinerent—et quia magnopere ea pars a nobis ad dicendum conparanda est, non
        neglegenter videtur tota res consideranda. Dividitur igitur pronuntiatio in vocis figuram et
        in corporis motum. Figura vocis est ea quae suum quendam possidet habitum ratione et
        industria <note type="margin" n="20">20</note> conparatum. Ea dividitur in tres partes: magnitudinem,
        firmitudinem, mollitudinem. Magnitudinem vocis maxime conparat natura; nonnihil auget, sed
        maxime conservat adcuratio.<app n="1"><note>1 conservat accuratio MS. used by Lambinus:

        Mollitudinem vocis, hoc est ut eam torquere in dicendo nostro commodo possimus, maxime
        faciet exercitatio declamationis. Quapropter de magnitudine vocis et firmitudinis parte,
        quoniam altera natura paritur, altera cura conparatur, nihil nos adtinet commonere nisi ut
        ab iis qui non inscii sunt eius artificii ratio curandae vocis petatur. <milestone unit="section" n="12"/>XII. De ea parte
        firmitudinis quae conservatur ratione declamationis, et de mollitudine vocis, quae maxime
        necessaria est oratori, quoniam ea quoque moderatione declamationis conparatur, dicendum
        videtur. <note type="margin" n="21">21</note> Firmam ergo maxime poterimus in dicendo vocem conservare
        si quam maxime sedata et depressa voce principia dicemus. Nam laeditur arteria si antequam
        voce leni permulsa est acri clamore completur. Et intervallis longioribus uti convenit;
        recreatur enim spiritu vox et arteriae reticendo adquiescunt. Et in continuo clamore
        remittere et ad sermonem transire oportet; commutationes enim faciunt ut nullo genere vocis
        effuso in omni voce integri simus. Et acutas vocis exclamationes vitare debemus; ictus enim
        fit et vulnus arteriae acuta atque adtenuata nimis adclamatione, et qui splendor est vocis
        consumitur uno clamore universus. Et uno spiritu continenter multa dicere in extrema
        convenit oratione; fauces </p>


    <pb n="194"/>
    <p> enim calefiunt, et arteriae conplentur, et vox, quae tractata varie est, reducitur in
        quendam sonum aequabilem atque constantem. Quam saepe rerum naturae gratia quaedam iure
        debetur, velut accidit in hac re! Nam quae dicimus ad vocem servandam prodesse, eadem
        adtinent ad suavitudinem pronuntiationis, ut quod nostrae voci prosit idem voluntati <note
            type="margin" n="22">22</note> auditoris probetur. Utile est ad firmitudinem sedata vox in
        principio. Quid insuavius quam clamor in exordio causae? Intervalla vocem confirmant; eadem
        sententias concinniores divisione reddunt et auditori spatium cogitandi relinquunt.
        Conservat vocem continui clamoris remissio, et auditorem quidem varietas maxime delectat,
        cum sermone animum retinet aut exsuscitat clamore. Acuta exclamatio vocem vulnerat; eadem
        laedit auditorem, habet enim quiddam inliberale et ad muliebrem potius vociferationem quam
        ad virilem dignitatem in dicendo adcommodatum. In extrema oratione continens vox remedio est
        voci. Quid? haec eadem nonne animum vehementissime calefacit auditoris in totius conclusione
        causae? Quoniam igitur eadem vocis firmitudini et pronuntiationis suavitudini prosunt, de
        utraque re simul erit in praesentia dictum—de firmitudine quae visa sunt, de suavitudine
        quae coniuncta fuerunt; cetera suo loco paulo post dicemus. </p>

        praeceptionem pertinet, diligentius nobis consideranda est. Eam dividimus in sermonem,
        contentionem, amplificationem. Sermo est oratio remissa et finitima cotidianae locutioni.
        Contentio est oratio acris et ad confirmandum et ad confutandum adcommodata. Amplificatio
        est oratio quae aut in iracundiam inducit, aut ad misericordiam trahit auditoris animum.
        Sermo dividitur in partes quattuor: dignitatem, demonstrationem, narrationem, iocationem.
        Dignitas est oratio cum aliqua gravitate et vocis remissione. Demonstratio est oratio quae
        docet remissa voce quomodo quid fieri potuerit aut non potuerit. Narratio est rerum gestarum
        aut proinde ut gestarum expositio. locatio est oratio quae ex aliqua re risum pudentem et
        liberalem potest conparare. Contentio dividitur in continuationem et in distributionem.
        Continuatio est orationis enuntiandae adceleratio clamosa. Distributio est in contentione
        oratio frequens cum raris et brevibus intervallis, acri vociferatione. <note type="margin" n="24"
            >24</note> Amplificatio dividitur in cohortationem et conquestionem. Cohortatio est
        oratio quae aliquod </p>

    <p> peccatum amplificans auditorem ad iracundiam adducit. Conquestio est oratio quae
        incommodorum amplificatione animum auditoris ad misericordiam perducit. Quoniam igitur
        mollitudo vocis in tres partes divisa est, et eae partes ipsae sunt in octo partes alias
        distributae, harum octo partium quae cuiusque idonea pronuntiatio sit demonstrandum videtur.
        <milestone unit="section" n="14"/>XIV. Sermo cum est in dignitate, plenis faucibus quam sedatissima et depressissima voce uti
        conveniet, ita tamen ut ne ab oratoria consuetudine ad tragicam transeamus. Cum autem est in
        demonstratione, voce paululum attenuata, crebris intervallis et divisionibus oportet uti, ut
        in ipsa pronuntiatione eas res quas demonstrabimus inserere atque insecare videamur in
        animis auditorum. Cum autem est sermo in narratione, vocum varietates opus sunt, ut quo
        quidque pacto gestum sit ita narrare videamur.<app n="1"><note>1 videamur ld: videatur other

        voce, cum parva significatione risus, sine ulla suspicione nimiae cachinnationis leniter
        oportebit ab sermone serio torquere verba ad liberalem iocum. Cum autem contendere
        oportebit, quoniam id aut per continuationem aut per distributionem faciendumst, in
        continuatione, adaucto mediocriter sono vocis,<app n="1"><note>1 vocis P2 C II E Mx ed.

        et torquere sonum et celeriter cum clamore verba conficere, ut vim volubilem orationis
        vociferatio consequi possit. In distributione vocis ab imis faucibus exclamationem quam
        clarissimam adhibere oportet, et quantum spatii in singulas exclamationes sumpserimus,
        tantum in singula intervalla spatii consumere iubemur. In amplificationibus cum cohortatione
        utemur voce adtenuatissima, clamore leni, sono aequabili, commutationibus crebris, maxima

        qui paulo ante demonstrabatur in dignitate. Sin in iocatione, vultu quandam debebimus

        rhetoricae custodem, memoriam, transeamus. Memoria utrum habeat quiddam artificiosi, an
        omnis ab natura proficiscatur, aliud dicendi tempus magis idoneum dabitur. Nunc proinde
        atque constet in hac re multum valere artem et praeceptionem, ita de ea re loquemur. Placet
        enim nobis esse artificium </p>


    <pb n="206"/>
    <p> memoriae—quare placeat alias ostendemus; in praesentia cuiusmodi sit ea aperiemus. Sunt
        igitur duae memoriae: una naturalis, altera artificiosa. Naturalis est ea quae nostris
        animis insita est et simul cum cogitatione nata; artificiosa est ea quam confirmat inductio
        quaedam et ratio praeceptionis. Sed qua via in ceteris rebus ingenii bonitas imitatur saepe
        doctrinam, ars porro naturae commoda confirmat et auget, item fit in hac re ut nonnumquam
        naturalis memoria, si cui data est <note type="margin" n="29">29</note> egregia, similis sit huic
        artificiosae, porro haec artificiosa naturae commoda retineat et amplificet ratione
        doctrinae. Quapropter et naturalis memoria praeceptione confirmanda est ut sit egregia, et
        haec quae doctrina datur indiget ingenii. Nec hoc magis aut minus in hac re quam in ceteris
        artibus fit, ut ingenio doctrina, praeceptione natura nitescat. Quare et illis qui natura
        memores sunt utilis haec erit institutio, quod tute paulo post poteris intellegere; et si
        illi, freti ingenio, nostri non indigerent, tamen iusta causa daretur quare iis qui minus
        ingenii habent adiumento velimus esse. Nunc de artificiosa memoria loquemur. </p>


    <pb n="208"/>
    <p> Constat igitur artificiosa memoria ex locis et<app n="1"><note>1 ex locis M: locis et E

        aut natura aut manu sunt absoluti. ut eos facile naturali memoria conprehendere et amplecti
        queamus: ut aedes, intercolumnium, angulum, fornicem, et alia quae his similia sunt.
        Imagines sunt formae quaedam et notae et simulacra eius rei quam meminisse volumus; quod
        genus equi, leonis, aquilae memoriam si volemus habere, imagines <note type="margin" n="30">30</note>
        eorum locis certis conlocare oportebit. Nunc cuiusmodi locos invenire et quo pacto reperire
        et in locis imagines constituere oporteat ostendemus. <milestone unit="section" n="17"/>XVII. Quemadmodum igitur qui litteras
        sciunt possunt id quod dictatur eis scribere, et recitare quod scripserunt, item qui

        in locis conlocare et ex his memoriter pronuntiare. Nam loci cerae aut chartae simillimi
        sunt, imagines litteris, dispositio et conlocatio imaginum scripturae, pronuntiatio
        lectioni. Oportet igitur, si volumus multa meminisse, multos nos nobis locos conparare, uti
        multis locis multas imagines conlocare possimus. Item putamus oportere ex ordine hos locos

        edere possimus; <milestone unit="section" n="18"/>XVIII. nam ut, si in ordine stantes notos complures viderimus, nihil nostra

        commoniti, dicere possimus id quod locis manda-<note type="margin" n="31">31</note> verimus. Quare
        placet et ex ordine locos conparare. Locos quos sumpserimus egregie commeditari oportebit,
        ut perpetuo nobis haerere possint; nam imagines, sicuti litterae, delentur ubi nihil utimur;
        loci, tamquam cera, remanere debent. Et ne forte in numero locorum falli possimus, quintum
        quemque placet notari; quod genus si in quinto loco manum auream conlocemus, si in decimo

        in derelicta quam in celebri regione locos conparare, propterea quod frequentia et
        obambulatio hominum conturbat et infirmat imaginum notas, solitudo conservat integras
        simulacrorum figuras. Praeterea dissimiles forma atque natura loci conparandi sunt, ut

        quid in quoque<app n="1"><note>1 quoque Ml: uno quoque d: quoquo b Mx.</note></app> loco
        conlocarit. Et magnitudine modica et mediocres locos habere oportet; nam et praeter modum
        ampli vagas imagines reddunt, et nimis angusti saepe non videntur posse capere imaginum
            <note type="margin" n="32">32</note> conlocationem. Tum nec nimis inlustres nec vehementer obscuros
        locos habere oportet, ne aut obcaecentur tenebris imagines aut splendore praefulgeant.
        Inter-valla locorum mediocria placet esse, fere paulo plus aut minus pedum tricenum; nam ut
        aspectus item cogitatio minus valet sive nimis procul removeris sive vehementer prope
        admoveris id quod oportet videri. Sed quamquam facile est ei qui paulo plura noverit quamvis
        multos et idoneos locos conparare, tamen si qui satis idoneos invenire se non putabit, ipse
        sibi constituat quam volet multos licebit. Cogitatio enim quamvis regionem potest amplecti,
        et in ea situm loci cuiusdam ad suum arbitrium fabricari et architectari. Quare licebit, si
        hac prompta copia contenti non erimus, nosmet ipsos nobis cogitatione nostra regionem
        constituere, et idoneorum locorum commodissimam distinctionem conparare. De locis satis
        dictum est; nunc ad imaginum rationem transeamus. <note type="margin" n="33">33</note> <milestone unit="section" n="20"/>XX. Quoniam ergo
        rerum similes imagines esse oportet, ex omnibus rebus nosmet nobis similitudines eligere
        debemus. Duplices igitur similitudines esse </p>


    <pb n="214"/>
    <p> debent, unae rerum, alterae verborum. Rerum similitudines exprimuntur cum summatim ipsorum
        negotiorum imagines conparamus; verborum similitudines constituuntur cum unius cuiusque
        nominis et vocabuli memoria imagine notatur. Rei totius memoriam saepe una nota et imagine
        simplici conprehendimus; hoc modo, ut si accusator dixerit ab reo hominem veneno necatum et
        hereditatis causa factum arguerit et eius rei multos dixerit testes et conscios esse. Si hoc
        primum, ut ad defendendum nobis expeditum sit, meminisse volemus, in primo loco rei totius
        imaginem conformabimus; aegrotum in lecto cubantem faciemus ipsum illum de quo agetur, si
        formam eius detinebimus; si eum non agnoverimus,<app n="1"><note>1 agnoverimus E: other MSS.

        mentem venire possit. Et reum ad lectum eius adstituemus, dextera poculum, sinistra tabulas,
        medico testiculos arietinos tenentem. Hoc modo et testium et hereditatis et <note type="margin" n="34"
            >34</note> veneno necari memoriam habere poterimus. Item deinceps cetera crimina ex
        ordine in locis ponemus et quotienscumque rem meminisse volemus, si formarum dispositione et
        imaginum diligenti notatione utemur, facile ea quae volemus memoria consequemur. </p>


    <pb n="216"/>
    <p> <milestone unit="section" n="21"/>XXI. Cum verborum similitudines imaginibus exprimere volemus, plus negotii suscipiemus et
        magis ingenium nostrum exercebimus. Id nos hoc modo facere oportebit: Iam domum itionem
        reges Atridae parant. Hunc versum meminisse si volemus, conveniet primo<app n="1"><note>1

        constituere manus ad caelum tollentem Domitium cum a Regibus Marciis loris caedatur— hoc
        erit " Iam domum itionem reges; " in altero loco Aesopum et Cimbrum subornari ut ad
            Iphigeniam<app n="2"><note>2 Ephigeniam MSS. Mx.</note></app> in Agamemnonem et
        Menelaum—hoc erit " Atridae parant." Hoc modo omnia verba erunt expressa. Sed haec imaginum
        conformatio tum valet si naturalem memoriam exsuscitaverimus hac notatione, ut versu posito
        ipsi nobiscum primum transeamus bis aut ter eum versum, deinde tum imaginibus verba
        exprimamus. Hoc modo naturae suppeditabitur doctrina. Nam utraque altera separata minus erit
        firma, ita tamen ut multo plus in doctrina atque arte praesidii sit. Quod docere non
        gravaremur, ni </p>


    <pb n="218"/>
    <p> metueremus ne, cum ab instituto nostro recessissemus, minus commode servaretur haec dilucida
        brevitas praeceptionis. <note type="margin" n="35">35</note> Nunc, quoniam solet accidere ut imagines
        partim firmae et acres et ad monendum idoneae sint, partim inbecillae et infirmae quae vix
        memoriam possint excitare, qua de causa utrumque fiat considerandum est, ut, cognita causa,
        quas vitemus et quas sequamur imagines scire possimus. <milestone unit="section" n="22"/>XXII. Docet igitur nos ipsa natura
        quid oporteat fieri. Nam si quas res in vita videmus parvas, usitatas, cotidianas, meminisse
        non solemus, propterea quod nulla nova nec admirabili re commovetur animus; at si quid
        videmus aut audimus egregie turpe, inhonestum, inusitatum, magnum, incredibile, ridiculum,
        id diu meminisse consuevimus. Itaque quas res ante ora videmus aut audimus obliviscimur
        plerumque; quae acciderunt in pueritia meminimus optime saepe; nec hoc alia de causa potest
        accidere nisi quod usitatae res facile e memoria dabuntur, <note type="margin" n="36">36</note> insignes
        et novae diutius manent in animo. Solis exortus, cursus, occasus nemo admiratur propterea
        quia cotidie fiunt; at eclipses<app n="1"><note>1 eclipsis II b d Mx: eclypsis HBCl:
                aeglypsis P.</note></app> solis mirantur quia raro accidunt, et solis eclipses<app

        usitata re non exsuscitari, novitate et insigni quodam negotio commoveri. Imitetur ars
        igitur naturam, et quod ea desiderat id </p>

    <p> inveniat, quod ostendit sequatur. Nihil est enim quod aut natura extremum invenerit aut
        doctrina primum; sed rerum principia ab ingenio profecta sunt, exitus disciplina
        conparantur. <note type="margin" n="37">37</note> Imagines igitur nos in eo genere constituere oportebit
        quod genus in memoria diutissime potest haerere. Id accidet si quam maxime notatas
        similitudines constituemus; si non multas nec vagas, sed aliquid agentes imagines ponemus;
        si egregiam pulcritudinem aut unicam turpitudinem eis adtribuemus; si aliquas exornabimus,
        ut si coronis aut veste purpurea, quo nobis notatior sit similitudo; aut si qua re
        deformabimus, ut si cruentam aut caeno oblitam aut rubrica delibutam inducamus, quo magis
        insignita sit forma, aut ridiculas res aliquas imaginibus adtribuamus, nam ea res quoque
        faciet ut facilius meminisse valeamus. Nam quas res veras facile meminimus,<app n="1"
                ><note>1 meminimus P2BCTld: minus HP: meminerimus blMx.</note></app> easdem fictas
        et diligenter notatas meminisse non difficile est. Sed illud facere oportebit, ut identidem

            >38</note> <milestone unit="section" n="23"/>XXIII. Scio plerosque Graecos qui de memoria scripserunt fecisse ut multorum
        verborum imagines conscriberent, uti qui ediscere vellent paratas haberent, ne quid in
        quaerendo consumerent operae. Quorum rationem aliquot de causis inprobamus: </p>


    <pb n="222"/>
    <p> primum, quod in verborum innumerabili multitudine ridiculumst mille verborum imagines
        conparare. Quantulum enim poterunt haec valere, cum ex infinita verborum copia modo aliud
        modo aliud nos verbum meminisse oportebit? Deinde, cur volumus ab industria quemquam
        removere, ut, ne quid ipse quaerat, nos illi omnia parata quaesita tradamus? Praeterea,
        similitudine alia alius magis commovetur. Nam ut saepe, formam si quam similem cuipiam
        dixerimus esse, non omnes habemus adsensores, quod alii videtur aliud, item fit in
        imaginibus ut quae nobis diligenter notata sit, ea parum videatur insignis aliis. <note
            type="margin" n="39">39</note> Quare sibi quemque suo commodo convenit imagines conparare. Postremo,
        praeceptoris est docere quemadmodum quaeri quidque conveniat, et unum aliquod aut alterum,
        non omnia quae eius generis erunt exempli causa subicere, quo res possit esse dilucidior; ut
        cum de prooemiis<app n="1"><note>1 prohemiis PIIBC Mx: proemiis C2 E: praemiis
            H.</note></app> quaerendis disputamus, rationem damus quaerendi, non mille

            H.</note></app> genera conscribimus, item arbitramur de imaginibus fieri convenire.
        <milestone unit="section" n="24"/>XXIV. Nunc, ne forte verborum memoriam aut nimis difficilem aut parum utilem arbitrere,
        rerum ipsarum memoria contentus sis, quod et utilior sit et plus habeat facultatis,
        admonendus es quare verborum memoriam non inprobemus. Nam putamus oportere eos qui velint
        res faciliores sine labore et molestia facere in rebus difficilioribus esse ante
        exercitatos. Nec nos hanc verborum memoriam inducimus ut versus </p>


    <pb n="224"/>
    <p> meminisse possimus, sed ut hac exercitatione illa rerum memoria quae pertinet ad utilitatem
        confirmetur, ut ab hac difficili consuetudine sine labore ad <note type="margin" n="40">40</note> illam
        facultatem transire possimus. Sed cum in omni disciplina infirma est artis praeceptio sine
        summa adsiduitate exercitationis, tum vero in mnemonicis<app n="1"><note>1 mnemonicis Aldus:
                nemonicis HP II B Mx: memoriis P2CE.</note></app> minimum valet doctrina, nisi
        industria, studio, labore, diligentia conprobatur. Quam plurimos locos ut habeas et quam
        maxime ad praecepta adcommodatos curare poteris; in imaginibus conlocandis exerceri cotidie
        convenit. Non enim, sicut a ceteris studiis abducimur nonnumquam occupatione, item ab hac re

        hoc est, inquiunt, <note type="margin" n="2">2</note>ostentare se, non ostendere artem. Quare pudor in

        egeat id ipsum confirmatione. Etenim necesse est aut se omnibus anteponant et sua maxime

        tamen essemus laudandi cum talem laborem non fugissemus; nunc sine summo artificio non
        potest fieri. Quis est enim qui, non summe cum tenet artem, possit ea quae iubeat ars de
        tanta et tam diffusa scriptura notare et separare? Ceteri, cum legunt orationes bonas aut
        poemata, probant oratores et poetas, neque intellegunt qua re commoti probent, quod scire
        non possunt ubi sit nec quid sit nec quo modo factum sit id quod eos maxime delectet; at is
        qui et haec omnia intellegit et idonea maxime eligit et omnia in arte maxime scribenda

        quidem nemo potest, sed sine summo artificio <note type="margin" n="7">7</note> multi. Quisquis enim
        audivit de arte paulo plus, in elocutione praesertim, omnia videre poterit quae ex arte
        dicentur; facere nemo poterit nisi eruditus. Ita ut si Ennii de tragoedus velis sententias
        eligere aut de Pacuvianis nuntios, sed quia plane rudis id facere nemo poterit, cum feceris
        te litteratissimum putes, ineptus sis, propterea quod id facile faciat quivis mediocriter
        litteratus; item si, cum de orationibus aut poëmatis elegeris exempla quae certis signis
        artificii notata sunt, quia rudis id nemo facere possit, artificiosissime te fecisse putes,
        erres, propterea quod isto signo videmus te nonnihil scire, aliis signis multa scire

        artificiosius ipsum scribere ex arte. Qui enim scribit artificiose ab aliis commode scripta

        desperarit, in paucis se exercebit; ipsis enim contentus erit, nec mirum, cum ipse
        praeceptor artis omnia penes unum reperire non potuerit. Allatis igitur exemplis a Catone, a
        Graecis, a Laelio, a Scipione, Galba, Porcina, Crasso, Antonio, ceteris, item sumptis aliis

        inutilest ei qui discere vult non putare unum omnia posse. Igitur nemo in hanc incideret
        opinionem si ab uno exempla sumpsissent. Nunc hoc signi est ipsos artis scriptores non
        putasse unum potuisse in omnibus elocutionis partibus enitere, quoniam neque sua protulerunt
        neque unius alicuius aut denique duorum, sed ab omnibus oratoribus et poetis exempla </p>

        Primum omnium, quod ab artis scriptore adfertur exemplum id eius artificii debet esse. Ut si
        quis purpuram aut aliud quippiam vendens dicat: " Sume a me, sed huius exemplum aliunde
        rogabo tibi quod ostendam," sic mercem ipsi qui venditant aliunde exemplum quaeritant

        convenire possint, et post in dicendo, ne possit ars eminere et ab omnibus videri, facultate
        oratoris occultatur. Ergo etiam ut magis ars cognoscatur suis exemplis melius est uti.
        Postremo haec quoque res nos duxit ad hanc rationem, quod nomina rerum Graeca quae
        convertimus, ea remota sunt a consuetudine. Quae enim res apud nostros non erant, earum
        rerum nomina non poterant esse usitata. Ergo haec asperiora primo videantur necesse est, id
        quod fiet rei, non nostra difficultate. Reliquum scripturae consumetur in exemplis; haec
        tamen aliena si posuissemus, factum esset ut quod commodi esset in hoc libro id nostrum non
        esset, quod asperius et inusitatum id proprie nobis adtribueretur. Ergo hanc quoque

        Scipio civitatem servavit." Item: " Tu in forum prodire, tu lucem conspicere, tu in horum
        conspectum venire conaris? Audes verbum facere? audes quicquam ab istis petere? audes
        supplicium deprecari? Quid est quod possis defendere? quid est quod audeas postulare? quid

        non parenti manus adtulisti? non denique in omni dedecore volutatus es?" Haec exornatio cum
        multum venustatis habet tum gravitatis et acrimoniae plurimum; quare videtur esse adhibenda
        et ad ornandam et ad exaugendam orationem. Conversio est per quam non, ut ante, primum
        repetimus verbum, sed ad postremum continenter revertimur, hoc modo: " Poenos populus
        Romanus iustitia vicit, armis vicit, liberalitate vicit." Item: " Ex quo tempore concordia

        Item: " Quem senatus damnarit, quem populus damnarit, quem omnium existimatio damnarit, eum
        vos sententiis vestris absolvatis? " Traductio est quae facit uti, cum idem verbum crebrius

        ut ipse sibi reperiretur inimicus? " Item: " Divitias sine divitis esse. Tu vero virtutem
        praefer divitiis; nam si voles divitias cum virtute conparare, vix satis idoneae tibi

        devolant omnes. Cum enim recessit ea res quae fuit consuetudinis causa, nihil superest quare
        possint in amicitia teneri." Sunt item sententiae quae dupliciter efferuntur. Hoc modo sine

        "Ei non multum potest obesse fortuna qui sibi firmius in virtute quam in casu praesidium
        conlocavit." In contrario hoc modo: " Nam si qui spei non multum conlocarit in casu, quid
        est quod ei magnopere casus obesse possit? " In conclusione hoc pacto: " Quodsi in eos
        plurimum fortuna potest qui suas rationes omnes in casum contulerunt, non sunt omnia
        committenda fortunae, ne magnam nimis in nos habeat dominationem." In his tribus generibus

        nisi sententiam et contrarium et conclusionem frequentibus efferat verbis; sed alias quoque

        constent ex pari fere numero syllabarum. Hoc non denumeratione nostra fiet—nam id quidem
        puerile est—sed tantum adferet usus et exercitatio facultatis, ut animi quodam sensu par
        membrum superiori referre possimus, hoc modo: "In proelio mortem parens oppetebat, domi
        filius nuptias conparabat; haec omina<app n="1"><note>1 omina sugg. Mx: omnia
            MSS.</note></app> gravis casus administrabant." Item: "Alii fortuna dedit felicitatem,
        huic industria virtutem <note type="margin" n="28">28</note> conparavit." In hoc genere saepe fieri
        potest ut non plane par numerus sit syllabarum et tamen esse videatur, si una aut etiam
        altera syllaba est alterum brevius, aut si, cum in altero plures sunt, in altero longior aut
        longiores, plenior aut pleniores syllabae erunt, ut longitudo aut plenitudo harum
        multitudinem alterius adsequatur et exaequet. Similiter cadens exornatio appellatur cum in
        eadem constructione verborum duo aut plura sunt verba quae similiter isdem casibus
        efferantur, hoc modo: " Hominem laudem egentem virtutis, abundantem felicitatis? " Item:
        "Huic omnis in pecunia spes est, a sapientia est animus remotus; diligentia conparat
        divitias, neglegentia corrumpit animum, </p>

    <p> et tamen, cum ita vivit, neminem prae se ducit hominem." Similiter desinens est cum, tametsi
        casus non insunt in verbis, tamen similes exitus sunt, hoc pacto: "Turpiter audes facere,
        nequiter studes dicere; vivis invidiose, delinquis studiose, loqueris odiose." Item: "
        Audaciter territas, humiliter placas." Haec duo genera, quorum alterum in exituum, alterum
        in casus similitudine versatur, inter se vehementer conveniunt; et ea re qui his bene
        utuntur plerumque simul ea conlocant in isdem partibus orationis. Id hoc modo facere
        oportet: " Perditissima ratio est amorem petere, pudorem fugere, diligere formam, neglegere
        famam." Hic et ea verba quae casus habent ad casus similes, et illa quae non habent ad
        similes exitus veniunt. <note type="margin" n="29">29</note> <milestone unit="section" n="21"/>XXI. Adnominatio est cum ad idem verbum et

        ostentat, venit ante quam Romam venit." Et ex contrario: "Hic quos homines alea vincit, eos
        ferro statim vincit." Proditione eiusdem litterae, hoc modo: " Hinc avium dulcedo ducit ad

        adnominationes quae in litterarum brevi commutatione aut productione aut transiectione aut

        non habent tam propinquam in verbis similitudinem et tamen dissimiles non sunt; quibus de
        generibus unum est huiusmodi: " Quid veniam, qui sim, quem<app n="1"><note>1 quem Haase:
                quare veniam quem MSS. Mx.</note></app> insimulem, cui prosim, quae postulem, brevi
        cognoscetis." Nam hic est in quibusdam verbis quaedam similitudo non tam perfecta quam illae
        superiores, sed tamen adhibenda nonnumquam. Alterum genus huiusmodi: " Demus operam,
        Quirites, ne omnino patres conscripti circum-scripti putentur." Haec adnominatio magis
        accedit ad similitudinem quam superior, sed minus quam illae superiores, propterea quod non
        solum additae, sed uno tempore demptae quoque litterae sunt. </p>

    <p> Tertium genus est quod versatur in casuum <note type="margin" n="31">31</note> commutatione aut unius
        aut plurium nominum. Unius nominis, hoc modo: "Alexander Macedo summo labore animum ad

        casuum volutatum est. Plura nomina casibus commutatis hoc modo facient adnominationem: "

        eiusmodi oratione, propterea quod est in his lepos et festivitas, non dignitas neque
        pulcritudo. Quare quae sunt ampla atque pulcra diu placere possunt; quae lepida et concinna

        gravitatis in hac exornatione, propterea quod cum quaesitum est quid oporteat, subicitur id
        non esse factum. Quare facillime fit ut exaugeatur indignitas negotii. Ex eodem genere, ut
        ad nostram quoque personam referamus subiectionem, sic: " Nam quid me facere convenit cum a

        fortitudo est contemptio laboris et periculi cum ratione utilitatis et conpensatione

        gratiam ret-tulerit accipite." Proficit haec aliquantum exornatio ad duas res: nam et quid

        quae tollit id quod dictum est, et pro eo id quod magis idoneum videtur reponit, hoc pacto:
        " Quodsi iste suos hospites rogasset, immo innuisset modo, facile hoc perfici posset." Item:
        " Nam postquam isti vicerunt atque adeo victi sunt—eam quomodo victoriam appellem, quae

        aut non scire aut nolle dicere id quod nunc maxime dicimus, hoc modo: " Nam de pueritia

        nunc consulto relinquo. Et illud praetereo, quod te tribuni rei militaris infrequentem
        tradiderunt. Deinde quod iniuriarum satis fecisti L. Labeoni nihil ad hanc rem pertinere
        puto. Horum nihil dico; revertor ad illud de quo iudicium est." Item: " Non dico te ab
        sociis pecunias cepisse; non sum in eo occupatus quod civitates, regna, domos omnium
        depeculatus es; furta, rapinas omnes tuas omitto." Haec utilis est exornatio si aut ad rem
        quam non pertineat aliis ostendere, quod occulte admonuisse prodest, aut longum est aut
        ignobile, aut planum non potest fieri, aut facile potest reprehendi; ut utilius sit occulte
        fecisse suspicionem quam eiusmodi intendisse orationem quae redarguatur. </p>

    <p> Disiunctum est cum eorum de quibus dicimus aut utrumque aut unum quodque certo concluditur
        verbo, sic: " Populus Romanus Numantiam delevit, Kartaginem sustulit, Corinthum disiecit,
        Fregellas evertit. Nihil Numantinis vires corporis auxiliatae sunt, nihil Kartaginiensibus
        scientia rei militaris adiumento fuit, nihil Corinthiis erudita calliditas praesidii tulit,
        nihil Fregellanis morum et sermonis societas opitulata est." Item: " Formae dignitas aut
        morbo deflorescit aut vetustate extinguitur." Hic utrumque, in superiore exemplo unam
        quamque rem certo verbo concludi videmus. <note type="margin" n="38">38</note> Coniunctio est cum
        interpositione verbi et superiores partes orationis conprehenduntur et in feriores, hoc
        modo: "Formae dignitas aut morbo deflorescit aut vetustate." Adiunctio est cum verbum quo
        res conprehenditur non interponimus, sed aut primum aut postremum conlocamus. Primum, hoc
        pacto: " Deflorescit formae dignitas aut morbo aut vetustate." Postremum, sic: " Aut morbo
        aut vetustate formae dignitas deflorescit." Ad festivitatem disiunctio est apposita, quare
        rarius utemur, ne satietatem pariat; ad brevitatem coniunctio, quare saepius adhibenda est.
        Hae tres exornationes de simplici genere manant. </p>

        commotus? " Item: " Nunc audes etiam venire in horum conspectum, proditor patriae? Proditor,
        inquam, patriae, venire audes in horum conspectum? " Vehementer auditorem commovet eiusdem

        adsumpta circumscribens elocutione, hoc pacto: " Scipionis providentia Kartaginis opes

        Instabilis in istum plurimum fortuna valuit. Omnes invidiose eripuit bene vivendi casus
        facultates." Huiusmodi transiectio, quae rem non reddit obscuram, multum proderit ad

        Superlatio est oratio superans veritatem alicuius augendi minuendive causa. Haec sumitur
        separatim aut cum conparatione. Separatim, sic: " Quodsi concordiam retinebimus in civitate,
        imperii magnitudinem solis ortu aeque occasu metiemur." </p>


    <pb n="340"/>

    <p> Cum conparatione aut a similitudine aut a praestantia superlatio sumitur. A similitudine,
        sic: "Corpore niveum candorem, aspectu igneum ardorem ad-sequebatur." A praestantia, hoc
        modo: " Cuius ore sermo melle dulcior profluebat." Ex eodem genere est hoc: " Tantus erat in

        parte cognoscitur aut de toto pars. De parte totum sic intellegitur: " Non illae te
        nuptiales tibiae eius matrimonii commonebant? " Nam hic omnis sanctimonia nuptiarum uno
        signo tibiarum intellegitur. De toto pars, ut si quis ei qui vestitum aut ornatum sumptuosum

        intellegetur: " Atrox calamitas pectora maerore pulsabat; itaque anhelans ex imis pulmonibus

        oratio magna ", aut " uti pauco sermone." Nam hic facile est intellectu finitima verba rerum

        Permutatio est oratio aliud verbis aliud sententia demonstrans. Ea dividitur in tres partes:

        luporum, cuinam praesidio pecuaria credemus? " Per argumentum tractatur cum a persona aut
        loco aut re aliqua similitudo augendi aut minuendi causa ducitur, ut si quis Drusum Graecum

        poenae sint in civitate hominibus istiusmodi conparatae." Item: "Senatus est officium
        consilio civitatem iuvare; magistratus est officium opera et diligentia consequi senatus
        voluntatem; populi est officium res optimas et homines idoneos maxime suis sententiis

        patieris, ius accusatoris cum iure testimonii commiscebis, testis inprobi cupiditatem

        enim brevi multa, et suum cuique tribuens officium separatim res dividit plures. <note
            type="margin" n="48">48</note> <milestone unit="section" n="36"/>XXXVI. Licentia est cum apud eos quos aut vereri aut metuere debemus
        tamen aliquid pro iure nostro dicimus, quod eos aut quos ii diligunt aliquo in errato vere
        reprehendere videamur, hoc modo: " Miramini, Quirites, quod ab omnibus vestrae rationes
        deserantur? quod causam vestram nemo suscipiat? quod se nemo vestri defensorem profiteatur?
        Adtribuite vestrae culpae, desinite mirari. Quid est enim quare non omnes istam rem fugere
        ac vitare debeant? Recordamini quos habueritis defensores; studia eorum vobis ante oculos
        proponite; deinde exitus omnium considerate. Tum vobis veniat in mentem, ut vere dicam,

    <p> trucidatos esse, inimicos eorum vestris suffragiis in amplissimum locum pervenisse." Item: "
        Nam quid fuit, iudices, quare in sententiis ferendis dubitaveritis aut istum hominem
        nefarium ampliaveritis? Non apertissimae res erant crimini datae? non omnes hae testibus
        conprobatae? non contra tenuiter et nugatorie responsum? Hic vos veriti estis, si primo
        coetu condemnassetis, ne crudeles existimaremini? Dum eam vitatis vituperationem, quae longe

        oscitamini. Luci noctem, nocte lucem expectatis. Aliquid cotidie acerbi atque incommodi
        nuntiatur; et iam eum, cuius opera nobis haec accidunt, vos remoramini diutius et alitis ad

        <milestone unit="section" n="37"/>XXXVII. Eiusmodi licentia si nimium videbitur acrimoniae habere, multis mitigationibus
        lenietur; nam continuo aliquid huiusmodi licebit inferre: " Hic ego virtutem vestram quaero,
        sapientiam desidero, veterem consuetudinem requiro," ut quod erit<app n="1"><note>1 quod
                erit M: ut quod erat E Mx.</note></app> commotum licentia id constituatur laude, ut
        altera res ab iracundia et molestia removeat, altera res ab errato deterreat. Haec res,
        sicut in amicitia </p>




    <pb n="352"/>

    <p> item in dicendo, si loco fit, maxime facit ut et illi qui audient a culpa absint, et nos qui
        dicimus amici ipsorum et veritatis esse videamur. Est autem quoddam genus in dicendo
        licentiae quod astutiore ratione conparatur, cum aut ita obiurgamus eos qui audiunt quomodo
        ipsi se cupiunt obiurgari, aut id quod scimus facile omnes audituros dicimus nos timere
        quomodo accipiant, sed tamen veritate commoveri ut nihilosetius dicamus. Horum amborum
        generum exempla subiciemus; prioris, huiusmodi: " Nimium, Quirites, animis estis simplicibus
        et mansuetis; nimium creditis uni cuique. Existimaris unum quemque eniti ut perficiat quae
        vobis pollicitus sit. Erratis et falsa spe frustra iam diu detinemini stultitia vestra, qui
        quod erat in vestra potestate ab aliis petere quam ipsi sumere maluistis." Posterioris
        licentiae hoc erit exemplum: " Mihi cum isto, iudices, fuit amicitia, sed ista tamen
        amicitia, tametsi vereor quomodo accepturi sitis, tamen dicam, vos me privastis. Quid ita?
        Quia, ut vobis essem probatus, eum qui vos oppugnabat inimicum quam amicum habere malui." </p>

        <note type="margin" n="50">50</note> Ergo haec exornatio cui licentiae nomen est, sicuti demonstravimus,
        duplici ratione tractabitur: acrimonia, quae si nimium fuerit aspera, mitigabitur laude; et
        adsimulatione, de qua posterius diximus, quae non indiget mitigationis, propterea quod
        imitatur licentiam et sua spontest ad animum auditoris adcommodata. <milestone unit="section" n="38"/>XXXVIII. Deminutio est
        cum aliquid inesse in nobis aut in iis quos defendimus aut natura aut fortuna aut industria
        dicemus egregium, quod, ne qua significetur adrogans ostentatio, deminuitur et adtenuatur
        oratione, hoc modo: " Nam hoc pro meo iure, iudices, dico, me labore et industria curasse ut
        disciplinam militarem non in postremis tenerem." Hic si quis dixisset " ut optime tenerem,"
        tametsi vere dixisset, tamen adrogans visus esset. Nunc et ad invidiam vitandam et laudem
        conparandam satis dictum est. Item: " Utrum igitur avaritiae an egestatis<app n="1"><note>1

        Egestatis? Huic quidem pater—nolo nimium dicere—non tenuissimum patrimonium reliquit." Hic

        perspicuam et dilucidam cum gravitate expositionem, hoc modo: " Quodsi istum, iudices,

    <p> Contentio est per quam contraria referentur. Ea est in verborum exornationibus, ut ante

        sententiarum, huiusmodi: "Vos huius incommodis lugetis, iste rei publicae calamitate
        laetatur. Vos vestris fortunis diffiditis, iste solus suis eo magis confidit." Inter haec

        Similitudo est oratio traducens ad rem quampiam aliquid ex re dispari simile. Ea sumitur aut

        de causis sumitur, item quattuor modis dicitur: per contrarium, per negationcm, per

        singulos modos pronuntiandi. <milestone unit="section" n="46"/>XLVI. Ornandi causa sumitur per contrarium sic: " Non enim,
        quemadmodum in palaestra qui taedas candentes accipit celerior est in cursu continuo quam
        ille qui tradit, item melior imperator novus qui accipit exercitum quam ille qui decedit;

    <p> plane et perspicue et probabiliter dici potuit, hoc modo: " Dicitur minus bonos imperatores
        a melioribus exercitus accipere solere "; sed ornandi causa simile sumptum est, ut orationi
        quaedam dignitas conparetur. Dictum autem est per contrarium. Nam tum similitudo sumitur per
        contrarium cum ei rei quam nos probamus aliquam rem negamus esse similem. Per negationem
        dicetur probandi causa hoc modo: " Neque equus indomitus, quamvis bene natura conpositus
        sit, idoneus potest esse ad eas utilitates quae desiderantur ab equo; neque homo indoctus,
        quamvis sit ingeniosus, ad virtutem potest pervenire." Hoc probabilius factum est quod magis
        est veri simile non posse virtutem sine doctrina conparari, quoniam ne<app n="1"><note>1 ne

        sumptum est probandi causa, dictum autem per negationem; id enim perspicuum est de primo
        similitudinis verbo. <note type="margin" n="60">60</note> <milestone unit="section" n="47"/>XLVII. Sumetur et apertius dicendi causa
        simile— dicitur per brevitatem—hoc modo: " In amicitia gerenda, sicut in certamine currendi,
        non ita convenit exerceri ut quoad necesse sit venire possis, sed ut productus studio et
        viribus ultra facile procurras." Nam hoc simile est ut apertius intellegatur mala ratione

    <p> post mortem amici liberos eius custodiant; propterea quod in cursore tantum velocitatis esse
        oporteat ut efferatur ultra finem, in amico tantum benivolentiae ut ultra quam quod amicus
        sentire possit procurrat amicitiae studio. Dictum autem simile est per brevitatem, non enim
        ita ut in ceteris rebus res ab re separata est, sed utraeque res coniuncte et confuse
        pronuntiatae. Ante oculos ponendi negotii causa sumetur similitudo—dicetur per
        conlationem—sic: " Uti citharoedus cum prodierit optime vestitus, palla inaurata

        specie sit et statura adposita ad dignitatem, si, cum magnam populo commorit iis rebus
        expectationem, repente, silentio facto, vocem mittat acerbissimam cum turpissimo corporis
        motu, quo melius ornatus et magis fuerit expectatus, eo magis derisus et contemptus eicitur;
        item si quis in excelso loco et in magnis ac locupletibus copiis conlocatus fortunae
        muneribus et naturae commodis omnibus abundabit, si virtutis et artium quae virtutis
        magistrae sunt egebit, quo magis ceteris rebus erit copiosus et inlustris et expectatus, eo
        vehementius derisus et contemptus ex omni conventu bonorum eicietur." Hoc simile exornatione
        utriusque rei, alterius inertiae </p>



    <pb n="382"/>

    <p> alterius stultitiae simili ratione conlata, sub aspectus omnium rem subiecit. Dictum autem

        pulsae recedunt, ..." Ex eadem similitudine nunc per translationem verba sumimus: " item
        falsi amici sereno vitae tempore praesto sunt; simul atque hiemem fortunae viderunt,
        devolant omnes." Sed inventio similium facilis erit si quis sibi omnes res, animantes et
        inanimas, mutas et eloquentes, feras et mansuetas, terrestres, caelestes, maritimas,
        artificio, casu, natura conparatas, usitatas atque inusitatas, frequenter ponere ante oculos
        poterit, et ex his aliquam venari similitudinem quae aut ornare aut docere aut apertiorem
        rem facere aut ponere ante oculos possit. Non enim res tota totae rei necesse est similis
        sit, sed id ipsum quod conferetur similitudinem habeat oportet. <note type="margin" n="62">62</note>

    <p> Puto in hoc exemplo datos esse uni cuique sermones ad dignitatem adcommodatos; id quod
        oportet in hoc genere conservare. Sunt item sermocinationes consequentes, hoc genus: " Nam
        quid putamus illos dicturos si hoc iudicaritis? Nonne omnes hac utentur oratione? "—deinde

        persona confingitur quasi adsit, aut cum res muta aut informis fit eloquens, et forma ei et
        oratio adtribuitur ad dignitatem adcommodata aut actio quaedam, hoc pacto: " Quodsi nunc
        haec urbs invictissima vocem mittat, non hoc pacto loquatur: ' Ego illa plurimis

        commiseratione. <note type="margin" n="67">67</note> Significatio est res quae plus in suspicione

        augendae suspicionis causa, sic: Hic de tanto patrimonio tam cito testam qui sibi petat
        ignem non reliquit." Per ambiguum, cum verbum potest in duas pluresve sententias accipi, sed
        accipitur tamen in eam partem quam vult is qui dixit; ut de eo si dicas qui multas
        hereditates adierit: "Prospice tu, qui plurimum cernis." <milestone unit="section" n="54"/>LIV. Ambigua quemadmodum vitanda
        sunt quae obscuram reddunt orationem, item haec consequenda quae confidunt huiusmodi

        ancipites aut multiplices potestates. </p>


    <pb n="402"/>

    <p> Per consequentiam significatio fit cum res quae sequantur aliquam rem dicuntur, ex quibus
        tota res relinquitur in suspicione; ut si salsamentarii filio dicas: " Quiesce tu, cuius

        abscisionem, si, cum incipimus aliquid dicere, deinde praecidamus, et ex eo quod iam diximus
        satis relinquitur suspicionis, sic: " Qui ista forma et aetate nuper alienae domi—nolo plura
        dicere." Per similitudinem, cum aliqua re simili allata nihil amplius dicimus, sed ex ea
        significamus quid sentiamus, hoc modo: " Noli, Saturnine, nimium populi frequentia fretus
        esse; inulti iacent Graeci." Haec exornatio plurimum festivitatis habet interdum et

    <p> [MARCUS TULLIUS CICERO] TO GAIUS HERENNIUS ON THE THEORY OF PUBLIC SPEAKING BOOK I <note
            type="margin" n="1">1</note> <milestone unit="section" n="1"/>I. My private affairs keep me so busy that I can hardly find enough
        leisure to devote to study, and the little that is vouchsafed to me I have usually preferred
        to spend on philosophy. Yet your desire, Gaius Herennius, has spurred me to compose a work
        on the Theory of Public Speaking, lest you should suppose that in a matter which concerns
        you I either lacked the will or shirked the labour. And I have undertaken this project the
        more gladly because I knew that you had good grounds in wishing to learn rhetoric, for it is
        true that copiousness and facility in expression bear abundant fruit, if controlled by
        proper knowledge and a strict discipline of the mind. That is why I have omitted to treat
        those topics which, for the sake of futile self-assertion, Greek writers <note
            type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a The beginning of Book 4 further sets forth the
            author's attitude to the Greek writers on rhetoric (who these are specifically is
            uncertain); cf, also 3. xxiii. 38. For his attitude to philosophical studies see the end
            of Book 4.</note> have adopted. For they, from fear of appearing to know too little,
        have gone in quest of notions irrelevant to the art, in order that the art might seem more
        difficult to understand. I, on the other hand, have treated those topics which seemed </p>

    <pb n="5"/>
    <p> pertinent to the theory of public speaking. I have not been moved by hope of gain <note

        the rest have been, in undertaking to write, but have done so in order that, by my
        painstaking work, I may gratify your wish. To avoid prolixity, I shall now begin my
        discussion of the subject, as soon as I have given you this one injunction: Theory without
        continuous practice in speaking is of little avail: from this you may understand that the
        precepts of theory here offered ought to be applied in practice. <note type="margin" n="2">2</note> <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>II.
        The task of the public speaker is to discuss capably those matters which law and custom have
        fixed for the uses of citizenship, and to secure as far as possible the agreement of his
        hearers. <note type="footnote" n="b" place="opposite">b The definition is that of
            Hermagoras, to whom the function (ἔργον) of the perfect orator is τὸ τεθὲν πολιτικὸν
            ζήτημα διατίθεσθαι κατὰ τὸ ἐνδεχόμενον πειστικῶς. See Sextus Empiricus, Adv. Rhet. 62,
            ed. Fabricius, 2. 150. Cf. Cicero, De Inv. 1. v. 6.</note> There are three kinds <note
            type="footnote" n="c" place="opposite">c γένη.</note> of causes which the speaker must

            >d ἐπιδεικτικόν, συμβουλευτικόν, δικανικόν . The scheme is Aristotelian (Rhel. 1. 3 .
            1358b) but in essence older. The<pb n="5"/> author's emphasis in the first two books, on
            the judicial kind, is characteristically Hellenistic (e.g., Hermagorean). The better
            tradition indicates that originally rhetoric was concerned with the judicial kind, and
            was later extended to the other two fields. For a study of the three genera see D. A. G.
            Hinks, Class. Quarterly 30 (1936). 170-6 Cf. Cicero, De Inv. l. v. 7.</note> The
        epideictic kind is devoted to the praise or censure of some particular person. The
        deliberative consists in the discussion of policy and embraces persuasion and
            dissuasion.<note type="footnote" n="e">e προτροπή and ἀποτροπή.</note> The judicial is
        based on legal controversy, and comprises criminal prosecution or civil suit, and

        explain what faculties the speaker should possess, and then show the proper means of

    <p>
        <note type="margin" n="3">3</note> The speaker, then, should possess the faculties of Invention,
        Arrangement, Style, Memory, and Delivery.<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a
            εὕρεσις, τάξις or οἰκονομία, λέξις or ἑρμηνεία or Φράσις, μνήμη, ὑπόκρισις. The
            pre-Aristotelian rhetoric, represented by the Rhet. ad Alexandrum, treated the first
            three (without classifying them); Aristotle would add Delivery (Rhet. 3. 1, 1403 b), and
            his pupil Theophrastus did so (see note on 3. xi. 19 below). When precisely in the
            Hellenistic period Memory was added as a fifth division by the Rhodian or the Pergamene
            school, we do not know. These faculties (res; see also 1. ii. 3) are referred to in 2.
            i. 1 below (cf. 1. iii. 4) as the speaker's functions (officia =ἔργα τοῦ ῥήτορος).
            Quintilian, 3. 3. 11 ff., considers them as departments or constituent elements of the
            art (partes rhetorices) rather than as opera (= officia); so also here at 3. i. 1, 3.
            viii. 15, 3. xvi. 28, and Cicero, De Inv. 1. vii. 9. ἔργον is an Aristotelian concept
            (cf, the definition of rhetoric in Rhet. 1. 1-2, 1355b), and Aristotle was the first to
            classify the (major) functions. Our author here gives the usual order of the divisions;
            so also Cicero, De Oratore 1. 31. 142. Diogenes Laertius, 7. 43, presents the Stoic
            scheme: Invention, Style (Φράσις), Arrangement, and Delivery. A goodly number of
            rhetorical systems were actually based on these ἔργα (e.g., in most part Cicero's and
            Quintilian's); others were based on the divisions of the discourse (μόρια λόγου). See K.
            Barwick, Hermes 57 (1922). .1 ff.; Friedrich Solmsen, Amer. Journ. Philol. 62 (1941).
            35-50, 169-90. Our author conflates the two schemes he has in-<pb n="7"/> herited; see
            especially 1. ii. 3—iii. 4, 2. i. 1—ii. 2, and the Introduction to the present volume,
            p. xviii.</note> Invention is the devising of matter, true or plausible, that would make
        the case convincing.<note type="footnote" n="b">b The concept goes back at least as far as
            Plato (e.g., Phaedrus 236 A); see Aristotle, Rhet. 1. 2 (1355b), on finding artistic
            proofs.</note> Arrangement is the ordering and distribution of the matter, making clear
        the place to which each thing is to be assigned. Style is the adaptation of suitable words
        and sentences to the matter devised. Memory is the firm retention in the mind of the matter,
        words, and arrangement. Delivery is the graceful regulation of voice, countenance, and
        gesture. All these faculties we can acquire by three means: Theory, Imitation, and
            Practice.<note type="footnote" n="c">c τέχνη (also παιδεία, ἐπιστήμη, μάθησις, scientia,
            doctrina), μίμησις, γυμνασία (also ἄσκησις, μελέτη, ἐμπειρία, συνήθεια, declamatio). The
            usual triad, Nature (Φύσις, natura, ingenium, facultas), Theory, and Practice, can be
            traced back to Protagoras. Plato (Phaedrus 269 D), and Isocrates (e.g., Antid. 187; Adv.
            Soph. 14-18, where Imitation is also included). Cf. also Aristotle in Diogenes Laertius
            5. 18; Cicero, De Inv. 1. i. 2. De Oratore 1. 4. 14; Dionysius Halic. in Syrianus.
            Scholia Ηermog., ed. Rabe, 1. 4-5: Tacitus, Dialog, de Orator., ch. 33; Plutarch, De
            liberis educ. 4 (2 A); and see Paul Shorey, Trans. Am. Philol. Assn. 40 (1909). 185-201.
            Imitation is presumed to have been emphasized in the Pergamene school of rhetors under
            Stoic influence. Quintilian, 3. 5. 1, tells us that it was classed by some writers as a
            fourth element, which he yet subordinates to Theory. On Imitation cf. Antonius in
            Cicero, De Oratore 2. 21. 89 ff.; Dionysius Halic, De Imitat. (Opuscula 2. 197-217, ed.
            Usener-Rader-macher); Quintilian, 10. 1. 20 ff.; Eduard Stemplinger, Das Plagiat in der

            Imitation: Theory and Practice in Roman Rhetoric," Quart. Journ. Speech 37, 1 (1951).
            11-22. " Exercise " refers to the progymnasmata, of which our treatise and Cicero's De
            Inv. show the first traces in Latin rhetoric, and to the “ suasoriae ” (deliberationes)
            and “ controversiae ” (causae) in which the treatise abounds. See also 4. xliv. 58
            (Refining). The divorce between praeexercitamenta and exercitationes belongs to the
            Augustan period.</note> By theory is meant </p>

    <pb n="9"/>
    <p> a set of rules that provide a definite method and system of speaking. Imitation stimulates
        us to attain, in accordance with a studied method, the effectiveness of certain models in
        speaking. Practice is assiduous exercise and experience in speaking. Since, then, I have
        shown what causes the speaker should treat and what kinds of competence he should possess,
        it seems that I now need to indicate how the speech can be adapted to the theory of the
        speaker's function. <note type="margin" n="4">4</note> <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>III. Invention is used for the six parts of a
        discourse: the Introduction, Statement of Facts, Division, Proof, Refutation, and
            Conclusion.<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a The author's treatment of the
            parts of a discourse differs from that of Aristotle, who, in Rhet. 3. 13 (1414 a) ff.,
            discusses them—Proem, Statement of Facts, Proof, and Conclusion—with all three kinds of
            oratory in view, not only the judicial, under Arrangement. Note that Invention is
                applied<pb n="9"/> concretely to the parts of the discourse; in 1. xi. 18 ff. below
            the Issues are subjoined to Proof and Refutation. Cf. Cicero, De Inc. 1. xiv. 19. The
            Stoic scheme included Proem, Statement of Facts. Replies to Opponents, and Conclusion
            (Diogenes Laertius 7. 43).</note> The Introduction is the beginning of the discourse,
        and by it the hearer's mind is prepared <note type="footnote" n="b">b παρασκευάζεται. The

            Anon..in Rabe, Proleg. Sylloge, p. 62.</note> for attention. The Narration or Statement

            170), Theon 4 (Spengel 2. 78). Cf. Cicero, De Inv. 1. xix. 27.</note> By means of the
        Division we make clear what matters are agreed upon and what are contested, and announce
        what points we intend to take up. Proof is the presentation of our arguments, together with
        their corroboration.<note type="footnote" n="d">d Cf. Cicero, De Inv. 1. xxiv. 34.</note>

            Inv. 1. xlii. 78 (reprehensio).</note> The Conclusion is the end of the discourse,
        formed in accordance with the principles of the art. Along with the speaker's functions, in
        order to make the subject easier to understand, I have been led also to discuss the parts of
        a discourse, and to adapt these to the theory of Invention. It seems, then, that I must at
        this juncture first discuss the Introduction.<note type="footnote" n="b" place="opposite">b
            πρόλογος, probably.</note>
        <note type="margin" n="5">5</note> Given the cause, in order to be able to make a more appropriate
        Introduction, we must consider what kind of cause it is. The kinds of causes are four:
        honourable, discreditable, doubtful, and petty.<note type="footnote" n="c" place="opposite"
            >c ἔνδοξον, παράδοξον, ἀμφίδοξον, ἄδοξον, the σχήματα ὑποθέσεων, later sometimes called
            figurae materiarum or controvers iarum. The classification is on a moral basis. These
            genera causarum are not to be confused with the three genera causarum treated in 1. ii.
            2 above. Most rhetoricians (e.g., Cicero. De Inv. 1. xv. 20) treated also a fifth kind,
            obscurum (δυσπαρακολούθητον), and some included six kinds (see Quintilian, 4. 1. 40).
            The division into four σχήματα is Hermagorean (cf. Augustine, De Rhet. 1. 17 ff., in
            Halm, pp. 147 ff.), and<pb n="11"/> here our author conflates Hermagorean doctrine with
            the pre-Aristotelian doctrine of the Proem; see Georg Thiele, Hermagoras, Strassburg,
            1893, pp. 113-121.</note> A cause is regarded as of the honourable kind when we either
        defend what seems to deserve defence by all men, or attack what all men seem in duty bound
        to attack; for example, when we defend a hero, or prosecute a parricide. A cause is
        understood to be of the discreditable kind when something honourable is under attack or when
        something discreditable is being defended. A cause is of the doubtful kind when it is partly
        honourable and partly discreditable. A cause is of the petty kind when the matter brought up
        is considered unimportant. <note type="margin" n="6">6</note> <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>IV. In view of these considerations, it
        will be in point to apply the theory of Introductions to the kind of cause. There are two
        kinds of Introduction: the Direct Opening, in Greek called the Prooimion,<note
            type="footnote" n="d">d προοίμιον, "Prelude"; see Aristotle, Rhet. 3. 14 (1414b),
            Quintilian, 4. 1. 2 ff., Anon. Seg. 4, in Spengel-Hammer 1 (2). 352-3. Cf. Cicero. De
            Inv. 1. xv. 20.</note>
    </p>

    <pb n="13"/>
    <p> and the Subtle Approach, called the Ephodos.<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a
            ἔφοδος. The term is used in Oxyr. Pap. 3. 27, in a rhetorical treatise of perhaps the
            beginning of the fourth century B.C. In Ιsaeus 3, Dionysius Halic. comments on Isaeus'
            use of ἔφοδοι. Cf. also Anon., in Rabe, Proleg. Syll., p. 206, and Anon., Proleg.
            Invent., in Walz 7 (1). 54.</note> The Direct Opening straightway prepares the hearer to
        attend to our speech. Its purpose is to enable us to have hearers who are attentive,
        receptive, and well-disposed.<note type="footnote" n="b" place="opposite">b The hearer is to
            be rendered προδεκτικός, εὐμαθής, εὔνους. Cf. Cicero, De Inv. 1. xvi. 22-3. The doctrine
            is pre-Aristotelian; see, e.g., Rhet. ad Alex., ch. 29 (1436a), and Epist. Socrat. 30. 4
            on Isocrates. Aristotle, Rhet. 3. 14 (1415a), includes Receptiveness under Attention.
            Cicero, Part. Orat. 8. 28, gives three aims for the Direct Opening: ut amice, ut<pb
                n="13"/> intellegenter, ut attente audiamur. For the importance of Attention in
            present-day rhetoric, cf. J. A. Winans, Public Speaking, New York, 1917, p. 194: "
            Persuasion is the process of inducing others to give fair, favourable, or undivided
            attention to propositions."</note> If our cause is of the doubtful kind, we shall build
        the Direct Opening upon goodwill, so that the discreditable part of the cause cannot be
        prejudicial to us. If our cause is of the petty kind, we shall make our hearers attentive.
        If our cause is of the discreditable kind, unless we have hit upon a means of capturing
        goodwill by attacking our adversaries, we must use the Subtle Approach, which I shall
        discuss later.<note type="footnote" n="c">c 1. vi. 9 ff.</note> And finally, if our cause is
        of the honourable kind, it will be correct either to use the Direct Opening or not to use
            it.<note type="footnote" n="d">d Cf. Rhet. ad Alix., ch. 29 (1437b): " If there is no
            prejudice against ourselves or our speech or our subject, we shall set forth our
            Proposition immediately at the beginning, appealing for attention and a benevolent
            hearing afterwards."</note> If we wish to use it, we must show why the cause is
        honourable, or else briefly announce what matters we are going to discuss. But if we do not
        wish to use the Direct Opening, we must begin our speech with a law, a written document, or
        some argument supporting our cause. <note type="margin" n="7">7</note> Since, then, we wish to have our
        hearer receptive, well-disposed, and attentive, I shall disclose how each state can be
        brought about. We can have receptive hearers if we briefly summarise the cause and make </p>

    <pb n="15"/>
    <p> them attentive; for the receptive hearer is one who is willing to listen attentively. We
        shall have attentive hearers by promising to discuss important, new, and unusual matters, or
        such as appertain to the commonwealth, or to the hearers themselves, or to the worship of
        the immortal gods; by bidding them listen attentively; and by enumerating the points <note
            type="margin" n="8">8</note> we are going to discuss. We can by four methods make our hearers
        well-disposed: by discussing our own person, the person of our adversaries, that of our
        hearers, and the facts themselves.<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a So

                the<pb n="15"/> author accords with the early Greek rhetoric based on the divisions
            of the discourse. Nowhere does he make a profound analytical study of the emotions such

            anger, fear, hate, and desire.</note> and pleading for our hearers' aid, and at the same
        time showing that we have been unwilling to place our hope in anyone else. From the

        violent behaviour, their dominance, factiousness, wealth, lack of self-restraint, high
        birth, clients, hospitality, club allegiance, or marriage alliances:, and by making clear
        that they rely more upon these supports than upon the truth. We shall bring our adversaries
        into contempt by presenting their idleness, cowardice, sloth, and luxurious habits. From the
        discussion of the person of our hearers goodwill is secured if we set forth the courage,
        wisdom, humanity, and nobility of past judgements they have rendered, and if we reveal what
        esteem they enjoy and with what interest their decision is awaited. From the discussion of
        the facts themselves we shall render the hearer well-disposed by extolling our own cause
        with praise and by contemptuously disparaging that of our adversaries. <note type="margin" n="9"

            place="opposite">a In Cicero, De Inv. 1. xvii. 23, the Subtle Approach is specifically
            used in the admirabile genus causae. The three causae of Cicero correspond to the "
            occasions " classified by our author. Anon. Seg. 21 ff. (Spengel-Hammer 1 [2]. 357 ff.)
            gives four occasions on which the Prooemion should be dispensed with, and discusses the
            view that it must always be used.</note> There are three occasions on which we cannot
        use the Direct Opening, and these we must consider carefully: (1) when our cause is
        discreditable, that is. when the subject itself alienates the hearer from us; (2) when the
        hearer has apparently been won over by the previous .speakers of the opposition; (3) or when
        the hearer has become wearied by listening to the previous speakers. If the cause has a
        discreditable character,<note type="footnote" n="b">b Cf. Cicero, De Inx. 1. xvii. 24</note>
        we can make our Introduction with the following points: that the agent, not the action,
        ought to be considered: that we ourselves are displeased with the acts which our opponents
        say have been committed, and that </p>

    <pb n="19"/>
    <p> these are unworthy, yes, heinous. Next, when we have for a time enlarged upon this idea, we
        shall show that nothing of the kind has been committed by us. Or we shall set forth the
        judgement rendered by others in an analogous cause, whether that cause be of equal, or less,
        or greater importance; then we shall gradually approach our own cause and establish the
        analogy. The same result is achieved if we deny an intention to discuss our opponents or
        some extraneous matter and yet, by subtly inserting the words,<note type="footnote" n="a"
            place="opposite">a παραφθέγγεσθαι.</note> do so. <note type="margin" n="10">10</note> If the hearers
        have been convinced,<note type="footnote" n="b" place="opposite">b Cf. Cicero, De Inv. 1.
            xvii. 25.</note> if our opponent's speech has gained their credence—and this will not be
        hard for us to know, since we are well aware of the means by which belief is ordinarily
        effected—if, then, we think belief has been effected, we shall make our Subtle Approach to
        the cause by the following means: the point which our adversaries have regarded as their
        strongest support we shall promise to discuss first; we shall begin with a statement made by
        the opponent, and particularly with that which he has made last; and we shall use
            Indecision,<note type="footnote" n="c" place="opposite">c See 4. xxix. 40 below.</note>
        along with an exclamation of astonishment: " What had I best say? " or " To what point shall
        1 first reply? " If the hearers have been fatigued by listening, we shall open with
        something that may provoke laughter<note type="footnote" n="d" place="opposite">d Note that
            humour enters the rhetorical system under the Introduction. Aristotle, Rhet. 3. 14
            (1415a), also discusses the place of laughter in the Proem. This classification of
            eighteen means of provoking laughter must have been a recent accession to rhetorical
            theory; cf. the summary in Cicero, De Oratore 2. 61. 248 ff. On wit and humour in

            type="margin" n="11">11</note> <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>VII. Between the Subtle Approach and the Direct Opening there is the
        following difference. The Direct Opening should be such that by the straightforward methods
        I have prescribed we immediately make the hearer well-disposed or attentive or receptive;
        whereas the Subtle Approach should be such that we effect all these results covertly,
        through dissimulation,<note type="footnote" n="c" place="opposite">c λαθραίως δι᾿ ἑτέρων
            λόγων. Anon., Proleg. Invent., in Walz 7(1). 54. 14-16, gives the same precept.</note>
        and so can arrive at the same vantage-point in the task of speaking. But though this
        three-fold advantage—that the hearers constantly show themselves attentive, receptive, and
        well-disposed to us—is to be secured throughout the discourse, it must in the main be won by
        the Introduction to the cause. Now, for fear that we may at some time use a faulty
        Introduction. I shall show what faults must be avoided. In the Introduction of a cause we
        must make sure that our style is temperate and that the words are in current use,<note
            type="footnote" n="d">d Anon. Seg. 19 (Spengel-Hammer 1[2]. 356) makes the same
            point.</note> so that the discourse seems unprepared. An Introduction is faulty if it
        can be applied as well to a number of causes;<note type="footnote" n="e">e Cf. Cicero, De
            Inv. 1. xviii. 26.</note> that is called a banal Introduction. Again, an Introduction
        which the adversary can use no less well is faulty, and that </p>

    <pb n="23"/>
    <p> is called a common Introduction. That Introduction, again, is faulty which the opponent can
        turn to his own use against you. And again that is faulty which has been composed in too
        laboured a style, or is too long; and that which does not appear to have grown out of the
        cause itself in such a way as to have an intimate connection with the Statement of Facts;
        and, finally, that which fails to make the hearer well-disposed or receptive or attentive.
        <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>VIII. Concerning the Introduction I have said enough; next let me turn to the Narration or
        Statement <note type="margin" n="12">12</note> of Facts. There are three types of Statement of
            Facts.<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a διήγησις. Cf. Cicero, De Inv. 1.
            xix. 27.</note> It is one type when we set forth the facts and turn every detail to our
        advantage so as to win the victory, and this kind appertains to the causes on which a
        decision is to be rendered.<note type="footnote" n="b" place="opposite">b διηγήσεις ἐπὶ
            κριτῶν λεγόμεναι</note> There is a second type which often enters into a speech as a
        means of winning belief or incriminating our adversary<note type="footnote" n="c"
            place="opposite">c διαβολή.</note> or effecting a transition or setting the stage for
            something.<note type="footnote" n="d" place="opposite">d Incidental Narrative
            (παραδιήγησις); cf. Quintilian, 9. 2. 107, and Anon. Seg. 61 (Spengel-Hammer 1 [2].
            364-5), who distinguishes it from Digression (παρέκβασις).</note> The third type<note
            type="footnote" n="e">e διηγήσεις καθ᾿ ἑαυτάς.</note> is not used in a cause actually
        pleaded in court, yet affords us convenient practice<note type="footnote" n="f">f The
            reference is to the progymnasmata (praeexercitamenta). Narratio provided the first
            exercises imposed by the rhetor; see Quintilian, 2. 4. 1, and Jean Cousin, Études sur
            Quintilien, Paris, 1936, 1. 113.</note> for handling the first two types more <note
            type="margin" n="13">13</note> advantageously in actual causes. Of such narratives there are two
        kinds: one based on the facts, the other on the persons.<note type="footnote" n="g">g
            According to τὰ πράγματα or τὰ πρόσωπα.</note> The kind of narrative based on the
        exposition of the facts presents three forms: legendary, historical, and realistic. The

            the things that actually have happened, but the kind of things that might well
            happen—that are possible in the sense of being either probable or inevitable." But it is
            doubtless the miraculous element in tragedies that is here in mind; see the example of

        should have three qualities: brevity, clarity, and plausibility.<note type="footnote" n="g"
            >g συντομία, σαφήνεεια, πιθανότης. The precept is Isocratean (see Quintilian, 4. 2.
            31-2) or even older (see Octave Navarre, Essai sur la rhétorique grecque avant Arislote,
            Paris, 1900, p. 246). Aristotle, Rhet. 3. 10 (1416 b), scorns the injunction of brevity
            in favour of the " proper mean." Cf. Cicero, De Inv. 1. xx. 28.</note> Since we know
        that these qualities are essential, we must learn how to achieve them. We shall be able to
        make the Statement of Facts brief if we begin it at the place at which we need to begin; if
        we do not try to recount from the remotest beginning; if our Statement of Facts is summary
        and </p>

    <pb n="27"/>
    <p> not detailed;<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a Presented κεφαλαιωδῶς, not
            μερικῶς.</note> if we carry it forward, not to the furthermost point, but to the point
        to which we need to go; if we use no digressions and do not wander from the account we have
        undertaken to set forth; and if we present the outcome in such a way that the facts that
        have preceded can also be known, although we have not spoken of them. For example, if I
        should say that I have returned from the province, it would also be understood that I had
        gone to the province.<note type="footnote" n="b" place="opposite">b Doxapatres (eleventh
            century), in Walz 2. 230, gives the same example; it is doubtless Greek in
            origin.</note> And in general it is better to pass by not only that which weakens the
        cause but also that which neither weakens nor helps it. Furthermore, we must guard against
        saying a thing more than once, and certainly against repeating immediately what we have said
        already, as in the following: " Simo came from Athens to Megara in the evening; when he came
        to Megara, he laid a trap for the maiden: after laying the trap he ravished her then and
            there."<note type="footnote" n="c" place="opposite">c The author of these iambic

        <note type="margin" n="15">15</note> Our Statement of Facts will be clear<note type="footnote" n="d">d
            Cf. Cicero, De Inv. 1. xx. 29.</note> if we set forth the facts in the precise order in

        must see that our language is not confused<note type="footnote" n="e">e ὑπερβατῶς, in
            inverted order.</note> involved, or unfamiliar, that we do not shift to another subject,
        that we do not trace the affair back to its remotest beginning, nor carry it too far
        forward, and that we do not omit anything pertinent. And our Statement of Facts will be
        clear if we follow' the precepts on brevity that I have laid down,<note type="footnote"
            n="f">f in 1. ix. 14 above.</note> for the shorter the Statement of Facts, the clearer
        will it be and the easier to follow. </p>

    <pb n="29"/>
    <p>
        <note type="margin" n="16">16</note> Our Statement of Facts will have plausibility<note type="footnote"
            n="a" place="opposite">a Cf. Cicero, De Inv. 1. xxi. 29-30.</note> if it answers the
        requirements of the usual, the expected, and the natural; if account is strictly kept of the
        length of time, the standing of the persons involved, the motives in the planning, and the
        advantages offered by the scene of action, so as to obviate the argument in refutation that
        the time was too short, or that there was no motive, or that the place was unsuitable, or
        that the persons themselves could not have acted or been treated so. If the matter is true,
        all these precautions must none the less be observed in the Statement of Facts, for often
        the truth cannot gain credence otherwise. And if the matter is fictitious, these measures
        will have to be observed all the more scrupulously. Fabrication must be circumspect in those
        matters in which official documents or some person's unimpeachable guaranty will prove to
        have played a role. In what I have thus far said I believe that I agree with the other
        writers on the art of rhetoric except for the innovations I have devised on Introductions by
        the Subtle Approach. I alone,<note type="footnote" n="b" place="opposite">b See note on 1.

            study of the meaning of status and of constitutio see A. O. L. Dieter, Speech Monographs
            17, 4 (1950). 345-69. Our author makes use of the status system only for judicial
            oratory, the examples being drawn from both criminal and civil causes. Adumbrated in
            pre-Aristotelian rhetoric (where it was close to Attic procedure), as well as in
            Aristotle's Rhetoric, it was developed principally by Hermagoras. Stoic and Aristotelian
            dialectic exerted an influence in its evolution. The terminology and Roman examples show
            that our author assimilated the Greek theory. His system differs considerably from that
            of Hermagoras; see Kroehnert, pp. 21 ff.;<pb n="33"/> Hermann Netzker, Herrnagoras,

            Quintilian, 3. 6. 1 ff. Most critics see our author as a follower of Marcus Antonius in
            his system of status; cf. Quintilian, 3. 6. 45 ff. (note that legalis, not legitimus is
            the term used for the " Legal " Issue by the followers of Antonius), and Kroehnert, loc.
            cit. Modern students of Roman Law for the most part think that from the juristic point
            of view, as against the rhetorical, the status system was over-intricate and
            impractical; see note on 2. xiii. 19 below.</note> which the cause presents. Others make

        when making his son his heir, in his will bequeathed silver vessels to his wife: " Let my
        heir give my wife thirty pounds' weight of silver vessels, ' such as shall be selected '."

        <note type="margin" n="21">21</note> A cause rests on Definition when the name by which an act should be
        called is in controversy. The following is an example: When Lucius Saturninus was about to
        introduce the grain law concerning the five-sixths as, Quintus Caepio, who was city quaestor
        during that time, explained to the Senate that the treasury could not endure so great a
        largess. The Senate decreed that if Saturninus should propose that law before the people he
        would appear to be doing so against the common weal. Saturninus proceeded with his motion.
        His colleagues interposed a veto; nevertheless he brought the lot-urn down for the vote.
        Caepio, when he sees Saturninus presenting his motion against the public welfare despite his
        colleagues' veto, attacks him with the assistance of some Conservatives, destroys the

            Probably in his second tribunate in 100 B.C, L. Appuleius Saturninus proposed his law
            fixing the fee for grain at five-sixths of an as (for a modius); the lex Sempronia
            frumentaria of 123 had set the price at almost eight times that amount. It is uncertain
            whether the bill passed. Caepio was in 99 B.C charged with treason, but was acquitted.

    <pb n="45"/>
    <p> It is an Absolute Issue when we contend that the act in and of itself, without our drawing
        on any extraneous considerations, was right. For example, a certain mime abused the poet
        Accius by name on the stage. Accius sues him on the ground of injuries. The player makes no
        defence except to maintain that it was permissible to name a person under whose name
        dramatic works were given to be performed on the stage.<note type="footnote" n="a"

        <note type="margin" n="25">25</note> <milestone unit="section" n="15"/>XV. A cause rests on the Shifting of the Question of Guilt when we
        do not deny our act but plead that we were driven to it by the crimes of others, as in the

        cause rests on the Rejection of the Responsibility when we repudiate, not the act charged,
        but the responsibility, and either transfer it to another person or attribute it to some
        circumstance. An example of the transference of responsibility to another person: if an
        accusation should be brought against the confessed slayer of Publius Sulpicius, and he
        should defend his act by invoking an order of the consuls, declaring that they not only
        commanded the </p>

            Sulpicius Rufus was among those proscribed by Sulla in 88 B.C. Pursued by Sulla's
            horsemen, he took refuge in a villa at Laurentum, where he was betrayed by a slave and
            murdered. His head was exhibited on the rostra. The slave was set free by Sulla's orders
            and then hurled down the Tarpeian Rock. Cf. Appian, Bell. Civil. 1. 7. 60: "[Sulpicius
            and others] had been voted enemies of Rome, and anyone who came upon them had been
            authorized to kill them with impunity or to bring them before the consuls [Cornelius
            Sulla and Quintus Pompeius]." Velleius Paterculus, 2. 19, says that Sulpicius and his
            followers were declared exiles by formal decree (lege lata). It was forbidden to bury
            Sulpicius' body; see 4. xxii. 31 below. If this controversia was not merely a school
            exercise, and the murderer was actually called to account, that may have been in the
            year 87, when Sulpicius' party again came into power. See the notes on 4. xiv. 20, xxiv.

        will has directed him to do. A cause rests on Comparison with the Alternative Course when we
        declare that it was necessary for us to do one or the other of the two things, and that the
        one we did was the better. This cause is of the following sort: Gaius Popilius, hemmed in by
        the Gauls, and quite unable to escape, entered into a parley with the enemy's chiefs. He
        came away with consent to lead his army out on condition that he abandon his baggage. He
        considered it better to lose his baggage than his army. He led out his army and left the
        baggage behind. He is charged with treason.<note type="footnote" n="b" place="opposite">b

            hands of the Tigurini in Gaul, C. Popilius Laenas, legate, made a pact: the Roman
            survivors would, in return for hostages and half of their possessions, leave in safety.
            The Roman band went under the yoke of the Tigurini. No mention is here made of the

            precisely with that in the historical accounts. The charge of treason was made in 106 by
            the tribune C. Caelius Caldus; a fragment of the defence appears in 4. xxiv. 34 below.

        are and what are their subdivisions. Now I must illustrate the proper ways and means of
        treating these, first indicating what both sides in a cause ought to fix upon as the point
        to which the complete economy of the entire speech should be directed. </p>

        <note type="margin" n="26">26</note> Immediately upon finding the Type of Issue, then, we must seek the

            pp. 67-78, Jaeneke, De statuum doctrina ab Hermogene tradita, p. 111.</note> It is this
        which determines the action and comprises the defence. Thus Orestes (for the sake of
        clarity, to adhere to this particular action) confesses that he slew his mother. Unless he
        has advanced a Justifying Motive for the act, he will have ruined his defence. He therefore
        advances one; were it not interposed, there would not even be an action. " For she," says
        he, " had slain my father."<note type="footnote" n="b" place="opposite">b Cf. 1. x. 17 and
            1. xv. 25 above.</note> Thus, as I have shown, the Justifying Motive is what comprises
        the defence; without it not even the slightest doubt could exist which would delay his
        condemnation. Upon finding the Motive advanced in Justification we must seek the Central
        Point a of the Accusation, that is, that which comprises the accusation and is presented in
        opposition to the Justifying Motive of the defence which I have discussed above. This will
        be established as follows: When Orestes has used the Justifying Motive: " I had the right to
        kill my mother, for she had slain my father," the prosecutor will use his Central Point: "
        Yes, but not by your hand ought she to have been killed or punished without a trial."<note
            type="footnote" n="c" place="opposite">c Cf. in Aristotle, Rhet. 2. 23 (1397ab), the

            the argument in Theodectes' Orestes. For the argument as used in other Greek tragedies,
            cf. Tyndareüs in Euripides, Orestes 538-9: " My daughter, dying, paid her debt to
            justice, but that she died at his hand was not meet," and Castor, addressing Orestes in
            Electra 1244: " Your mother now has but justice, but your deed is not just."</note> From
        the Justifying Motive of the defence and the Central Point of the Accusation must arise the

            κρινόμενον, Hermagorean doctrine.</note> That will be established from the meeting of
        the prosecutor's Central Point and the defendant's Justifying Motive, as follows: When
        Orestes says that he killed his mother to avenge his father, was it right for Clytemnestra
        to be slain by her son without a trial? This, then, is the proper method of finding the
        Point to Adjudicate. Once the Point to Adjudicate is found, the complete economy of the
        entire speech ought to be directed to it. 27 <note type="margin" n="27">27</note> <milestone unit="section" n="17"/>XVII. The Points to
        Adjudicate will be found in this way in all Types of Issue and their subdivisions, except
        the conjectural.<note type="footnote" n="b" place="opposite">b Cf. Cicero, De Inv. 1. xiv.
            19.</note> Here the Justifying Motive for the act is not in question, for the act is
        denied, nor is the Central Point of the Accusation sought, for no Justifying Motive has been
        advanced. Therefore the Point to Adjudicate is established from the Accusation<note
            type="footnote" n="c" place="opposite">c κατάφασις.</note> and the Denial,<note
            type="footnote" n="d" place="opposite">d ἀπόφασις.</note> as follows: Accusation: "You
        killed Ajax." Denial: "I did not." The Point to Adjudicate: Did he kill him? The complete
        economy of both speeches must, as I have said above, be directed to this Point to
        Adjudicate. If there are several Types of Issue or their subdivisions in one cause, there
        will also be several Points to Adjudicate, but all these, too, will be determined by a like
        method. I have taken great pains to discuss briefly and clearly the matters that have had to
        be treated up to this point. Now, since this Book has grown to sufficient length, it will be
        more convenient in turn to expound other matters in a second Book, so that the great amount

    <p> BOOK II <note type="margin" n="1">1</note> <milestone unit="section" n="1"/>I. In the preceding Book, Herennius, I briefly set forth the
        causes with which the speaker must deal,<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a 1.
            ii. 2.</note> and also the functions of his art to which he may well devote his pains,
        and the means by which he can most easily fulfil these functions.<note type="footnote" n="b"
            place="opposite">b 1. ii. 3.</note> But since it was impossible to treat all the topics
        at once, and I had primarily to discuss the most important of them in order that the rest
        might prove easier for you to understand, I therefore decided to write first upon those that
        are the most difficult. There are three kinds of causes: Epideictic, Deliberative, and
        Judicial. By far the most difficult is the judicial; that is why, in the present Book, and
        in the preceding Book, I have disposed of this kind first of all. Of the five tasks of the
        speaker Invention ^ is the most important<note type="footnote" n="c" place="opposite">c
            Cicero, De Inv. 1. vii. 9: princeps omnium partium.</note> and the most difficult. That
        topic too I shall virtually have disposed of in the present Book; small details will be
        postponed to Book III.<note type="footnote" n="d" place="opposite">d 3. i. 1-viii.
            15.</note>
        <note type="margin" n="2">2</note> I first undertook to discuss the six parts of a discourse. In the
        preceding Book I spoke about the Introduction, the Statement of Facts, and the Division<note
            type="footnote" n="e" place="opposite">e 1. iii. 4-x. 18.</note> at no greater length
        than was necessary nor with less clarity than I judged you desired. I had next to discuss
        Proof and Refutation, conjointly. Hence I expounded the different Types of Issue and their
            subdivisions,<note type="footnote" n="f">f 1. x. 18-xv. 25.</note> and this at the same
        time showed </p>

    <pb n="61"/>
    <p> how the Type of Issue and its subdivision are to be found in a given cause. Then I explained
        how the Point to Adjudicate is properly sought; this found, we must see that the complete
        economy of the entire speech is directed to it.<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite"
            >a 1. xvi. 25-xvii. 27.</note> After that I remarked that there are not a few
            causes<note type="footnote" n="b" place="opposite">b Implied in 1. xvii. 27.</note> to
        which several Types of Issue or their subdivisions are applicable. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>II. It remained for me.
        as it seemed, to show by what method we can adapt the means of invention to each type of
        issue or its subdivision,<note type="footnote" n="c" place="opposite">c The scheme of
            organization under Proof and Refutation is as follows: (a) the Types of Issue (1. x. 18
            to end of Bk. 1); (b) Invention applied to the Types of Issue (2. ii. 3-xvii. 26);<pb
                n="61"/> (c) the tractatio of the arguments devised by Invention (2. xviii. 27-xxix.
            46).</note> and likewise what sort of technical arguments (which the Greeks call

            type="footnote" n="e">e 2. xviii. 27-xix. 30.</note> or avoid;<note type="footnote"
            n="f">f 2. xx. 31-xxix. 46.</note> both of these departments belong to Proof and
        Refutation. Then finally I have explained what kind of Conclusions to speeches one ought to
            employ;<note type="footnote" n="g">g 2. xxx. 47-xxxi. 50.</note> the Conclusion was the
        last of the six parts of a discourse. First, then, I shall investigate how we should handle
        causes representing each Type of Issue, and of course shall give primary consideration to
        that type which is the most important and most difficult. In a Conjectural cause the
        prosecutor's Statement of Facts should contain, intermingled and interspersed in it,
        material inciting suspicion of the defendant, so that no act, no word, no coming or going,
        in short nothing that he has done may be thought to lack a motive. The Statement of Facts of
        the defendant's counsel should contain a simple and clear account, and should also weaken
        suspicion. </p>

    <pb n="63"/>
    <p> The scheme of the Conjectural Issue includes six divisions: Probability, Comparison, Sign,
        Presumptive Proof, Subsequent Behaviour, and Confirmatory Proof. I shall explain the meaning
        of each of these terms. Through Probability<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a
            εἰκός.</note> one proves that the crime was profitable to the defendant, and that he has
        never abstained from this kind of foul practice. The subheads under Probability are Motive
        and Manner of Life.<note type="footnote" n="b" place="opposite">b αἰτία, and ἀγωγή (see
            Anon. Seg. 182, in Spengel-Hammer 1 [2]. 384). The Rhet. ad Alex., ch. 7 (1428 ab),
            divides the Probable into natural feelings (φύσις), habit (ἔθος), and love of gain
            (κέρδος). Cicero, De Inv. 2. v. 16 ff., derives all conjecture from consideration of the
            motive, the person, and the<pb n="63"/> act, distinguishing in motive passion (impulsio)
            and premeditation (ratiocinatio). Quintilian, 7. 2. 7 ff., treats conjecture from the
            point of view of the act and the author (his identity, his intention [animus]).</note>
        The Motive<note type="footnote" n="c">c Cf. Cicero, De Inv. 2. v. 17-viii. 28.</note> is
        what led the defendant to commit the crime, through the hope it gave him of winning
        advantages or avoiding disadvantages.<note type="footnote" n="d">d Cf. in Aristotle, Rhet.
            2. 23 (1399b 30 ff.), the tapos of Inducements and Deterrents; and see note on 2. xxi.
            34 below.</note> The question is: Did he seek some benefit from the crime—honour, money,
        or power? Did he wish to satisfy some passion—love or a like overpowering desire? Or did he
        seek to avoid some disadvantage—enmities, ill <note type="margin" n="4">4</note> repute, pain, or
        punishment? <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>III. Here the prosecutor, if the hope of gaining an advantage is in question,
        will disclose his opponent's passion; if the avoidance of a disadvantage is in question, he
        will enlarge upon his opponent's fear. The defendant's counsel, on the other hand, will, if
        possible, deny that there was a motive, or will at least vigorously belittle its importance;
        then he will say that it i-unfair to bring under suspicion of wrongdoing every one to whom
        some profit has come from an act. </p>

    <pb n="65"/>
    <p>
        <note type="margin" n="5">5</note> Next the defendant's Manner of Life will be examined in the light of
        his previous conduct. First the prosecutor will consider whether the accused has ever
        committed a similar offence.<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a Cf. Cicero, De
            Inv. 2. x. 32.</note> If he does not find any, he will seek to learn whether the accused
        has ever incurred the suspicion of any similar guilt; and it will devolve upon him to make
        every effort to relate the defendant's manner of life to the motive which he has just
        exposed. For example, if the prosecutor contends that the motive for the crime was money,
        let him show that the defendant has always been covetous; if the motive was public honour,
        ambitious; he will thus be able to link the flaw in the defendant's character with the
        motive for the crime. If he cannot find a flaw consistent with the motive, let him find one
        that is not. If he cannot show that the defendant is covetous,<note type="footnote" n="b"
            place="opposite">b Cf. Cicero, De Inv. 2. x. 33.</note> let him show that he is a
        treacherous seducer; in short, if he possibly can, let him brand the defendant with the
        stigma of some one fault, or indeed, of as many faults as possible.<note type="footnote"
            n="c" place="opposite">c Quintilian, 7. 2. 34, discusses charges based on the past life
            of the defendant.</note> Then, he will say, it is no wonder that the man who in that

            50.</note> If the adversary enjoys a high reputation for purity and integrity, the
        prosecutor will say that deeds, not reputation, ought to be considered; that the defendant
        has previously concealed his misdeeds,<note type="footnote" n="e" place="opposite">e Cf.
            Cicero, De Inv. 2. x. 34.</note> and he will make it plain that the defendant is not
        guiltless of misbehaviour. The defendant's counsel will first show his client's upright
            life,<note type="footnote" n="f" place="opposite">f Cf. Cicero, De Inv. 2. xi.
            35.</note> if he can; if he cannot, he will have recourse to thoughtlessness, folly,
        youth, force, or undue influence. On these matters . . . censure ought not to be imposed for
        conduct extraneous to the present charge. If the speaker is seriously </p>

    <pb n="67"/>
    <p> handicapped by the man's baseness and notoriety, he will first take care to say that false
        rumours have been spread about an innocent man, and will use the commonplace that rumours
        ought not to be believed. If none of these pleas is practicable, let him use the last
        resource of defence; let him say that he is not discussing the man's morals before censors,
        but the charges of his opponents before jurors.<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite"

            and not a question of morals before the censors.</note>

            Cicero, De Inv. 2. vii. 24.</note> is used when the prosecutor shows that the act
        charged by him against his adversary has benefited no one but the defendant; or that no one
        but his adversary could have committed it; or that his adversary could not have committed
        it, or at least not so easily, by other means; or that, blinded by passion, his adversary
        failed to see any easier means. To meet this point the defendant's counsel ought to show
        that the crime benefited others as well, or that others as well could have done what is
        imputed to his client. By Signs one shows that the accused sought an opportunity favourable
        to success. Sign<note type="footnote" n="c" place="opposite">c σημεῖον. Different from the

        only the first principles which ought to originate in theory; all the rest will readily be
        supplied by practice. The Point of Time is examined as follows: In what season of the year,
        in what part of the day—whether at night or in the daytime—at what hour of the day<note

        alleged to have been committed, and why at such a time? The Duration of Time will be
        considered in the following fashion: Was it long enough to carry this act through, and did
        the defendant know that there would be enough time to accomplish it? For it is only of
        slight importance that he had enough time to carry out the crime if he could not in advance
        have known or have forecast that that would be so. The Occasion is examined as follows: Was
        it favourable for the undertaking, or was there a better occasion which was either let pass
        or not awaited? Whether there was any Hope of Success will be investigated as follows: Do
        the above-mentioned signs coincide? Especially, do power, money, good judgement,
        foreknowledge, and preparedness appear on one side, and is it proved that on the other there
        were weakness, need, stupidity, lack of foresight, and unpreparedness? Hereby one will know
        whether the defendant should have had confidence in his success or not. What Hope there was
        of Escaping Detection we seek to learn from confidants, eye-witnesses, or accomplices,
        freemen or slaves or both.<note type="footnote" n="b" place="opposite">b Cf. Aristotle,

        indications that increase certainty and strengthen suspicion. It falls into three periods:
        preceding the crime, contemporaneous with the crime, following the crime.<note
            type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a Cf. Cicero, De Inv. 2. xiii. 43. Argumentum is
            virtually equivalent to the σημεῖον (fallible sign) of the Rhet. ad Alex. (ch. 12,
            1430b). The tradition thus antedates Aristotle and persisted against his theory of
            σημεῖον, which joined with εἰκός (the probable proposition) in forming the material of
            the enthymeme (E. M. Cope, An Introd. to Aristotle's Rhetoric, London and Cambridge,
            1867, pp. 160 ff.). The communes loci dealing with the περιστάσεις are akin to the
            Aristotelian kind of topoi, but are not specifically Aristotelian. They belong in the
            Hermagorean system of Issues, but the specific division of σημεῖα into three periods
            goes back to pre-Aristotelian rhetorical theory (Rhet. ad Alex., l.c.). Neocles (first
            or second Christian century) in Anon. Seg. 153 (Spengel-Hammer 1 [2]. 379) divides
            probabilities, signs, and examples<pb n="71"/> into three types according to the same
            chronological scheme, " as cloud indicating storm, smoke fire, and blood murder." Σημεῖα
            and εἰκότα were used by the Attic orators as early as Antiphon, and by Thucydides; see
            Friedrich Solmsen, Die Entwicklung der aristotelischen Logik und Rheiorik (Neue Philol.
            Untersuch. 4), Berlin, 1929, pp. 26-7, and Antiphonstudien (Neue Philol. Untersuch. 8),
            Berlin, 1931, pp. 50 ff.</note> In respect to the period preceding the crime, one ought
        to consider where the defendant was, where he was seen, with whom seen, whether he made some
        preparation, met any one, said anything, or showed any sign of having confidants,
        accomplices, or means of assistance; whether he was in a place, or there at a time, at
        variance with his custom. In respect to the period contemporaneous with the crime, we shall
        seek to learn whether he was seen in the act; whether some noise, outcry, or crash was
        heard; or, in short, whether anything was perceived by one of the senses—sight, hearing,
        touch, smell, or taste. For any type of sense-experience can arouse suspicion. In respect to
        the period following the crime, one will seek to discover whether after the act was
        completed there was left behind anything indicating that a crime was committed, or by whom
        it was committed. Indicating that it was committed: for example, if the body of the deceased
        is swollen and black and blue it signifies that the man was killed by poison. Indicating by
        whom it was committed: for example, if a weapon, or clothing, or something of the kind was
        left behind, or a footprint of the accused was dis- </p>

    <pb n="73"/>
    <p> covered; if there was blood on his clothes; or if, after the deed was done, he was caught or
        seen in the spot where the crime is alleged to have been perpetrated. For Subsequent
        Behaviour we investigate the signs which usually attend guilt or innocence.<note

        when suspicion has been established. It has special and common topics.<note type="footnote"

    <p> cause the prosecutor uses a special topic when he says that wicked men ought not to be
        pitied, and expatiates upon the atrocity of the crime. The defendant's counsel uses a
        special topic when he tries to win pity, and charges the prosecutor with slander. These
        topics are common to both prosecution and defence: to speak for<note type="footnote" n="a"

        under torture, for or against presumptive proof, and for or against rumours.<note
            type="footnote" n="b" place="opposite">b The non-technical means of persuasion (πίστεις
            ἄτεχνοι), those that are not inherent in the art, that are not supplied by our own
            efforts. See Aristotle, Rhet. 1. 2 (1355b) and L 15 (1375a), who lists five: laws,
            witnesses, contracts, evidence given under torture, and the oath. The theory is
            pre-Aristotelian; cf. Rhet. ad Alex., chaps. 7 (1428a) and 14 (1431b) ff., on the
            supplementary proofs (ἐπίθετοι πίστεις): the speaker's own opinion, witnesses,
            admissions under torture, and oaths. The employment of these proofs long antedated<pb
                n="75"/> argumentation in the law-courts; when argumentation came into being its
            first function was to interpret these " already existing " proofs.</note> In favour of
            witnesses<note type="footnote" n="c">c μάρτυρες.</note> we shall speak under the heads:
        (a) authority and manner of life of the witnesses, and (b) the consistency of their
        evidence. Against witnesses, under the heads: (a) their base manner of living; (b) the
        contradictory character of their testimony; (c) if we contend that what they allege to have
        happened either could not have happened or did not happen, or that they could not have known
        it, or that it is partiality which inspires their words and inferences. These topics will
        appertain both to the discrediting and to the examination of witnesses. <note type="margin" n="10"
            >10</note> VII. We shall speak in favour of the testimony given under torture<note
            type="footnote" n="d">d βάσανοι. To be distinguished from iudicii quaestio (1. xvi. 26).
            Torture was administered under the direction of the court, but not in the presence of
            the jury. The torture of free men was not legal.</note> when we show that it was in
        order to discover the truth that our ancestors wished investigations to make use of torture
        and the rack, and that men are compelled by violent pain to tell all they know. Moreover,
        such reasoning will have </p>

    <pb n="77"/>
    <p> the greater force if we give the confessions elicited under torture an appearance of
        plausibility by the same argumentative procedure as is used in treating any question of
        fact. And this, too, we shall have to do with the evidence of witnesses. Against the
        testimony given under torture we shall speak as follows: In the first place, our ancestors
        wished inquisitions to be introduced only in connection with unambiguous matters, when the
        true statement in the inquisition could be recognized and the false reply refuted; for
        example, if they sought to learn in what place some object was put, or if there was in
        question something like that which could be seen, or be verified by means of footprints, or
        be perceived by some like sign. We then shall say that pain ought not to be relied upon,
        because one person is less exhausted by pain, or more resourceful in fabrication, than
        another, and also because it is often possible to know or divine what the presiding justice
        wishes to hear, and the witness knows that when he has said this his pain will be at an end.
        Such reasoning will find favour, if, by a plausible argument, we refute the statements made
        in the testimony given under torture; and to accomplish this we should use the divisions
        under the Conjectural Issue which I have set forth above.<note type="footnote" n="a"
            place="opposite">a 2. ii. 3-v. 8.</note>
        <note type="margin" n="11">11</note> In favour of presumptive proof, signs, and the other means of
        increasing suspicion it is advantageous to speak as follows: When there is a concurrence of
        many circumstantial indications and signs that agree with one another, the result ought to
        appear as clear fact, not surmise. Again, signs and presumptive proof deserve more credence
        than witnesses, for these first are presented precisely as they occurred in </p>

    <pb n="79"/>
    <p> reality, whereas witnesses can be corrupted by bribery, or partiality, or intimidation, or
            animosity.<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a For the same sentiment cf.

            on his side will argue " that probabilities cannot be bribed to mislead the court, and
            are never convicted of false witness."</note> Against presumptive proof, signs, and the
        other provocatives of suspicion we shall speak in the following fashion: we shall show that
        nothing is safe from attack by suspicion, and then we shall weaken each and every reason for
        suspicion and try to show that it applies to us no more than to any one else; it is a
        shameful outrage to consider suspicion and conjecture, in the absence of witnesses, as
        sufficiently corroborative. <note type="margin" n="12">12</note> <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>VIII. We shall speak in favour of
        rumours by saying that a report is not wont to be created recklessly and without some
        foundation, and that there was no reason for anybody wholly to invent and fabricate one;
        and, moreover, if other rumours usually are lies, we shall prove by argument that this one
        is true. We shall speak against rumours if we first show that many rumours are false, and
        cite examples of false report; if we say that the rumours were the invention of our enemies
        or of other men malicious and slanderous by nature; and if we either present some story
        invented against our adversaries which we declare to be in every mouth, or produce a true
        report carrying some disgrace to them, and say we yet have no faith in it for the reason
        that any person at all can produce and spread any disgraceful rumour or fiction about any
        other person. If, nevertheless, a rumour seems highly plausible, we can destroy its
        authority by logical argument. </p>

    <p> Because the Conjectural Issue is the hardest to treat and in actual causes<note

        be treated most often, I have the more carefully examined all its divisions, in order that
        we may not be hindered by even the slightest hesitation or blunder, if only we have applied
        these precepts of theory in assiduous practice. Now let me turn to the subtypes of Legal
        Issue. <note type="margin" n="13">13</note> <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>IX. When the intention of the framer appears at variance
        with the letter of a text, speaking in support of the letter<note type="footnote" n="b"
            place="opposite">b Cf. Cicero, De lnv. 2. xliii. 125.</note> we shall employ the
        following topics: first, after the Statement of Facts, a eulogy of the framer and then the
        reading aloud of the text; next the questioning of our adversaries: Are they duly aware that
        this text was in a law, will, contract, or any other document involved in the cause?; then a
        comparison of the text with the admitted act of our adversaries: Which should the judge
        follow—a document carefully draughted, or an interpretation cunningly invented? After that
        the interpretation devised and given to the text by our adversaries will be disparaged and
        weakened. Then the question will be raised: What risk would the writer have run by adding an
        entry of that kind had he really intended it, or was it impossible to write it out in full?
        Then we shall ascertain the writer's intention and present the reason why he had in mind
        what he wrote, and show that that text is clear, concise, apt, complete, and planned with
        precision. Thereupon we shall cite examples of judgements rendered in favour of the text,
        although adversaries raised the issue of spirit and intention. Finally, we shall show the
        danger of departing from the letter of the text. The commonplace here is that against one
        who, though confessing </p>

    <pb n="83"/>
    <p> that he has violated the mandates of a statute or the directions of a will, yet seeks to
        defend his act. <note type="margin" n="14">14</note> <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>X. In favour of the intention we shall speak as
        follows: first we shall praise the framer for deft conciseness in having written only what
        was necessary; he did not think it necessary to write what could be understood without a
        text. Next we shall say that to follow the words literally and to neglect the intention is
        the method of a pettifogger.<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a ἀκριβοδίκαιος.
            Cf. Cicero, Pro Caecina 23. 65: [People who feel that they have equity on their side say
            that] " a pettifogger follows the letter; a good juror defends the will and intention of
            the framer."</note> Then, we shall contend, the letter either cannot be carried out, or
        at least not without violation of Statute Law, Legal Custom, the Law of Nature, or Equity
            <note type="footnote" n="b" place="opposite">b The departments of Law, considered in 2.
            xiii. 19-20 below.</note>—all these, as no one will deny, the writer wished to be most
        strictly observed; but on the contrary, what we have done is absolutely just. Further, the
        interpretation of our adversaries is either no interpretation, or is unreasonable, unjust,
        impracticable, or inconsistent with past or subsequent interpretations, or is in
        disagreement with the common law<note type="footnote" n="c" place="opposite">c κοινὸν

            by Pericles in an actual case; see Lysias, Adv. Andoc. 10). Cf. Aristotle, Rhet. 1. 10
            (1368b): " By universal law I mean all the unwritten principles that are supposed to be
            acknowledged by all mankind "; 1. 13 (1373b): " For indeed there is, as all men to some
            extent divine, a natural and universal<pb n="83"/> notion of right and wrong, binding on
            them even if they have no mutual intercourse or covenant "; 1. 15 (1375 a): " It is
            clear that if the written law is adverse to our case, he [the speaker] must appeal to
            the universal law, and to the principles of equity as representing a higher order of
            justice. [He must say] that [the judge's obligation to decide] ' according to my best
            judgement ' means that the judge will not be guided simply and solely by the letter of
            the statute " (tr. Lane Cooper); Cope, An Introd. to Aristotle's Rhetoric, pp. 239-44.
            Cf. also the Stoic Chrysippus in Diogenes Laertius 7. 88: " The common law, the right
            reason pervading all things; " and Cicero, De Offic. 3. 17. 69.</note> or with other
        generally binding rules of law or with previous decisions. Next we shall cite instances of
        decisions rendered in favour of the intention and contrary to the letter, and then </p>

    <pb n="85"/>
    <p> read and explain laws or contracts which had been written down in concise form and yet in
        which the intention of the framer is understood. The commonplace here is that against one
        who reads a text and does not interpret the writer's intention. <note type="margin" n="15">15</note>
        When two laws conflict, we must first see whether they have been superseded or restricted,
        and then whether their disagreement is such that one commands and the other prohibits, or
        one compels and the other allows. It will be a weak defence indeed for a person to say that
        he failed to do what one law ordained, because another law made it optional; for obligation
        is more binding than mere permission. So also it is a meagre defence for a person to show
        that he has observed the obligation of a law which has been superseded or restricted,
        without heeding the obligation of the later law. After these considerations we shall at once
        pass to the exposition, reading, and warm recommendation of the law favourable to us. Then
        we shall elucidate the intention of the opposing law and appropriate it for the advantage of
        our cause. Finally, we shall take over the theory of Law from the Absolute Juridical Issue,
        and examine with which side the departments of Law hold; this subtype of a Juridical Issue I
        shall discuss later.<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a See 2. xiii.

        interpreted in two or more meanings, the treatment is as follows: first we must examine
        whether it is indeed ambiguous; then we must show how it would have been written if the
        writer had wished it to have the meaning which our adversaries give to it; next, that our
        interpretation is practicable, and practicable in conformity with the Honourable and the

        not ambiguous since one well understands which is the true sense. There are some who think
        that for the development of this kind of cause a knowledge of amphibolies as taught by the
        dialecticians is highly useful. I, however, believe that this knowledge is of no help at
        all, and is, I may even say, a most serious hindrance. In fact these writers are on the
        lookout for all amphibolies, even for such as yield no sense at all in one of the two
        interpretations. Accordingly, when some one else speaks, they are his annoying hecklers, and
        when he writes, they are his boring and also misty interpreters. And when they themselves
        speak, wishing to do so cautiously and deftly, they prove to be utterly inarticulate. Thus,
        in their fear to utter some ambiguity while speaking, they cannot even pronounce their own
        names. Indeed I shall refute the childish opinions of these writers by the most
        straightforward proofs whenever you wish. For the present it has not been out of place to
        make this protest, in order to express my contempt for the wordy learning of this school of
            inarticulateness.<note type="footnote" n="b" place="opposite">b Isocrates, Panath.

        used to examine whether it was better to do that which the defendant says he did, or that
        which the prosecutor says should have been done, it will be proper first to ascertain from
        the conflict which was the more advantageous, that is, more honourable, practicable, and
            profitable.<note type="footnote" n="b" place="opposite">b Cf. the definition of
            Advantage, 3. ii. 3 below.</note> Next we ought to discover whether the defendant
        himself should have decided which was the more advantageous, or whether the right to
        determine this belonged to others. Then the prosecutor, in accordance with the procedure in
        a conjectural issue, will interpose a suspicion leading to the belief that the defendant had
        not by his act intended to prefer the better to the worse, but had carried out the business
        with wilful fraud on some plausible ground. Let the defendant's counsel, on his side, refute
        the conjectural argument referred to above. Then the question will be whether this <note

        These points thus treated, the prosecutor will use the commonplace against one who has
        preferred the disadvantageous to the advantageous when he lacked the right of decision. The
        defendant's counsel, on his part, will use a commonplace in the form of a complaint against
        those who deem it equitable to prefer the ruinous to the advantageous; and at the same time

        next, whether a judicial decision ought not to have been rendered before he committed his
        act; then, in the absence of a judicial decision on the offence which is being imputed to
        another, whether a decision ought now to be rendered on a matter which has never come to

        been convicted, contending that the adversaries have set the example. What if the accuser
        himself had wished to do likewise? The defendant's counsel will set forth the atrocity of
        the crime committed by those to whom he is shifting the issue of guilt; he will present
        before the eyes of the hearers the circumstances, the place, and the time so that they may
        think that it was either impossible or inexpedient for the matter to come to trial<note

    <pb n="101"/>
    <p> The Exculpation is our denial that we acted with intent. Subheads under Plea of Exculpation
        are Necessity, Accident, and Ignorance. These are to be explained first, and then, as it
        seems, it will be best to return to the Plea for Mercy. One must first consider whether it
        was the defendant's fault that he was brought to this necessity.<note type="footnote" n="a"
            place="opposite">a Cf. Cicero, De Inv. 2. xxxii. 98 ff.</note> After that we must
        inquire what means he had to avoid or lighten this superior force. Next, did he who offers
        necessity as an excuse try to do, or to contrive, what lie could against it? Then, cannot
        some grounds for suspicion be drawn from the procedure in a conjectural issue, which would
        signify that the deed attributed to necessity was premeditated? Finally, if there was some
        extreme necessity, is it proper to deem this a sufficient excuse? <note type="margin" n="24">24</note>
        If the defendant says that he erred through ignorance,<note type="footnote" n="b"

            a).</note> the first question will be: Could he or could he not have been uninformed?
        Next, did he or did he not make an effort to inform himself? Then, is his ignorance
        attributable to accident or to his own fault? For a person who declares that his reason fied
        because of wine or love or anger, will appear to have lacked comprehension through fault of
        character rather than ignorance<note type="footnote" n="c" place="opposite">c Cf. Aristotle,

            The Rhet. ad Alex., ch. 7 (1429 a), admits such a defence as a last resort.</note>
        Finally, by means of the procedure in a conjectural issue, we shall seek to discover whether
        he was or was not informed, and consider whether ignorance should be sufficient

        to be considered are precisely those prescribed above for necessity; for all these three
        divisions of Exculpation are so closely interrelated that virtually the same rules can be

        it to ignorance, chance, or necessity, and yet beg for pardon. Here the ground for pardoning
        is sought in the following topics: if it seems evident that the good deeds of the suppliant
        have been more numerous or more weighty than the bad; if he is endowed with some virtue, or
        with good birth; if there is any hope that he will be of service in the event that he
        departs unpunished; if the suppliant himself is shown to have been gentle and

        will be used by the adversary, who will also amplify and recount the defendant's
        transgressions. Such a cause is not admissible in the courts, as I showed in Book I,<note
            type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a 1. xiv. 24. Cf. Cicero, De Inv. 2. xxxiv.
            105.</note> but because it is admissible either before the Senate or a council, I have
        decided that I should not pass it over. When we wish to Reject the Responsibility, we shall
        throw the blame for our crime either upon some circumstance or upon another person.<note
            type="footnote" n="b" place="opposite">b Cicero, De Inv. 2. xxix. 86-xxx. 94, considers
            also the situation (remotio rei) in which the defendant denies that the act he is
            charged with concerned him or his duty. Cf. also Exculpation, 2. xvi. 23 above.</note>
        If upon a person, we must first examine whether the person to whom the responsibility is
        transferred had as much influence as the defendant will represent; next, whether the
        defendant could somehow have resisted this influence honourably or safely;<note

        even if the conditions are in fullest measure such as the defendant represents them to be,
        whether it is nevertheless proper to make allowances to him just because he acted on
        another's persuasion. Then we shall turn the controversy into one of fact and examine in
        detail whether there was premeditation. If the responsibility is transferred to some
        circumstance, virtually these same precepts and all those that I have set forth on
            Necessity<note type="footnote" n="d">d 2. xvi. 23 above.</note> are to be observed.

    <p> explain how to develop<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a Tractatio and inventio
            supplement each other; Cicero, De Oratore 2. 41. 176: " We now see that it is by no
            means enough to find what to say, unless you are able to handle it (id inventum
            tractare) skilfully once found;" cf. also ibid., 2. 27. 120. The tradition is
            Isocratean; Paneg. 9: " For the deeds of the past are a heritage common to us all, but
            the ability to make full use (= χρῆσις) of them at the proper time, in each instance to
            form the right conceptions about them, and to set these forth in a finished style, is
            the special gift of them that know." Cf. 1. ii. 2, 2. ii. 2, 3. iv. 7, 3. vi. 11.</note>
        these arguments elegantly and completely. To be sure, it is in general not hard to devise
        matter which should serve to support a cause, but to polish what has been devised and to
        give it a ready delivery is very hard. Indeed it is this faculty which keeps us from
        dwelling longer than necessary on the same topics, from returning again and again to the
        same place, abandoning a chain of argument before it has been completed, and making an
        inappropriate transition to the next argument. By the following method, therefore, we can
        ourselves remember what we have said in each place, and the hearer can perceive and remember
        the distribution of the parts in the whole cause and also in each particular argument. <note
            type="margin" n="28">28</note>The most complete and perfect argument, then, is that which is
        comprised of five parts: the Proposition, the Reason, the Proof of the Reason, the
        Embellishment, and the Résumé.<note type="footnote" n="b" place="opposite">b Cicero, De Inv.
            1. xxxvii. 67, divides the deductive argument (argumentatio per ratiocinationem) into
            propositio, propositionis approbatio, assumptio, assumptionis approbatio, and complexio.
            While Aristotle in forming arguments constructs the enthymeme in close analogy with the
            logical syllogism (e.g., Rhet. 1. 2, 1356 b), our author, with the practical speaker in
            mind in this meagre treatment, shows little interest in the syllogistic form. The
            epicheireme is more complicated than<pb n="107"/> the enthymeme (of which it is a later
            name). Aristotle's enthymeme (and, later, also Quintilian's [epicheireme]; see 5. 14. 6)
            comprised two premises and conclusion; the epicheireme normally comprised four premises.
            Aristotle took the premises for granted; the later rhetoricians thought it necessary to
            prove each. The epicheireme may have developed under Stoic influence. Cicero, De Inv. 1.
            xxxv. 61, makes it clear that the quinquepartite epicheireme grew out of Aristotle's
            syllogism; Theophrastus, following observations of Isocrates, may have been the first to
            introduce it into rhetoric. Cicero's syllogistic form (ratiocinatio) is logical; he
            treats it on a par with Socratic induction. See Cicero, De Inv. 1. xxxiv. 57 ff.;
            Quintilian, 5. 10. 1 ff. and 5. 14. 5 ff.; Wilhelm Kroll, Das Epicheirema, in Sitzungsb.

            Amer. Journ. Philol. 62 (1941). 39 ff., 169 ff. It is doubtful whether the epicheireme
            as here described was very widely used in actual oratory.</note> Through the </p>

        The Reason, by means of a brief explanation subjoined, sets forth the causal basis for the
        Proposition, establishing the truth of what we are urging. The Proof of the Reason
        corroborates, by means of additional arguments, the briefly presented Reason. Embellishment
        we use in order to adorn and enrich the argument, after the Proof has been established. The
        Résumé is a brief conclusion, drawing together the parts of the argument. Hence, to make the
        most complete use of these five parts, we shall develop an argument as follows:<note

            place="opposite">c The Proposition. Here begins a progymnasma (σύγκρισις of persons).
            The theme was first taken up in 1. xi. 18 above. Thiele, Hermagoras, pp. 159-163,
            conjectures that the source of both theme (originally a ὅπλων κρίσις or an Αἴασ of
            tragedy) and treatment by five-fold epicheireme is Hermagoras. Cf. Quintilian, 4. 2. 13;
            Ulysses replies that he did not do the deed, and had no quarrel with Ajax, and that
            their conflict was concerned only with renown.</note> " Indeed he wished to rid himself
        of his bitterest enemy, from whom, with good cause, he feared extreme danger to
            himself.<note type="footnote" n="d" place="opposite">d The Reason.</note> " He saw that,
        with Ajax alive, his own life would be unsafe; he hoped by the death of Ajax to secure his
        own safety; it was his habit to plan an enemy's destruction by whatsoever wrongful means,
        when he could not by rightful, as the undeserved death of Palamedes bears witness.<note
            type="footnote" n="e" place="opposite">e Ulysses hated Palamedes because he had exposed
            Ulysses' deceit in feigning madness so as to avoid joining the<pb n="109"/> Greek
            expedition to Troy, and because Ulysses envied his fame for wisdom. According to another
            tradition this hatred arose from the severe reproof Palamedes dealt out to Ulysses for
            returning empty-handed from a foraging expedition. The stories of the vengeance also
            differ. Ulysses and Diomedes induced him to descend into a well in order to find alleged
            treasure, and then stoned him; or they drowned him while he was fishing; or with
            Agamemnon they bribed a servant of Palamedes to conceal under Palamedes' bed a forged
            letter from Priam offering a bribe of gold, accused Palamedes of treachery, and when the
            letter (or gold) was discovered, caused him to be stoned by the Greeks.</note> Thus the
        fear of danger </p>

    <pb n="111"/>
    <p> encouraged him to slay the man from whom he dreaded vengeance, and, in addition, the habit
        of wrong-doing robbed him of his scruples at undertaking the evil deed.<note type="footnote"

        wrongdoing, if from greed for power not a few have tainted themselves with crime,if numerous
        men have trafficked for a paltry profit with arrant deceit, who will find it strange that
        Ulysses, when under stress of acute terror, did not refrain from crime? A hero most brave,
        most upright, most implacable against his foes, harassed by a wrong, roused to anger—him the
        frightened, malevolent, guilt-conscious, guileful man wished to destroy; the treacherous man
        did not wish his bitter enemy to stay alive. To whom, pray, will this seem strange? For when
        we see wild beasts rush eagerly and resolutely to attack one another, we must not think it
        incredible that this creature, too—a wild, cruel, inhuman spirit—set out passionately to
        destroy his enemy; especially since in beasts we see no reasoning, good or bad, while he, we

        memory. There is a situation, too, in which the Embellishment should be omitted—if the
        matter proves to be too meagre for amplification and adornment. And if the argument is brief
        and the matter also slight or insignificant, then both the Embellishment and the Resume
        should be left out. This rule which I have just set forth is to be observed for the last two
        parts in every argument.<note type="footnote" n="b" place="opposite">b Arrangement

        Defective arguments<note type="footnote" n="c" place="opposite">c Our author omitted to use

            refuted<note type="footnote" n="d">d Reprehensio = λύσις</note> by the adversary, and so
        belongs to the cause proper; "the other, although likewise invalid, does not need to be

        which it is proper to refute in rebuttal, and those which it is proper to ignore in
        disdainful silence and to abstain from refuting. This knowledge of defective arguments will
        confer a double advantage. It will warn us to avoid a fault in arguing, and teach us
        skilfully to reprehend a fault not avoided by others. Since, then, I have shown that a
        perfect and full argument consists of five parts,<note type="footnote" n="e">e Cf. Cicero,
            De Inv. 1. xlii. 79.</note> let us consider the </p>

    <pb n="115"/>
    <p> faults to be avoided in each single part of the argument, so that we may ourselves be able
        to shun these faults, and by the following rules test the argument of our adversaries in all
        its parts and undermine it in some one of these. <note type="margin" n="32">32</note> The Proposition is
        defective when an assertion based on some one part or on a majority of individuals, but not
        necessarily applicable to all, is referred to all, as if one should argue as follows: " All
        the poor would rather do wrong and acquire riches than do right and remain poor." If a
        speaker has presented this sort of Proposition in an argument, without caring to ask of what
        nature the Reason or the Proof of the Reason is to be, we shall easily refute his
        Proposition by showing that what is true of one dishonest poor man is being falsely and
        unjustly applied to all the poor.<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a The fallacy
            of False Generalization. Cf. Cicero, De Inv. 1. xliii. 80.</note>
        <note type="margin" n="33">33</note> Again, the Proposition is defective when a rare occurrence is
        declared to be absolutely impossible, as follows: " No one can fall in love at a single
        glance, or as he is passing by."<note type="footnote" n="b" place="opposite">b In Cicero, De
            Inv. 1. xliii. 80, this observation is assigned to the speech delivered by C. Scribonius
            Curio (first of the three orators of that name, praetor in 121 B.C.) in defence of
            Servius Fulvius in a prosecution for incest. According to Cicero, Brutus 32. 122, the
            speech was once esteemed a masterpiece.</note> For inasmuch as some have fallen in love
        at first sight, and yet the speaker has >aid " no one." it is of no significance whatsoever
        that the experience occurs but rarely, provided we understand that it sometimes does occur,
        or even only that it can occur. <milestone unit="section" n="21"/>XXI. Again, the Proposition is defective when we submit that
        we have made a complete enumeration of the possibilities and pass by some pertinent
            one,<note type="footnote" n="c">c The fallacy of Incomplete Disjunction. Cf. Cicero, De
            Inv. 1. xlv. 84.</note> as follows: " Since, then, it is established that the man was

        made </p>

    <pb n="117"/>
    <p> part-heir. In that place robbers have never been seen. He had no enemy. If he was not killed
        by robbers, of whom there were none, nor by enemies, of whom he had none, it remains that he
        was slain by you." We shall refute a Proposition of this type by showing that others besides
        those whom the speaker has enumerated could have undertaken the crime.<note type="footnote"
            n="a" place="opposite">a Cf. Cicero, De Inv. 1. xiv. 85.</note> Here, for example, when
        he has said that the murder must have been committed by robbers, or by enemies, or by us, we
        shall say that it could have been committed by the man's slaves or by our co-heirs. When we
        have in this way upset the enumeration made by our accusers, we have left ourselves wider
        room for defence. This then is another mistake always to be avoided in the Proposition—the
        omission of some pertinent item when we think that we have included all. <note type="margin" n="34"
            >34</note> Again, the Proposition is defective if it is based on a false enumeration and

            Cicero, Pro S. Rose. Am. 27. 75: " The city creates luxury; from luxury greed inevitably

        all men: fear, desire, and worry." Indeed it had been enough to say fear and desire, since
        worry is necessarily conjoined with both. <milestone unit="section" n="22"/>XXII. Again, the Proposition is defective if it
        traces things too far back, as follows: " Stupidity is the mother and matter of all evils.
        She gives birth to boundless desires. Furthermore, boundless desires have neither end nor
        limit. They breed avarice. Avarice, further, drives men to any crime you will. Thus it is

    <p> it were adequate, if poets had a care for mere adequacy, to say: " Would that my misled
        mistress had not set foot away from home." In the Proposition, then, we must also carefully
        guard against this tracing of things back to their remotest origin; for the Proposition does
        not, like many others, need to be refuted, but is on its own account defective.<note
            type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a Its faultiness is self-evident. Cf. Plato,
            Sophist 252 C: " They do not need others to refute them, but, as the saying goes, they
            have an enemy and adversary who dwells in the same house with them."</note>
        <note type="margin" n="35">35</note> <milestone unit="section" n="23"/>XXIII. The Reason is defective if it is inappropriate to the
        Proposition because either weak or groundless. It is weak when it does not conclusively
        demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition, as in Plautus: " To reprove a friend for a
        fault that deserves reproof is a thankless task, but in season useful and profitable." That
        is the Proposition. Let us see what Reason is presented: " For<note type="footnote" n="b">b
            Trinummus 23-6. A proper translation would be: " For instance, today." Nam, here
            appearing in colloquial speech, introduces a particular instance of a general statement;
            it is transitional rather than confirmatory, and so the charge that Megaronides uses a
            false syllogism is unjust. Cicero, De Inv. 1.1. 95, is guilty of the same
            misunderstanding. See W. M. Lindsay, Syntax of Plautus, Oxford, 1907, p. 100.</note>
        today I shall severely reprove my friend for a fault that much deserves reproof." His
        reckoning of what is useful is based on what he himself is about to do, and not on what it
        is proper to do. A Reason is groundless when it rests on a false supposition, as follows: "
        One must not flee from love,for it engenders the truest friendship."<note type="footnote"
            n="c">c Cf. Aristotle, Rhet. 2. 24 (1401 b), illustrating, among the sham enthymemes,
            the topos from a sign (a single instance used to prove the rule): " For example, one
            might say that lovers are of service to their countries, for it was the love of
            Harmodius and Aristogeiton which brought about the downfall of the tyrant
            Hipparchus."</note> Or as follows: " One must spurn philosophy, for it </p>

    <pb n="123"/>
    <p> produces inactivity and sloth."<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a Cf. R. W.
            Emerson in " The American Scholar ": " Inaction is cowardice, but there can be no
            scholar without the heroic mind.'' For other echoes of the opposition to philosophy and
            art see 2. xxvii. 43 and 4. xxxii. 43.</note> If all these Reasons were not false, we
        should also be obliged to admit the truth of their Propositions. <note type="margin" n="36">36</note>
        Again, a Reason is weak if the causal basis which it submits for the Proposition is not a
        compelling one. For example, Pacuvius: " The goddess Fortune is mad, blind, and stupid, some
        philosophers maintain. They declare that she stands upon a revolving globe of stone;<note
            type="footnote" n="b">b Cf. the like portrayal of Fortune in Cebetis Tabula (probably
            first Christian century), ch. 7 (ed. Praechter, p. 6), and Shakespeare, Henry V, 3. 6.

        thither, they say, does Fortune fall. She is blind, they repeat, for that she fails wholly
        to perceive whereto she attaches herself. Moreover they declare that she is mad because she
        is cruel, uncertain, and inconstant; stupid because she knows not how to tell worthy from
        unworthy. But there are other philosophers who, on the contrary, deny that in our wretched
        life there is any such thing as Fortune; there is, they say, Blind Accident. That this is
        more like the truth, is proved by the actual experience of life; even as Orestes now was
        king, and now became a beggar. Surely by the shipwreck of his property was this brought to
        pass, and did not befall by Chance or Fortune."<note type="footnote" n="c">c We do not know
            to which play this fragment (from a prologue, perhaps) is to be assigned. Ribbeck, 1.

        Reason, but says precisely the same as was said in the Proposition,<note type="footnote"
            n="a">a Cf. Cicero, De Inv. 1. 1. 95.</note> as follows: " A great evil to mankind is
        greed, for the reason that men wrestle with great and many ills on account of the boundless
        passion for money." Here the Reason merely repeats in other words what has been said in the
        Proposition. Again, a Reason is weak if the causal basis which it submits for the
        Proposition is inadequate to the demands of the subject,<note type="footnote" n="b">b Very
            like the type of fallacy in 2. xxiii. 36 above.</note> as follows: " Wisdom is useful
        because the wise have been in the habit of cultivating a sense of duty." Or, " It is useful
        to have true friends, for thus you may have persons with whom you can jest." In Reasons of
        this kind the Proposition is supported not by a universal or absolute reason, but by a
        feeble one. Again, the Reason is weak if it can at choice be applied to another
            Proposition,<note type="footnote" n="c">c An Introduction similarly defective is called
            banal in 1. vii. 11 above.</note> as in the case of Pacuvius, who presents the same
        reason for calling Fortune blind as for calling her stupid.<note type="footnote" n="d">d 2.

        <note type="margin" n="38">38</note> In the Proof of the Reason, there are many faults to be avoided in
        our discourse and also to be watched for in that of our adversaries. These must be

        cogent support of the whole argument. </p>

            those who helped or advised the allies to take up arms against Rome. Sulpicius' law in

            the proposal may have been intended to avoid constitutional objections that the

        recalling not " exiles," but " those ejected by violence "—as though the dispute concerned
        the name by which to call those people, or as though all to whom water and fire have been

            Audience (including the Appeal to Pity), together with Discrediting the Opponent. To
            Aristotle, Rhet. 3. 19 (1419 b), the Conclusion has four functions: to conciliate the
            audience and discredit the opponent, to magnify and depreciate, to excite the emotions
            required by the case, and to review what has been said. Cicero, De Inv. 1. lii. 98,

            17. 59: " There are two occasions for the Summing Up—if you mistrust the memory of those

            or if, by repeatedly presenting arguments that strengthen your speech and setting these
            forth briefly, your case will have more force; " Quintilian, 6. 1. 1: " The Summing Up .
            . . both refreshes the memory of the index and at the same time places the whole case
            before his eyes." Cf. the enumeratio of 1. x. 17 above, and complexio, the Résumé of an

        made—briefly, that the speech may not be repeated in entirety, but that the memory of it may
        be refreshed; and we shall reproduce all the points in the order in which they have been
        presented, so that the hearer, if he has committed them to memory, is brought back to what
        he remembers. Again, we must take care that the Summary should not be carried back to the
        Introduction or the Statement of Facts. Otherwise the speech will appear to </p>

        advertise his wit, and display his memory. Therefore the Summary must take its beginning
        from the Division. Then we must in order and briefly set forth the points treated in the
        Proof and Refutation. Amplification is the principle of using Commonplaces to stir<note
            type="footnote" n="b" place="opposite">b The purpose of Amplification is δείνωσις

            communes (see note on 2. vi. 9 above) are here attached to Amplification (αὔξησις),
            which, in turn, is a subhead under the Conclusion. The theory of Amplification was first
            formed for epideictic; Gorgias, Tisias (Plato, Phaedrus 267 A), and Isocrates gave it
            prominence. Cf. Cicero, Part. Orat. 15. 52: " The right place for Amplification is in
            the Peroration; but also in the course of the speech there are opportunities to digress
            for the sake of amplification, when some point has been proved or refuted. Amplification
            is, then, a more impressive affirmation, so to speak, which by moving the mind wins
            belief in speaking;" 8. 27: "Although Amplification has its own proper place, often in
            the opening of a<pb n="147"/> speech, and almost always at the end, yet it is to be used
            also in other parts of the discourse, especially when a point has been proved or

        taken from authority, when we call to mind of what great concern the matter under discussion
        has been to the immortal gods, or to our ancestors, or kings, states, barbarous nations,
        sages, the Senate; and again, especially how sanction has been provided in these matters by
        laws. (2) The second commonplace<note type="footnote" n="c">c Cf. Cicero, De Inv. 1. liii.
            101.</note> is used when we consider who are affected by these acts on which our charge
        rests; whether all men, which is a most shocking thing; or our superiors, such as are those </p>

    <pb n="149"/>
    <p> from whom the commonplace of authority is taken; or our peers, those in the same situation

            circumstances;<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a Cf. 3. vi. 10 below.</note>
        or our inferiors, whom in all these respects we excel. (3) By means of the third
            commonplace<note type="footnote" n="b" place="opposite">b Cf. Cicero, De Inv. 1. liii.
            101 and 2. xxxii. 100; the locus qui efficitur ex causis in Top. 18. 67.</note> we ask
        what would happen if the same indulgence should be granted to all culprits, and show what
        perils and disadvantages would ensue from indifference to this crime. (4) By means of the
        fourth commonplace<note type="footnote" n="c" place="opposite">c Cf. Cicero, De Inv. 1.
            liii. 102; Rhet. ad Alex., ch. 4 (1427 a).</note> we show that if we indulge this man,
        many others will be the more emboldened to commit crimes—something which the anticipation of
        a judicial sentence has hitherto checked. (5) By the fifth commonplace<note type="footnote"
            n="d" place="opposite">d Cf. Cicero, De Inv. 1. liii. 102.</note> we show that if once
        judgement is pronounced otherwise than as we urge, there will be nothing which can remedy
        the harm or correct the jurors' error. Here it will be in point for us to make a comparison
        with other mistakes, so as to show that other mistakes can either be moderated by time or
        corrected designedly, but that so far as the present mistake is concerned, nothing will
        serve either to alleviate or to amend it. <note type="margin" n="49">49</note> (6) By means of the sixth
        commonplace d we show that the act was done with premeditation, and declare that for an
        intentional crime there is no excuse, although a rightful plea of mercy is provided for an
        unpremeditated act. (7) By means of the seventh commonplace d we show that it is a foul
        crime, cruel, sacrilegious, and tyrannical; such a crime as the outraging of women, or one
        of those crimes that incite wars and life-and-death struggles with enemies of the state. </p>

    <pb n="151"/>
    <p> (8) By means of the eighth commonplace<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a Cf.
            Cicero, De Inv. 1. liv. 103.</note> we show that it is not a common but a unique crime,
        base, nefarious, and unheard-of, and therefore must be the more promptly and drastically
        avenged. (9) The ninth commonplace consists of a comparison<note type="footnote" n="b"
            place="opposite">b ἀντιπαραβολή. See the example of the grand style, 4. viii. 12 below,
            for a use of this commonplace. Cf. Quintilian, 6. 2. 21: " For some things are heinous
            in themselves, such as parricide, murder, poisoning, but other things have to be made to
            seem heinous; " and Cicero, De Inv. 1. liv. 104.</note> of wrongs, as when we shall say
        it is a more heinous crime to debauch a free-born person than to steal a sacred object,
        because the one is done from unbridled licentiousness and the other from need. (10) By the
        tenth commonplace we shall examine sharply, incriminatingly, and precisely, everything that
        took place in the actual execution of the deed and all the circumstances that usually attend
        such an act, so that by the enumeration of the attendant circumstances the crime may seem to

            Deliberative<note type="footnote" n="g">g See note on the epideictic kind, 3. vi. 10
            below.</note> speeches are either of the kind in which the question concerns a choice
        between two courses of action, or of the kind in which a choice among several is considered.
        An example of a </p>


    <pb n="159"/>
    <p> choice between two courses of action: Does it seem better to destroy Carthage, or to leave
        her standing?<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a Cato the Elder and Publius
            Scipio Nasica always ended their speeches, on no matter what question, the one with " In
            my opinion, Carthage must be destroyed," and the other with " In my opinion, Carthage
            must be spared "; see Plutarch, Marcus Cato 27 (352), and Appian, Pun. 8 (1). 10. 69.
            This suasoria was common among the rhetoricians; cf. Cicero, De Inv. 1. viii. 11 and 1.
            xii. 17.</note> An example of a choice among several: If Hannibal, when recalled to
        Carthage from Italy, should deliberate whether to remain in Italy, or return home, or invade
        Egypt and seize Alexandria.<note type="footnote" n="b" place="opposite">b When, in 203 B.C,
            the Carthaginians were in danger from Scipio, they summoned Hannibal to Africa. Appian,
            Hann. 7. 9. 58, reports Hannibal's fear of the perfidy and ingratitude of his
            countrymen. Alexandria, once captured, might have appeared to him as a safe refuge from
            the Romans and his enemies at home. Egypt had been weakened by the war with Antiochus
            the Great. The deliberations are not referred to in any historical account that has come
            down to us; the source may have been L. Coelius Antipater.</note> Again, a question
        under deliberation is sometimes to be examined on its own account; for example, if the
        Senate should deliberate whether or not to redeem the captives from the enemy.<note
            type="footnote" n="c" place="opposite">c A suasoria referring to the aftermath of Cannae
            in 216 B.C, as described in Livy 22. 60 ff. Some wished to ransom<pb n="159"/> the
            prisoners at public cost; others opposed the disbursement of money by the state, but not
            ransoming at the expense of individuals, and would have granted, on surety, loans from
            the treasury to those who needed money. T. Manlius Torquatus spoke against the proposal,
            which failed. This suasoria was popular with the rhetoricians; cf. Cicero, De Oratore 3.
            28. 109, De Offic. 1. 13. 40 and 3. 32. 113.</note> Or sometimes a question becomes one
        for deliberation and inquiry on account of some motive extraneous to the question itself;
        for example, if the Senate should deliberate whether to exempt Scipio from the law so as to
        permit him to become consul while under age.<note type="footnote" n="d">d Although Scipio
            Aemilianus was in fact seeking the aedileship, and not the consulship, for 147 B.C, he
            was exempted from the law requiring a candidate for the consulship to have been praetor
            (and at least two years previously); at 36 (or 37) he was also well under the age
            required (in Cicero's day 43 years) for holding the consulship. He was elected consul in
            order to deal with Carthage. Our author's consistent rule is to refer to the younger
            Scipio simply as Scipio (see also 4. v. 7, 4. xiii. 19, and 4. xxxii. 43 below) and to
            the elder as Africanus (see 4. xv. 22, 4. xxv. 34, and 4. xxxi. 42).</note> And
        sometimes a question comes under deliberation on its own account and then provokes debate
        even more because of an extraneous motive; for example, if in the Italic War the Senate
        should deliberate </p>


    <pb n="161"/>
    <p> whether or not to grant citizenship to the Allies.<note type="footnote" n="a"
            place="opposite">a When examined on its own account, this question might, for example,
            be considered as involving a radical change in Roman institutions; a motive " extraneous
            " to the question itself might be the effect of the measure upon other allies now
            threatening defection. In 90 B.C, L. Julius Caesar put through his law offering full
            Roman citizenship to all corporate communities in Italy that had not revolted; in the
            next year the lex Plautia-Papiria was passed, granting citizenship to any individual who
            (a) belonged to a city of Italy allied with Rome, and (b) resided permanently in Italy,
            and (c) applied for citizenship within sixty days.</note> In causes in which the subject
        of itself engenders the deliberation, the entire discourse will be devoted to the subject
        itself. In those in which an extraneous motive gives rise to the deliberation, it is this
        motive which will have to be emphasized or depreciated. <note type="margin" n="3">3</note> The orator

        Advantage in political deliberation has two aspects: Security<note type="footnote" n="d">d

            Advantage, but Cicero in De Inv. 2. li. 156 sets forth Honour and Advantage as
            coordinate aims, and Antonius in De Oratore 2. 82. 335 considers the situation in which
            Advantage and Honour oppose each other. The Stoics believed a conflict between Honour
            and Advantage to be impossible; see Cicero, De Offic. 3. 2. 9 ff. Perhaps because of
            Stoic influence, Cicero makes Advantage the sole aim in Part. Orat. 24. 83.</note> To
        consider Security is to provide some plan or other for ensuring the avoidance of a present
        or imminent danger. Subheads under Security are Might and Craft, which we shall consider
        either separately or conjointly. Might is determined by armies, fleets, arms, engines of
        war, recruiting of man power, and the like. Craft is exercised by means of money, promises,

        of the other; if we urge a course in a field in which we </p>


    <pb n="165"/>
    <p> have a technical knowledge of the ways and means whereby each detail should be carried out;
        or if we recommend some policy in a matter whose history we can recall either from direct
        experience or hearsay—in this instance we can easily persuade our hearers to the course we
        wish by adducing the precedent. We shall be using the topics of Justice if we say that we
        ought to pity innocent persons and suppliants; if we. show that it is proper to repay the
        well-deserving with gratitude; if we explain that we ought to punish the guilty; if we urge
        that faith ought zealously to be kept; if we say that the laws and customs<note

        we maintain that ties of hospitality, clientage, kinship, and relationship by marriage must
        inviolably be cherished; if we show that neither reward nor favour nor peril nor animosity
        ought to lead us astray from the right path; if we say that in all cases a principle of
        dealing alike with all should be established. With these and like topics of Justice we shall
        demonstrate that an action of which we are sponsors in Assembly or council is just, and by
        their contraries we shall demonstrate that an action is unjust. As a result we shall be

    <p> actions, and that, by the same token, actions base and unworthy of the brave ought therefore
        to be despised by brave men and considered as beneath their dignity. Again, from an
        honourable act no peril or toil, however great, should divert us; death ought to be
        preferred to disgrace; no pain should force an abandonment of duty; no man's enmity should
        be feared in defence of truth; for country, for parents, guest-friends, intimates, and for
        the things justice commands us to respect, it behoves us to brave any peril and endure any
        toil. We shall be using the topics of Temperance if we censure the inordinate desire for
        office, money, or the like; if we restrict each thing to its definite natural bounds; if we
        show how much is enough in each case, advise against going too far, and set the due limit to
        every matter. <note type="margin" n="6">6</note> Virtues of this kind are to be enlarged upon if we are

        points which I have made above<note type="footnote" n="a">a 3. iii. 4-5.</note> will be
        belittled. To be sure, no one will propose the abandonment of virtue, but let the speaker
        say that the affair is not of such a sort that we can put any extraordinary virtue to the
        test; or that the virtue consists rather of qualities contrary to those here evinced. Again,
        if it is at all possible, we shall show that what our opponent calls justice is cowardice,
        and sloth, and perverse generosity; what he has called wisdom we shall term impertinent,
        babbling, and offensive cleverness; what he declares to be temperance we shall declare to be

        the time of the event and afterwards. I have separated the Praiseworthy from the Right, not
        because the four categories which I list under the appellative Right usually fail to
        engender this honourable remembrance, but because, although the praiseworthy has its source
        in the right, we must nevertheless in speaking treat one apart from the other. Indeed we
        should pursue the right not alone for the sake of praise; but if praise accrues, the desire
        to strive after the right is doubled. When, therefore, a thing is shown to be right, we
        shall show that it is also praiseworthy, whether in the opinion of qualified persons (if,
        for example, something should please a more honourable class of men, and be disapproved by a
        lower class), or of certain allies, or all our fellow-citizens, or foreign nations, or our
        descendants. Such being the division of topics in deliberative speaking, I must briefly
        explain how to develop the cause as a whole. The Introduction may be made by means of the
        Direct Opening or of the Subtle Approach, or by the same means as in a judicial cause. If
        there happens to be a Statement of Facts, the same method will properly be followed in the
        narrative. <note type="margin" n="8">8</note> Since in causes of this kind the end is Advantage, and
        Advantage is divided into the consideration of Security and the consideration of Honour, if
        we can prove that both ends will be served, we shall promise </p>


    <pb n="171"/>
    <p> to make this twofold proof in our discourse; if we are going to prove that one of the two
        will be served, we shall indicate simply the one thing we intend to affirm. If, now, we say
        that our aim is Security, we shall use its subdivisions. Might and Strategy. For that which,
        in instructing, I have, in order to give clarity and emphasis, called Craft, we shall in
        speaking call by the more honourable name of Strategy. If we say that our counsel aims at
        the Right, and all four categories of Right apply, we shall use them all. If these
        categories do not all apply, we shall in speaking set forth as many as do. We shall use
        Proof and Refutation when we establish in our favour the topics explained above, and refute
        the contrary topics. The rules for developing an argument artistically will be found in Book
            II.<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a 2. xviii. 28 ff.</note> <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>V. But if it
        happens that in a deliberation the counsel of one side is based on the consideration of
        security and that of the other on honour, as in the case of those who, surrounded by
        Carthaginians, deliberate on a course of action,<note type="footnote" n="b">b A suasoria

        who advocates security will use the following topics: Nothing is more useful than safety; no
        one can make use of his virtues if he has not based his plans upon safety; not even the gods

        neither immortality nor a life everlasting is achieved, nor is it proved that, once this

        death; fortune, too, habitually favours the brave;<note type="footnote" n="a"

        except that here especially it is useful to present examples from the past in the greatest
        possible number. 10 <note type="margin" n="10">10</note> <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>VI. Let us now turn to the Epideictic kind of
            cause.<note type="footnote" n="b" place="opposite">b Cf. Cicero, De Inv. 2. lix. 177-8.
            The epideictic kind, like the deliberative (3. ii. 2-v. 9 above), receives only a
            sketchy treatment from our author—evidence of the dominant position which the judicial
            kind, with its status system, held in Hellenistic rhetoric. Despite the Epicurean notion
            that only epideictic was amenable to rules, the judicial kind was in fact the easiest to
            systematize, even as it was by far the most often employed in Hellenistic times. The
            Greek term " epideictic " did not primarily emphasize the speaker's virtuosity, nor was
            the Latin equivalent demonstrativum intended to imply logical demonstration. Whereas in
                both<pb n="173"/> deliberative and judicial causes the speaker seeks to persuade his
            hearers to a course of action, in epideictic his primary purpose is by means of his art
            to impress his ideas upon them, without action as a goal. On the scope and purpose of
            epideictic, and on the discrepancies between our author's treatment and that of
            Aristotle (Rhet. 1. 3, 1358 b), see D. A. G. Hinks, Class. Quart. 30 (1936). 170-6; cf.
            also Quintilian, 3. 4. 1 ff., and Volkmann, pp. 19 ff. In the Stoic scheme " encomiastic
            " was used instead of " epideictic "; see Diogenes Laertius 7. 42. This term, for which
            laudativum (see Cicero, Part. Orat. 3. 10, and Quintilian, 3. 3. 14, 3. 4. 12) would be
            the Latin equivalent, actually corresponds more closely to our author's definition of
            the genus than does demonstrativum. Doxapatres (Rabe, Proleg. Syll., pp. 149 ff.) argues
            for the primacy of the deliberative kind, setting the judicial in the second place, and
            the epideictic (panegyric) last; cf. Isocrates, Paneg. 4, Antid. 46 ff., Panath. 271.

        Since epideictic includes Praise and Censure, the topics on which praise is founded will, by
        their contraries, serve us as the bases for censure. The following, then, can be subject to

    <p> From our own person: if we speak in praise, we shall say that we are doing so from a sense
        of duty, because ties of friendship exist; or from goodwill, because such is the virtue of
        the person under discussion that every one should wish to call it to mind; or because it is
        appropriate to show, from the praise accorded him by others, what his character is.<note

        from goodwill, because we think it useful that all men should be apprised of a wickedness
        and a worthlessness without parallel; or because it is pleasing to show by our censure of
        others what conduct is pleasing to ourselves. When we draw our Introduction from the person

        shall, as obviously we can by the change of a few words, and as I have demonstrated just
        above, express sentiments to the contrary effect. <note type="margin" n="12">12</note> When the
        Introduction is drawn from the person of the hearers: if we speak in praise, we shall say
        that since we are not delivering an encomium amongst people unacquainted with the man, we
        shall speak but briefly, to refresh their memories; or if they do not know him, we shall try
        to make them desire to know a man of such excellence; since the hearers of our eulogy have
        the same zeal for virtue as the subject of the eulogy had or now has, we hope easily to win
        the approval of his deeds from those whose approval we desire. The opposite, if it is

        worthlessness: but if they do not, we shall try to make them know him, in order that they
        may avoid his wickedness; since our hearers are unlike the subject of our censure, we
        express the hope that they will vigorously disapprove his way of life. When the Introduction
        is drawn from the subject-matter itself: we shall say that we do not know what to praise in
        particular; we fear that in discussing a number of things we shall pass by even more; and
        add whatever will carry like sentiments. The sentiments opposite to these are drawn upon. if
        we censure. <note type="margin" n="13">13</note> <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>VII. If the Introduction has been developed in
        accordance with any of the methods just mentioned, there will be no need for a Statement of
        Facts to follow it; but if there is occasion for one, when we must recount with either
        praise or censure some deed of the person discussed, the instructions for Stating the Facts
        will be found in Book I.<note type="footnote" n="a">a 1. viii. 12-ix. 16.</note> The
        Division we shall make is the following: we shall set forth the things we intend to praise
        or censure; then recount the events, observing their precise sequence and chronology, so
        that one may understand what the person under discussion did and with what prudence and
        caution. But it will first be necessary to set forth his virtues or faults of character, and
        then to explain how. such being his character, he has used the advantages or disadvantages,
        physical or of external circumstances. The following is the order we must keep when
        portraying a life: </p>



    <pb n="181"/>
    <p> (1) External Circumstances: Descent—in praise: the ancestors of whom he is sprung; if he is
        of illustrious descent, he has been their peer or superior; if of humble descent, he has had
        his support, not in the virtues of his ancestors, but in his own. In censure: if he is of
        illustrious descent, he has been a disgrace to his forebears; if of low descent, he is none
        the less a dishonour even to these. Education—in praise: that he was well and honourably
        trained in worthy studies throughout his boyhood. In censure: . . . <note type="margin" n="14">14</note>
        (2) Next we must pass to the Physical Advantages: if by nature he has impressiveness and
        beauty, these have served him to his credit, and not, as in the case of others, to his
        detriment and shame; if he has exceptional strength and agility, we shall point out that
        these were acquired by worthy and diligent exercise; if he has continual good health, that
        was acquired by care and by control over his passions. In censure, if the subject has these
        physical advantages, we shall declare that he has abused what, like the meanest gladiator,
        he has had by chance and nature. If he lacks them, we shall say that to his own fault and
        want of self-control is his lack of every physical advantage, beauty apart, attributable.
        (3) Then we shall return to External Circumstances and consider his virtues and defects of
        Character evinced with respect to these: Has he been rich or poor? What kinds of power has
        he wielded? What have been his titles to fame? What his friendships? Or what his private
        feuds, and what act of bravery has he performed in conducting these feuds? With what motive
        has he entered into feuds? With what loyalty, goodwill, and sense of duty has he </p>




    <pb n="183"/>
    <p> conducted his friendships? What character of man has he been in wealth, or in poverty? What
        has been his attitude in the exercise of his prerogatives? If he is dead, what sort of death
        did he die,<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a If a noble death,
            εὐθανασία.</note> and what <note type="margin" n="15">15</note> sort of consequences followed upon
        it? <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>VIII. In all circumstances, moreover, in which human character is chiefly studied, those
        four above-mentioned virtues of character will have to be applied. Thus, if we speak in
        praise, we shall say that one act was just, another courageous, another temperate, and
        another wise; if we speak in censure, we shall declare that one was unjust, another
        intemperate, another cowardly, and another stupid. From this arrangement it is now no doubt
        clear how we are to treat the three categories of praise and censure—with the added proviso
        that we need not use all three for praise or for censure, because often not all of them even
        apply, and often, too, when they do, the application is so slight that it is unnecessary to
        refer to them. We shall therefore need to choose those categories which seem to provide the
        greatest force. Our Conclusions will be brief, in the form of a Summary at the end of the
        discourse; in the discourse itself we shall by means of commonplaces frequently insert brief
        amplifications. Nor should this kind of cause<note type="footnote" n="b" place="opposite">b
            I.e., the epideictic. As a progymnasma it is the type περὶ ἐγκωμίου καὶ ψέγου.</note> be
        the less strongly recommended just because it presents itself only seldom in life. Indeed
        when a task may present itself, be it only occasionally, the ability to perform it as
        skilfully as possible must seem desirable. And if epideictic is only seldom employed by
        itself independently, still in judicial and deliberative causes extensive sections are often
        devoted to praise or </p>



    <pb n="185"/>
    <p> censure. Therefore let us believe that this kind of cause also must claim some measure of
        our industry. Now that I have completed the most difficult part of rhetoric—thoroughly
        treating Invention and applying it to every kind of cause—it is time to proceed to the other
        parts. I shall therefore next<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a In the
            Peripatetic order of the officia oratoris Style followed Invention in second place,
            Arrangement being third; cf. 1. ii. 3 above, and the note on 3. i. 1.</note> discuss the
        Arrangement. <note type="margin" n="16">16</note> <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>IX. Since it is through the Arrangement<note

            first to set up a theory of Arrangement. Sulpitius Victor 14 (Halm, p. 320)
            distinguishes between the Natural Arrangement (ordo naturalis) and the Artistic (ordo
            artificiosus, οἰκονομία), the former corresponding to our author's ordo artificiosus
            (see 3. ix. 17 below), the genus ab institutione artis profectum, and<pb n="185"/> the
            latter to our author's genus ad casum temporis adcommodatum. Cf. Quintilian's oeconomica

        that we set in order the topics we have invented so that there may be a definite place for
        each in the delivery, we must see what kind of method one should follow in the process of
        arranging. The kinds of Arrangement are two: one arising from the principles of rhetoric,
        the other accommodated to particular circumstances. Our Arrangement will be based on the
        principles of rhetoric when we observe the instructions that I have set forth in Book I<note
            type="footnote" n="c">c 1. iii. 4.</note>—to use the Introduction, Statement of Facts,
        Division, Proof, Refutation, and Conclusion, and in speaking to follow the order enjoined
        above. It is likewise on the principles of the art that we shall be basing our Arrangement,
        not only of the whole case throughout the discourse, but also of the individual arguments,
        according to Proposition, Reason, Proof of the Reason, Embellishment, and Résumé, as I have
        explained in Book II.<note type="footnote" n="d">d 2. xviii. 28. Conclusio is there called
            complexio.</note>
        <note type="margin" n="17">17</note> This Arrangement, then, is twofold—one for the whole speech, and
        the other for the individual </p>

    <p> arguments—and is based upon the principles of rhetoric. But there is also another
        Arrangement, which, when we must depart from the order imposed by the rules of the art, is
        accommodated to circumstance in accordance with the speaker's judgement;<note
            type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a On the principle of " anomaly " rather than "
            analogy,”</note> for example, if we should begin our speech with the Statement of Facts,
        or with some very strong argument, or the reading of some documents; or if straightway after
        the Introduction we should use the Proof and then the Statement of Facts: or if we should
        make some other change of this kind in the order. But none of these changes ought to be made
        except when our cause demands them. For if the ears of the audience seem to have been
        deafened and their attention wearied by the wordiness of our adversaries, we can
        advantageously omit the Introduction,<note type="footnote" n="b">b But in 1. vi. 10 our
            author advises us in such circumstances to use the Subtle Approach, and to open with
            something that may provoke laughter.</note> and begin the speech with either the
        Statement of Facts or some strong argument. Then, if it is advantageous—for it is not always
        necessary-— one may recur to the idea intended for the Introduction. <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>X. If our cause seems
        to present so great a difficulty that no one can listen to the Introduction with patience,
        we shall begin with the Statement of Facts and then recur to the idea intended for the
        Introduction. If the Statement of Facts is not quite plausible, we shall begin with some
        strong argument. It is often necessary to employ such changes and transpositions when the
        cause itself obliges us to modify with art the Arrangement prescribed by the rules of the
        art. </p>


    <pb n="189"/>
    <p>
        <note type="margin" n="18">18</note> In the Proof and Refutation of arguments it is appropriate to adopt
        an Arrangement of the following sort: (1) the strongest arguments should be placed at the
        beginning and at the end of the pleading; (2) those of medium force, and also those that are
        neither useless to the discourse nor essential to the proof, which are weak if presented
        separately and individually, but become strong and plausible when conjoined with the others,
        should be placed in the middle.<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a Quintilian, 5.
            12. 14, calls this the Homeric disposition, from Il. 4. 297-9: " And first he [Nestor]
            arrayed the horsemen with horses and chariots, and behind them the foot-soldiers, many
            and valiant, to be a bulwark of battle. But the weaklings he drove into the midst." Cf.
            also Longinus, in Spengel-Hammer 1 (2). 185. 16 ff.</note> For immediately after the
        facts have been stated the hearer waits to see whether the cause can by some means be
        proved, and that is why we ought straightway to present some strong argument. (3) And as for
        the rest, since what has been said last is easily committed to memory, it is useful, when
        ceasing to speak, to leave some very strong argument fresh in the hearer's mind. This
        arrangement of topies in speaking, like the arraying of soldiers in battle, can readily
        bring victory. <note type="margin" n="19">19</note> <milestone unit="section" n="11"/>XI Many have said that the faculty of greatest use

            to be the dominant element in oratory; " 11. 3. 5-6: " For my part I would affirm that a
            mediocre speech supported by all the power of delivery will have more force than the
            best speech devoid of that power. That is why Demosthenes, asked what was primary in the
            whole task of oratory, gave the palm to delivery, and gave it second and third place as
            well. ... So that we may assume that he thought it to be not merely the first, but the
            only virtue of oratory " (cf. also Philodemus, Rhet., ed. Sudhaus, 1. 196; Cicero,
            Brutus 37.<pb n="190"/> 142, Orator 17.56; Plutarch, Vitae Dec. Orat. 845 B; Longinus,

            following Theophrastus; Athanasius (Rabe, Proleg. Syll., p. 177) says that to
            Theophrastus " the most important thing for persuasion in rhetoric is delivery." Cf.
            Philodemus, Rhet., ed. Sudhaus 1. 193 (I use Gomperz' restoration): " Of the six, or as
            some hold, seven parts of rhetoric, Athenaeus [second century B.C] said that the most
            important is delivery; " Longinus, in Spengel-Hammer 1 (2). 194: " Delivery is of
            greatest importance for proof." Thrasymachus maintained that delivery is given us by
            nature, not by art (Quintilian, 3. 3. 4).</note> For </p>


    <pb n="191"/>
    <p> skilful invention, elegant style, the artistic arrangement of the parts comprising the case,
        and the careful memory of all these will be of no more value without delivery, than delivery
        alone and independent of these. Therefore, because no one has written carefully on this
            subject<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a Diogenes Laertius, 5. 48, lists a
            work on delivery by Theophrastus. L. Plotius Gallus, friend of Marius, wrote about
            Gesture as practised in his day (Quintilian, 11. 3. 143); whether this work antedated
            our treatise we do not know. Theophrastus was probably the first to make Delivery a<pb

        for voice, mien, and gesture to be lucidly described, as appertaining to our
        sense-experience— and because the mastery of delivery is a very important requisite for

    <pb n="193"/>
    <p> Stability is primarily gained by cultivation; declamatory exercise augments it somewhat, but
        chiefly conserves it. Vocal flexibility—the ability in speaking to vary the intonations of
        the voice at pleasure— is primarily achieved by declamatory exercise.<note type="footnote"
            n="a" place="opposite">a Note that these references to declamatio, the earliest in
            extant Latin literature, appear in connection with delivery. Declamatio = probably

            Liverpool, 1949, p. 20, note 3.</note> Thus with regard to vocal volume, and in a degree
        also to stability, since one is the gift of nature and the other is acquired by cultivation,
        it is pointless to give any other advice than that the method of cultivating the voice
        should be sought from those skilled in this art.<note type="footnote" n="b" place="opposite"

        that I must discuss stability in the degree that it is conserved by a system of declamation,
        and also vocal flexibility (this is especially necessary to the speaker), because it too is
        acquired by the discipline of declamation. <note type="margin" n="21">21</note> We can, then, in
        speaking conserve stability mainly by using for the Introduction a voice as cairn and
        composed as possible. For the windpipe is injured if filled with a violent outburst of sound
        before it has been soothed by soft intonations. And it is appropriate to use rather long
        pauses—the voice is refreshed by respiration and the windpipe is rested by silence. We
        should also relax from continual use of the full voice and pass to the tone of conversation;
        for, as the result of changes, no one kind of tone is spent, and we are complete in the
        entire range. Again, we ought to avoid piercing exclamations, for a shock that wounds the
        windpipe is produced by shouting which is excessively sharp and shrill,<note type="footnote"
            n="c">c The Rhodian school opposed the overloud delivery of the Asiatic orators.</note>
        and the brilliance of the voice is altogether used up by one outburst. Again, at the end of
        the speech it is proper to deliver long periods in one unbroken </p>

            34.</note> for then the throat becomes warm, the windpipe is filled, and the voice,
        which has been used in a variety of tones, is restored to a kind of uniform and constant
        tone. How often must we be duly thankful to nature, as here! Indeed what we declare to be
        beneficial for conserving the voice applies also to agreeableness of delivery, and, as a
        result, what benefits our voice likewise finds favour in the hearer's taste. <note type="margin" n="22"
            >22</note> A useful thing for stability is a calm tone in the Introduction.<note

        voice in the Introduction to a discourse? Pauses strengthen the voice. They also render the
        thoughts more clear-cut by separating them, and leave the hearer time to think. Relaxation
        from a continuous full tone conserves the voice, and the variety gives extreme pleasure to
        the hearer too, since now the conversational tone holds the attention and now the full voice
        rouses it. Sharp exclamation injures the voice and likewise jars the hearer, for it has
        about it something ignoble, suited rather to feminine outcry than to manly dignity in
        speaking. At the end of the speech a sustained flow is beneficial to the voice. And does not
        this, too, most vigorously stir the hearer at the Conclusion of the entire discourse? Since,
        then, the same means serve the stability of the voice and agreeableness of delivery, my
        present discussion will have dealt with both at once, offering as it does the observations
        that have seemed appropriate on stability, and the related observations on agreeableness.

        on rhetorical rules, deserves our more careful consideration. The aspects of Flexibility are
        Conversational Tone, Tone of Debate, and Tone of Amplification. The Tone of Conversation is
            relaxed,<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a ἀνειμένη.</note> and is closest
        to daily speech. The Tone of Debate is energetic, and is suited to both proof and
            refutation.<note type="footnote" n="b" place="opposite">b Contentio (ἐναγώνιος λόγος)
            represents the impassioned, vehement address of formal debate, sermo the informal
            language of ordinary conversation (Cicero, De Offic. 1. 37. 132: sermo in circulis,
            disputationibus, congressionibus familiarium versetur, sequatur etiam convivia). Our
            author's treatment seems to have a Peripatetic cast; see Aristotle, Rhet. 3. 12 (1413
            b). Cf. Cicero, l.c. (in De Offic, Bk. 1, he follows the Stoic philosopher Panaetius): "
            Rules for contentio we have from the rhetoricians. There are none for sermo; yet I do
            not know why there cannot be for sermo, too."</note> The Tone of Amplification either
        rouses the hearer to wrath or moves him to Pity-Conversational tone comprises four kinds:
        the Dignified,<note type="footnote" n="c">c Cf. the definition of dignitas, 4. xiii. 18
            below.</note> the Explicative, the Narrative, and the Facetious. The Dignified, or
        Serious, Tone of Conversation is marked by some degree of impressiveness and by vocal
        restraint. The Explicative in a calm voice explains how something could or could not have
        been brought to pass. The Narrative sets forth events that have occurred or might have
            occurred.<note type="footnote" n="d">d The same definition of narratio as in 1. iii. 4

            (εὐτράπελος), and the buffoon (βωμολόχος).</note> In the Tone of Debate are
        distinguishable the Sustained and the Broken. The Sustained is full-voiced and accelerated
        delivery. The Broken Tone of Debate is punctuated repeatedly with short, intermittent
        pauses, and is vociferated sharply. <note type="margin" n="24">24</note> The Tone of Amplification
        includes the Hortatory and the Pathetic. The Hortatory, by amplifying </p>


    <pb n="199"/>
    <p> some fault, incites the hearer to indignation. The Pathetic, by amplifying misfortunes, wins
        the hearer over to pity.<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a Amplification and

            xxxix. 51 (Vivid Description) below.</note> Since, then, vocal flexibility is divided
        into three tones, and these in turn subdivide into eight others, it appears that we must
        explain what delivery is appropriate to each of these eight subdivisions. <milestone unit="section" n="14"/>XIV. (1) For the
        Dignified Conversational Tone it will be proper to use the full throat but the calmest and
        most subdued voice possible, yet not in such a fashion that we pass from the practice of the
        orator to that of the tragedian.<note type="footnote" n="b">b On the speaker's delivery as
            against the actor's see 3. xv. 26 below; Cicero, Orator 25. 86; Quintilian, 11. 3. 57,
            181 ff.</note> (2) For the Explicative Conversational Tone one ought to use a rather
        thin-toned voice, and frequent pauses and intermissions, so that we seem by means of the
        delivery itself to implant and engrave in the hearer's mind the points we are making in our
        explanation. (3) For the Narrative Conversational Tone varied intonations are necessary, so
        that we seem to recount everything just as it took place. Our delivery will be somewhat
        rapid when we narrate what we wish to show was done vigorously, and it will be slower when
        we narrate something else done in leisurely fashion. Then, corresponding to the content of
        the words, we shall modify the delivery in all the kinds of tone, now to sharpness, now to
        kindness, or now to sadness, and now to gaiety. If in the Statement of Facts there occur any
        declarations, demands, replies, or exclamations of astonishment concerning the facts we are
        narrating, we shall give careful attention to expressing with the voice the </p>


    <pb n="201"/>
    <p>
        <note type="margin" n="25">25</note> feelings and thoughts of each personage. (4) For the Facetious
        Conversational Tone, with a gentle quiver in the voice, and a slight suggestion of a smile,
        but without any trace of immoderate laughter, one ought to shift one's utterance smoothly
        from the Serious Conversational tone to the tone of gentlemanly jest. Since the Tone of
        Debate is to be expressed either through the Sustained or the Broken, when the (5) Sustained
        Tone of Debate is required, one ought moderately to increase the vocal volume, and, in
        maintaining an uninterrupted flow of words, also to bring the voice into harmony with them,
        to inflect the tone accordingly, and to deliver the words rapidly in a full voice, so that
        the voice production can follow the fluent energy of the speech. (6) For the Broken Tone of
        Debate we must with deepest chest tones produce the clearest possible exclamations, and I
        advise giving as much time to each pause as to each exclamation. For (7) the Hortatory Tone
        of Amplification we shall use a very thin-toned voice, moderate loudness, an even flow of
        sound, frequent modulations, and the utmost speed. (8) For the Pathetic Tone of
        Amplification we shall use a restrained voice, deep tone, frequent intermissions, long
        pauses, and marked changes. <milestone unit="section" n="15"/>XV. On Voice Quality enough has been said. Now it seems best to
        discuss Physical Movement. <note type="margin" n="26">26</note> Physical movement<note type="footnote"

        which renders what is delivered more plausible. Accordingly the facial expression should
        show modesty and animation, and the gestures should not be conspicuous for either elegance

            Gellius 1. 5.</note> lest we give the impression that we are either actors or day
        labourers. It seems, then, that the rules regulating bodily movement ought to correspond to
        the several divisions of tone comprising voice. To illustrate: (1) For the Dignified
        Conversational Tone, the speaker must stay in position when he speaks, lightly moving his
        right hand, his countenance expressing an emotion corresponding to the sentiments of the
        subject—gaiety or sadness or an emotion intermediate. (2) For the Explicative Conversational
        Tone, we shall incline the body forward a little from the shoulders, since it is natural to
        bring the face as close as possible to our hearers when we wish to prove a point and arouse
        them vigorously. (3) For the Narrative Conversational Tone, the same physical movement as I
        have just set forth for the Dignified will be appropriate. (4) For the Facetious
        Conversational Tone, we should by our countenance express a certain gaiety, without changing
        gestures. <note type="margin" n="27">27</note> (5) For the Sustained Tone of Debate, we shall use a
        quick gesture of the arm, a mobile countenance, and a keen glance. (6) For the Broken Tone
        of Debate, one must extend the arm very quickly, walk up and down, occasionally stamp the
        right foot, and adopt a keen and fixed look. (7) For the Hortatory Tone of Amplification, it
        will be appropriate to use a somewhat slower and more deliberate gesticulation, but
        otherwise to follow the procedure for the Sustained Tone of Debate. (8) For the Pathetic

        uniform gesticulation and a sad and disturbed expression. I am not unaware how great a task
        I have undertaken in trying to express physical movements in words and portray vocal
        intonations in writing. True, I was not confident that it was possible to treat these
        matters adequately in writing. Yet neither did I suppose that, if such a treatment were
        impossible, it would follow that what I have done here would be useless, for it has been my
        purpose merely to suggest what ought to be done. The rest I shall leave to practice. This,
        nevertheless, one must remember: good delivery ensures that what the orator is saying seems
        to come from his heart. <note type="margin" n="28">28</note> <milestone unit="section" n="16"/>XVI. Now let me turn to the treasure-house
        of the ideas supplied by Invention, to the guardian of all the parts of rhetoric, the
            Memory.<note type="footnote" n="b" place="opposite">b On ancient mnemonics see Helga
            Hajdu, Das mnemotechnische Schrifttum des Mittelalters (Vienna, Amsterdam, and Leipzig,

            465-493. The rhetorical interest in memoria appears early, among the sophists, who
            valued its uses in the learning of commonplaces and for improvisation. Our author's
            mnemonic system is the oldest extant. Whether such pictorial methods were widely used by
            the orators we do not know, but the theory persists to this day. See also Longinus, in
            Spengel-Hammer 1 (2). 197-206; Cicero, De Oratore 2. 85. 350-88. 360; and esp.

        more favourable, opportunity to discuss. At present I shall accept as proved that in this
        matter art and method are of great importance, and shall treat the subject accordingly. For
        my part, I am </p>


    <pb n="207"/>
    <p> satisfied that there is an art of memory—the grounds of my belief I shall explain
            elsewhere.<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a Whether our author ever
            published such an explanation we do not know. See notes on 3. ii. 3 and 4. xii.
            17.</note> For the present I shall disclose what sort of thing memory is. There are,
        then, two kinds of memory: one natural, and the other the product of art. The natural memory
        is that memory which is imbedded in our minds, born simultaneously with thought. The
        artificial memory is that memory which is strengthened by a kind of training and system of
        discipline. But just as in everything else the merit of natural excellence often rivals
        acquired learning, and art, in its turn, reinforces and develops the natural
            advantages,<note type="footnote" n="b" place="opposite">b For the commonplace cf.
            Isocrates, Adv. Soph. 14 ff., Antid. 189 ff.; Plato, Phaedrus 269 D; Cicero, Pro Archia

        memory, if a person is <note type="margin" n="29">29</note> endowed with an exceptional one, is often
        like this artificial memory, and this artificial memory, in its turn, retains and develops
        the natural advantages by a method of discipline. Thus the natural memory must be
        strengthened by discipline so as to become exceptional, and, on the other hand, this memory
        provided by discipline requires natural ability. It is neither more nor less true in this
        instance than in the other arts that science thrives by the aid of innate ability, and
        nature by the aid of the rules of art. The training here offered will therefore also be
        useful to those who by nature have a good memory, as you will yourself soon come to
            understand.<note type="footnote" n="c">c Cf. 3. xxii. 36 below.</note> But even if
        these, relying on their natural talent, did not need our help, we should still be justified
        in wishing to aid the less well-endowed. Now I shall discuss the artificial memory. </p>


    <pb n="209"/>
    <p> The artificial memory includes backgrounds and images. By backgrounds I mean such scenes as
        are naturally or artificially set off on a small scale, complete and conspicuous, so that we
        can grasp and embrace them easily by the natural memory—for example, a house, an
        intercolumnar space, a recess, an arch, or the like. An image is, as it were, a figure,
        mark, or portrait of the object we wish to remember; for example, if we wish to recall a
        horse, a lion, or an eagle, we must place its image in a definite back-<note type="margin" n="30"
            >30</note> ground. Now I shall show what kind of backgrounds we should invent and how we
        should discover the images and set them therein. <milestone unit="section" n="17"/>XVII. Those who know the letters of the
        alphabet can thereby write out what is dictated to them and read aloud what they have
        written. Likewise, those who have learned mnemonics can set in backgrounds what they have
        heard, and from these backgrounds deliver it by memory. For the backgrounds are very much
        like wax tablets<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a Cf. " the table of my

        arrangement and disposition of the images like the script, and the delivery is like the
        reading. We should therefore, if we desire to memorize a large number of items, equip
        ourselves with a large number of backgrounds, so that in these we may set a large number of
        images. I likewise think it obligatory to have these backgrounds in a series, so that we may
        never by confusion in their order be prevented from following the images— </p>

        go forwards or backwards—nor from delivering orally what has been committed to the
        backgrounds. <milestone unit="section" n="18"/>XVIII. For example, if we should see a great number of our acquaintances
        standing in a certain order, it would not make any difference to us whether we should tell
        their names beginning with the person standing at the head of the line or at the foot or in
        the middle. So with respect to the backgrounds. If these have been arranged in order, the
        result will be that, reminded by the images, we can repeat orally what we have committed to
        the backgrounds, proceeding <note type="margin" n="31">31</note> in either direction from any background
        we please. That is why it also seems best to arrange the backgrounds in a series. We shall
        need to study with special care the backgrounds we have adopted so that they may cling
        lastingly in our memory, for the images, like letters, are effaced when we make no use of
        them, but the backgrounds, like wax tablets, should abide. And that we may by no chance err
        in the number of backgrounds, each fifth background should be marked. For example, if in the
        fifth we should set a golden hand, and in the tenth some acquaintance whose first name is
        Decimus, it will then be easy to station like marks in each successive fifth background.
        <milestone unit="section" n="19"/>XIX. Again, it will be more advantageous to obtain backgrounds in a deserted than in a
        populous region, because the crowding and passing to and fro of people confuse and weaken
        the impress of the images, while solitude keeps their outlines sharp. Further, backgrounds
        differing in form and nature must be secured, so that, thus distinguished, they </p>





    <pb n="213"/>
    <p> may be clearly visible; for if a person has adopted many intercolumnar spaces, their
        resemblance to one another will so confuse him that he will no longer know what he has set
        in each background. And these backgrounds ought to be of moderate size and medium extent,
        for when excessively large they render the images vague, and when too small often seem
        incapable of receiving an arrangement of <note type="margin" n="32">32</note> images. Then the
        backgrounds ought to be neither too bright nor too dim, so that the shadows may not obscure
        the images nor the lustre make them glitter. I believe that the intervals between
        backgrounds should be of moderate extent, approximately thirty feet; for, like the external
        eye, so the inner eye of thought is less powerful when you have moved the object of sight
        too near or too far away. Although it is easy for a person with a relatively large
        experience to equip himself with as many and as suitable backgrounds as he may desire, even
        a person who believes that he finds no store of backgrounds that are good enough, may
        succeed in fashioning as many such as he wishes. For the imagination can embrace any region
        whatsoever and in it at will fashion and construct the setting of some background. Hence, if
        we are not content with our ready-made supply of backgrounds, we may in our imagination
        create a region for ourselves and obtain a most serviceable distribution of appropriate
        backgrounds. On the subject of backgrounds enough has been said; let me now turn to the
        theory of images. <note type="margin" n="33">33</note> <milestone unit="section" n="20"/>XX. Since, then, images must resemble objects, we
        ought ourselves to choose from all objects likenesses for our use. Hence likenesses are
        bound to </p>



    <pb n="215"/>

            memoria embraces the speaker's command of his material as well as of the words.</note>
        the other of words. Likenesses of matter are formed when we enlist images that present a
        general view of the matter with which we are dealing; likenesses of words are established
        when the record of each single noun or appellative is kept by an image. Often we encompass
        the record of an entire matter by one notation, a single image. For example, the prosecutor
        has said that the defendant killed a man by poison, has charged that the motive for the
        crime was an inheritance, and declared that there are many witnesses and accessories to this
        act. If in order to facilitate our defence we wish to remember this first point, we shall in
        our first background form an image of the whole matter. We shall picture the man in question
        as lying ill in bed, if we know his person. If we do not know him, we shall yet take some
        one to be our invalid, but not a man of the lowest class, so that he may come to mind at
        once. And we shall place the defendant at the bedside, holding in his right hand a cup, and
        in his left tablets, and on the fourth finger<note type="footnote" n="b" place="opposite">b
            According to Macrobius, Sat. 7. 13. 7-8, the anatomists spoke of a nerve which extends
            from the heart to the fourth finger of the left hand (the digitus medicinalis), where it
            interlaces into the other nerves of that finger; the finger was therefore ringed, as
            with a crown. Testiculi suggests testes<pb n="215"/> (witnesses). Of the scrotum of the
            ram purses were made; thus the money used for bribing the witnesses may perhaps also be

        the inheritance, and <note type="margin" n="34">34</note> the witnesses. In like fashion we shall set
        the other counts of the charge in backgrounds successively, following their order, and
        whenever we wish to remember a point, by properly arranging the patterns of the
            backgrounds<note type="footnote" n="c">c At 3. xvi. 29 above formae is used to describe
            the images.</note> and carefully imprinting the images, we shall easily succeed in
        calling back to mind what we wish. </p>

    <p> <milestone unit="section" n="21"/>XXI. When we wish to represent by images the likenesses of words, we shall be undertaking a
        greater task and exercising our ingenuity the more. This we ought to effect in the following
        way: Iam domum itionem reges Atridae parant.<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a
            An iambic senarius, whether our author's own creation or from a tragedy by an unknown
            author (the Iphigenia mentioned below?) is uncertain. Note that here the play is upon
            the form of the word, not its meaning, and that no special provision is made for the
            adverb iam. Quintilian, 11. 2. 25, doubts the efficacy of symbols to record a series of
            connected words: " I do not mention the fact that some things, certainly conjunctions,
            for example, cannot be represented by images."</note> " And now their home-coming the
        kings, the sons of Atreus, are making ready." If we wish to remember this verse, in our
        first background we should put Domitius, raising hands to heaven while he is lashed by the
        Marcii Reges<note type="footnote" n="b">b The scene is doubtless our author's own creation.
            Rex was the name of one of the most distinguished families of the Marcian gens; the

        represent " Iam domum itionem reges " ("And now their home-coming the kings,"); in the
        second background, Aesopus and Cimber,<note type="footnote" n="c">c Clodius Aesopus (a

        will represent " Atridae parant” (“the sons of Atreus, are making ready”). By this method
        all the words will be represented. But such an arrangement of images succeeds only if we use
        our notation to stimulate the natural memory, so that we first go over a given verse twice
        or three times to ourselves and then represent the words by means of images. In this way art
        will supplement nature. For neither by itself will be strong enough, though we must note
        that theory and technique are much the more reliable. I should not hesitate to </p>


    <pb n="219"/>
    <p> demonstrate this in detail, did I not fear that, once having departed from my plan, I should
        not so well preserve the clear conciseness of my instruction. <note type="margin" n="35">35</note> Now,
        since in normal cases some images are strong and sharp and suitable for awakening
        recollection, and others so weak and feeble as hardly to succeed in stimulating memory, we
        must therefore consider the cause of these differences, so that, by knowing the cause, we
        may know which images to avoid and which to seek. <milestone unit="section" n="22"/>XXII. Now nature herself teaches us what
        we should do. When we see in everyday life things that are petty, ordinary, and banal, we
        generally fail to remember them, because the mind is not being stirred by anything novel or
        marvellous. But if we see or hear something exceptionally base, dishonourable,
        extraordinary, great, unbelievable, or laughable, that we are likely to remember a long
        time. Accordingly, things immediate to our eye or ear we commonly forget; incidents of our
        childhood we often remember best.<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a Cf. Jerome,
            Apol. adv. libr. Rufini 1. 30.</note> Nor could this be so for any other reason than
        that ordinary things easily slip from the memory while the striking and novel stay longer in
            <note type="margin" n="36">36</note> mind. A sunrise, the sun's course, a sunset, are marvellous to
        no one because they occur daily.<note type="footnote" n="b">b Cf. Lucretius 2. 1037-8: " So
            wondrous would this sight have been. Yet, wearied as all are with satiety of seeing, how
            truly no one now deigns to gaze up at the bright quarters of heaven! "</note> But solar
        eclipses are a source of wonder because they occur seldom, and indeed are more marvellous
        than lunar eclipses, because these are more frequent. Thus nature shows that she is not

        and follow as she directs. For in invention nature is never last, education never first;
        rather the beginnings of things arise from natural talent, and the ends are reached by
        discipline. <note type="margin" n="37">37</note> We ought, then, to set up images of a kind that can
        adhere longest in the memory. And we shall do so if we establish likenesses as striking as
        possible; if we set up images that are not many or vague, but doing something; if we assign
        to them exceptional beauty or singular ugliness; if we dress some of them with crowns or
        purple cloaks, for example, so that the likeness may be more distinct to us; or if we
        somehow disfigure them, as by introducing one stained with blood or soiled with mud or
        smeared with red paint, so that its form is more striking, or by assigning certain comic
        effects to our images, for that, too, will ensure our remembering them more readily. The
        things we easily remember when they are real we likewise remember without difficulty when
        they are figments, if they have been carefully delineated. But this will be essential—again
        and again to run over rapidly in the mind all the original backgrounds in order to refresh
        the images. <note type="margin" n="38">38</note> <milestone unit="section" n="23"/>XXIII. I know that most of the Greeks who have written
        on the memory<note type="footnote" n="b">b Precisely who these predecessors were we do not
            know.</note> have taken the course of listing images that correspond to a great many
        words, so that persons who wished to learn these images by heart would have them ready
        without expending effort on a search for them. I disapprove of their method on several
        grounds. First, among the </p>


    <pb n="223"/>
    <p> innumerable multitude of words it is ridiculous to collect images for a thousand. How meagre
        is the value these can have, when out of the infinite store of words we shall need to
        remember now one, and now another? Secondly, why do we wish to rob anybody of his
        initiative, so that, to save him from making any search himself, we deliver to him
        everything searched out and ready? Then again, one person is more struck by one likeness,
        and another more by another. Often in fact when we declare that some one form resembles
        another, we fail to receive universal assent, because things seem different to different
        persons. The same is true with respect to images: one that is well-defined to us appears
        relatively <note type="margin" n="39">39</note> inconspicuous to others. Everybody, therefore, should in
        equipping himself with images suit his own convenience. Finally, it is the instructor's duty
        to teach the proper method of search in each ease, and, for the sake of greater clarity, to
        add in illustration some one or two examples of its kind, but not all. For instance, when I
        discuss the search for Introductions, I give a method of search and do not draught a
        thousand kinds of Introductions. The same procedure I believe should be followed with
        respect to images. <milestone unit="section" n="24"/>XXIV. Now, lest you should perchance regard the memorizing of words
        either as too difficult or as of too little use, and so rest content with the memorizing of
        matter, as being easier and more useful, I must advise you why I do not disapprove of
        memorizing words. I believe that they who wish to do easy things without trouble and toil
        must previously have been trained in more difficult things. Nor have I included memorization
        of words to enable us to get </p>


    <pb n="225"/>
    <p> verse by rote, but rather as an exercise whereby to strengthen that other kind of memory,
        the memory of matter, which is of practical use. Thus we may without effort pass from this
        difficult training to ease <note type="margin" n="40">40</note> in that other memory. In every
        discipline artistic theory is of little avail without unremitting exercise, but especially
        in mnemonics theory is almost valueless unless made good by industry, devotion, toil, and
        care. You can make sure that you have as many backgrounds as possible and that these conform
        as much as possible to the rules; in placing the images you should exercise every day. While
        an engrossing preoccupation may often distract us from our other pursuits, from this
        activity nothing whatever can divert us. Indeed there is never a moment when we do not wish
        to commit something to memory, and we wish it most of all when our attention is held by
        business of special importance. So, since a ready memory is a useful thing, you see clearly
        with what great pains we must strive to acquire so useful a faculty. Once you know its uses
        you will be able to appreciate this advice. To exhort you further in the matter of memory is
        not my intention, for I should appear either to have lacked confidence in your zeal or to
        have discussed the subject less fully than it demands. I shall next discuss the fifth part
        of rhetoric. You might rehearse in your mind each of the first four divisions, and—what is
        especially necessary—fortify your knowledge of them with exercise. </p>

        Style, and wherever there was need of examples, I have used those of my own making, and in
        so doing have departed from the practice of the Greek writers<note type="footnote" n="a"
            place="opposite">a See note on 4. v. 7 below.</note> on the subject, I must in a few
        words justify my method. And that I make this explanation from necessity, and not from
        choice, is sufficiently indicated by the fact that in the preceding Books I have said
        nothing by way either of preface<note type="footnote" n="b" place="opposite">b Cf. the long
            prefaces to the books of Cicero, De Inv.</note> or of digression. Now, after a few
        indispensable observations, I shall, as I undertook to do, discharge my task of explaining
        to you the rest of the art. But you will more readily understand my method when you have
        learned what the Greeks say.<note type="footnote" n="c" place="opposite">c The character of
            this Introduction to Book 4 (only the final argument and some of the illustrations are
            Roman) suggests a Greek origin. It reflects the debates between Greeks and Greeks—on
            Atticism as against Asianism, or the old rhetoric, based on the imitation of the
            ancients (μίμησις τῶν ἀρχαίων), as against the modern (νεωτερισμός). Hermagoras, to
            whose reliance on the ancients Cicero, De Inv. 1. vi. 8, refers, and whom Cicero in his
            Introduction to that<pb n="229"/> work attacks, was doubtless also in the author's mind.
            See Paul Wendland, Quaestiones Rhetoricae, Göttingen, 1914. As our notes show, in spite
            of the argument in this Introduction, Book 4 contains numerous examples taken (though
            often with considerable changes) from a variety of sources, both Roman and Greek.</note>

    <p> prompted by modesty, because it seems a kind of ostentation not to be content to teach the
        art, but to appear desirous themselves of creating examples artificially. That, they say,
        would be showing <note type="margin" n="2">2</note> themselves off, not showing what the art is. Hence
        it is in the first place a sense of shame which keeps us from following this practice, for
        we should appear to be approving of ourselves alone,<note type="footnote" n="a"
            place="opposite">a Cf. Horace, Ars Poet. 444.</note> to be prizing ourselves, scorning
        and scoffing at others. For when we can take an example from Ennius. or offer one from
            Gracchus,<note type="footnote" n="b" place="opposite">b Ennius and Gracchus served as
            models for Crassus in his youth; cf. Cicero, De Oratore 1. 34. 154.</note> it seems
        presumptuous to neglect these and to have recourse to our own examples. In the second place,
        examples, they say, serve the purpose of testimony; for, like the testimony of a witness,
        the example enforces what the precept has suggested and only to a slight degree
            effected.<note type="footnote" n="c" place="opposite">c See note on 4. iii. 5

        proof of something else should itself require proof. In fact, inventors of examples must
        either prefer themselves to all others and esteem their own products most of all, or else
        deny that the best examples are those taken from the orators or poets of highest reputation.
        If they should set themselves above all others, they are unbearably conceited; if they

        greater authority to their doctrine but also sharpen in men the desire to imitate them? Yes,

        accomplished by industry alone, we should yet deserve praise for not having avoided such a
        task; but actually, without the highest art it cannot be done. For who, unless he has a
        consummate grasp of the art of rhetoric, could in so vast and diffuse a literature mark and
        distinguish the demands of the art? Laymen, reading good orations and poems, approve the
        orators and poets, but without comprehending what has called forth their approval, because

        very men who invented this art and are now by reason of their antiquity quite universally
        esteemed. If, however, leaving the prestige of the ancients out of consideration, they are
        willing to compare all the arguments, point for point, they will understand that we need not
        yield to antiquity in everything. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>III. First, then, let us beware lest the Greeks offer us
        too childish an argument in their talk about modesty. For if modesty consists in saying
        nothing or writing nothing, why do they write or speak at all? But if they do write
        something of their own, then why does modesty keep them from composing, themselves,
        everything they write? It is as if some one should come to the Olympic games to run, and
        having taken a position for the start, should accuse of impudence those who have begun the
        race— should himself stand within the barrier and recount to others how Ladas<note

        the testimony must accord with the proposition, for otherwise it cannot confirm the

        so? In that they promise to write a treatise of the art, and then mostly bring forward
        examples from authors who were ignorant of the art. Now who can give authority to his
        writings on the art unless he writes something in conformity with the art?<note

        Doubtless no one quite uncultivated can select in this way; yet many who lack the highest
            <note type="margin" n="7">7</note> art can. For any one at all who has heard more than a little
        about the art, especially in the field of style, will be able to discern all the passages
        composed in accordance with the rules; but the ability to compose them only the trained man
        will possess. It is as if you should wish to choose maxims from the tragedies of
            Ennius,<note type="footnote" n="b" place="opposite">b Cf. Isocrates, Ad Nicocl. 44, on
            the selection of maxims from the outstanding poets.</note> or messengers' reports from
        the tragedies of Pacuvius; if, however, just because no one who is quite illiterate can do
        this, you should suppose that having done it, you are most highly cultivated, you would be
        foolish, because any person moderately well-read could do it easily. In the same fashion if,
        having chosen from orations or poems examples marked by definite tokens of art, you should
        suppose that your performance gives proof of superlative art on the ground that no ignoramus
        is capable of it, you would be in error, because by this token that you offer we see only
        that you have some knowledge, but we shall need still other tokens to convince us that you
        know a great deal. Now if to discern what is written artistically proves your mastery of the
        art, then a far better proof of this mastery is to write artistically yourself. For though
        the artistic writer will find it easy to discern what has been skilfully written by others,
        the facile chooser of examples will not necessarily write with skill himself. And even if it
        is an especial mark of artistic skill, let them </p>

    <p> student whether he should believe that every one can attain the sum total of qualities, or
        that no one can, or that one individual can attain one quality and another individual
        another quality. For if the student believes that all qualities can exist in one man, he
        himself will strive for a mastery of them all. But if he despairs of this achievement, he
        will occupy himself in acquiring a few qualities, and with these be content. Nor is this
        surprising, since the teacher of the art himself has been unable to find all the qualities
        in one author. Thus, when examples have been drawn from Cato, the Gracchi, Laelius, Scipio,

        say, no one would fall into this opinion if the rhetoricians had drawn examples from one
        author alone. Actually, the fact that the writers on rhetoric have presented neither their
        own examples nor those of some single author, or even two, but have borrowed from all the

        benefit for speaking, he might well in support employ the argument that no one man has been
        able to master all the branches of rhetoric. Is it not ridiculous for a rhetorician himself

        all, an example which is cited by a writer on an art should be proof of his own skill in
        that art. It is as if a merchant selling purple or some other commodity should say: " Buy of
        me, but I shall borrow from some one else a sample of this to show you." So do these very
        people who offer merchandise for sale go in search of a sample of it elsewhere; they say:

    <p> theory of examples. Now it is time to turn to the principles of Style. I shall divide the
        teaching of Style into two parts. First I shall state the kinds to which oratorical style
        should always confine itself,<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a The three kinds
            do not occur in every correct discourse, but the kinds of correct discourse are limited

            type="margin" n="11">11</note> <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>VIII. There are, then, three kinds of style, called types,<note
            type="footnote" n="b" place="opposite">b χαρακτῆρες, πλάσματα. Notice the word figura.
            Our author's term corresponding to English " figure of speech " is exornatio (σχῆμα), as
            in 4. xiii. 18 below (Cicero's term, lumen, is used only in 4. xxiii. 32 below); figura
            as " figure of speech " appears first in Quintilian.</note> to which discourse, if
        faultless, confines itself: the first we call the Grand; the second, the Middle; the third,
        the Simple.<note type="footnote" n="c" place="opposite">c ἁδρόν (μεγαλοπρεπές, περιττόν),
            μέσον (μικτόν), ἰσχνόν (λιτόν), and for other terms see W. Schmid, Rhein. Mus. 49
            (1894). 136 ff. Here is the first extant division of the styles into three. Cf.
            especially Cicero, De Oratore 3. 45. 177, 52. 199, 55. 212, Orator 5. 20 ff., 23. 75
            ff.; Dionys. Halic., De Demosth. 1 ff., and for the doctrine as transferred to
            Composition (σύνθεσις), De Composit. Verb., chaps. 21 ff.; Quintilian, 12. 10. 58 ff.;
            also Varro in Gellius 6. 14. To Cicero (Orator 21. 69 ff.), following a Hellenistic (and
            doubtless Peripatetic) concept, each of the styles represents a function of the orator,
            the plain (subtile) serving for proof (probare), the middle (modicum) for delight
            (delectare), and the vigorous (vehemens)<pb n="253"/> for swaying the hearers
            (flectere). Scholars are not in agreement on the ultimate origin of the fixed
            categories; some assign the doctrine to Theophrastus (see A. Körte, Hermes 64 [1929].
            80, and Wilhelm Kroll, Rhein. Mus. 62 [1907]. 86 ff., Introd. to ed. of Cicero, Orator
            [Berlin, 1913], p. 4, note 1, and " Rhetorik," coll. 1074 f.), while others deny this
            attribution (see G. L. Hendrickson, Amer. Journ. Philol. 25 [1904]. 125-46 and 26
            [1905]. 249-290, and Stroux, De Theophrasti virt. dic., Leipzig, 1912, chaps. 1, 7, and
            8). On varying views of the part played by the Peripatetic ethical idea of the mean
            (μεσάτης) in the development of the doctrine see especially the articles by Hendrickson
            and Kroll, and S. F. Bonner in Class. Philol. 33 (1938). 257-266. Cf. the four types of
            style in Demetrius, De Elocut. 36, the twofold division in Cicero, Brutus 55. 201; and

            Theorie der Antike," Phyllobolia für Peter von der Mühll, Basel, 1946, p. 29.
            Quintilian, 12. 10. 66 ff., considers the limitation to three styles arbitrary.</note>
        The Grand type consists of a smooth and ornate arrangement of impressive words.<note

            Antithesis (xv. 21), Interrogation (xv. 22), Paronomasia (xxiii. 32), Surrender (xxix.
            39—provoking pity), and Asyndeton (xxx. 41—animation).</note> The Middle type consists
        of words of a lower, yet not of the lowest and most colloquial, class of words. The Simple
        type is brought down even to the most current idiom of standard speech. </p>







    <pb n="255"/>

    <p> A discourse will be composed in the Grand style if to each idea are applied the most ornate
        words that can be found for it, whether literal or figurative; if impressive thoughts are
        chosen, such as are used in Amplification and Appeal to Pity; and if we employ figures of
        thought and figures of diction which have grandeur—these I shall discuss later.<note

            above,<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a 4. viii. 11.</note> we have
        somewhat relaxed our style, and yet have not descended to the most ordinary prose, as
        follows: “Men of the jury, you see against whom we are waging war—against allies who have
        been wont to light in our defence, and together with us to preserve our empire by their
        valour and zeal. Not only must they have known themselves, their resources, and their
        manpower, but their nearness to us and their alliance with us in all affairs enabled them no
        less to learn and appraise the power of the Roman people in every sphere. When they had
        resolved to fight against us, on what, I ask you, did they rely in presuming to undertake
        the war, since they understood that much the greater part of our allies remained faithful to
        duty, and since they saw that they had at hand no great supply of soldiers, no competent
        commanders, and no public money—in short, none of the things needful for carrying on the
        war? Even if they were waging war with neighbours on a question of boundaries, even if in
        their opinion one battle would decide the contest, they would yet come to the task in every
        way better prepared and equipped than they are now. It is still less credible that with such
        meagre forces they would attempt to usurp that sovereignty over the whole world which all
        the civilized peoples, kings, and barbarous nations have accepted, in part compelled by
        force, in part of their own will, when conquered either by the arms of Rome or by her
        generosity. Some one will ask: ' What of the Fregellans? Did they not make the attempt on
        their own initiative? ' Yes, but these allies would be less ready to make the attempt </p>




    <pb n="261"/>

    <p> precisely because they saw how the Fregellans fared.<note type="footnote" n="a"
            place="opposite">a By destroying Fregellae when, after a long history of loyalty, she

        inexperienced peoples, unable to find in history a precedent for every circumstance, are
        through imprudence easily led into error; whilst those who know what has befallen others can
        easily from the fortunes of these others draw profit for their own policies.<note

            to descry what to avoid," and 133; Livy, 22. 39. 10; Tacitus, Annals 4. 33.</note> Have
        they, then, in taking up arms, been impelled by no motive? Have they relied on no hope? Who
        will believe that any one has been so mad as to dare, with no forces to depend on, to
        challenge the sovereignty of the Roman people? They must, therefore, have had some motive,
        and what else can this be but what I say? "<note type="footnote" n="c" place="opposite">c
            Whether the example is an excerpt from a speech actually delivered, or our author's own

            malicious fraud compelled the allies to war against Rome; confederates at Rome are

            belongs to the rationis confirmatio of an argument (see 2. xviii. 28 above), and is not
            so impassioned as the example of the grand style above. Dionysius Halic, De Demosth.,
            ch. 3 ff., chooses Thrasymachus, Isocrates, and Plato as representatives of the middle

        ordinary speech of every day, the following will serve as an example: " Now our friend
        happened to enter the baths, and, after washing, was beginning to be rubbed down. Then, just
        as he decided to go down into the pool, suddenly this fellow turned up. ' Say, young chap,'
        said he,' your slave boys have just beat me; you must make it good.' The young man grew red,
        for at his age he was not used to being hailed by a stranger. This creature started to shout
        the same words, and more, in a louder voice. With difficulty the youth replied: ' Well, but
        let me look into the matter.' </p>







    <pb n="263"/>

    <p> Right then the fellow cries out in that tone of his that might well force blushes from any
        one; this is how aggressive and harsh it is—a tone certainly not practised in the
        neighbourhood of the Sundial, I would say, but backstage, and in places of that kind.<note
            type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a The Sundial, in the Forum, was a much
            frequented meeting-place for gossip; cf. Cicero, Pro Quinctio 18. 59. The Roman citizen
            ordinarily looked down upon actors as beneath his dignity; they were usually freedmen or
            slaves. For the connection between the stage and vice see, e.g., Cicero, In Cat. 2. 5.
            9.</note> The young man was embarrassed. And no wonder, for his ears still rang with the
        scoldings of his tutor, and he was not used to abusive language of this kind. For where
        would he have seen a buffoon, with not a blush left, who thought of himself as having no
        good name to lose, so that he could do anything he liked without damage to his reputation?

            (pedagogi, the diminutive oriculas), idioms like de traverso, coepit with the passive,
            the vulgar use of the archaism pone for post, and of the indicative potest in a

        <note type="margin" n="15">15</note> Thus the examples themselves are enough to make clear the types of
        style. For one arrangement of words is of the simple type, another again belongs to the
        grand, and another belongs to the middle. But in striving to attain these styles, we must
        avoid falling into faulty styles closely akin to them.<note type="footnote" n="c">c

            relation to the mean. The faulty styles were known to Marcus Varro (Gellius 6. 14); cf.
            also Demetrius, De Elocut. 114, 186, 236, 302.</note> For instance, bordering on the

        and Distinction.<note type="footnote" n="e" place="opposite">e The qualities were chiefly
            treated by the Peripatetics and Stoics. The Theophrastan scheme is here modified. The

            Appropriateness (τὸ πρέπον), and Ornamentation (κατασκευή), this last embracing Correct
            Choice of Words (ἐκλογὴ ὀνομάτων), Artistic Composition (ἁρμονία), and the Figures
            (σχήματα). Thus for our author, elegantia<pb n="269"/> comprises two primary qualities
            of Theophrastus' scheme; Appropriateness (see note on 4. x. 15 above) is here missing;
            the ornamentation residing in the choice of words is left unconsidered (except for what
            he says under explanatio, and his treatment of Metaphor among the figures; see 4. xxxiv.
            45 below); Artistic Composition is a primary quality, and is not treated as a branch of
            Ornamentation; finally, Ornamentation, represented by dignitas, is limited to the
            Figures. See Stroux, De Theophrasti virt. die, pp. 22-3, 64—7.</note> Taste makes each

            divides figures of diction into the grammatical (λέξεως) and the rhetorical (λόγου),
            probably following<pb n="275"/> a Stoic author. The ancients regarded Gorgias of
            Leontini (fifth century B.C.) as the inventor of σχήματα. Our author's treatment is the
            oldest extant formal one, yet represents a period preceding that of complete
            systematization (that of Quintilian and Phoebammon). Tropes are considered at 4. xxxi.
            42 below; the figures of thought begin at 4. xxxv. 47. The ancient rhetoricians differ
            sometimes greatly, sometimes slightly, in their definitions of figures, which became
            excessively numerous as refinements were made in distinguishing them. The line of
            demarcation between tropes and figures, and that between figures of thought and figures
            of diction were often vague. See Quintilian, Bks. 8 and 9, especially 9. 1. 1 ff.;

    <p> statement we make, and seek the meaning of each successive affirmation, as follows: "When
        our ancestors condemned a woman for one crime, they considered that by this single judgement
        she was convicted of many transgressions. I low so? Judged unchaste, she was also deemed
        guilty of poisoning.<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a The same argument is used
            in Seneca, Contr. 7. 3 (18). 6.</note> Why? Because, having sold her body to the basest

        and the others involved, as she sees, in the infamy of her dishonour. And what then? Those
        whom she fears so much she would inevitably wish to destroy. Why inevitably? Because no
        honourable motive can restrain a woman who is terrified by the enormity of her crime,
        emboldened by her lawlessness, and made heedless by the nature of her sex. Well now, what
        did they think of a woman found guilty of poisoning? That she was necessarily also unchaste.
        Why? Because no motive could more easily have led her to this crime than base love and
        unbridled lust. Furthermore, if a woman's soul had been corrupted, they did not consider her
        body chaste. Now then, did they observe this same principle with respect to men? Not at all.
        And why? Because men are driven to each separate crime by a different passion, whereas a
        woman is led into all crimes by one sole passion."<note type="footnote" n="b"

        Because it is my habit to scorn, not <note type="margin" n="24">24</note> emulate, such folly." This

            despised." Longinus, De Sublim. 41, disapproves of the agitated movement dichorees give

        hope in chance, what great harm can chance do him? " In a Conclusion, as follows: " But if
        Fortune has her greatest power over those who have committed all their plans to chance, we
        should not entrust our all with her, lest she gain too great a domination over us."<note
            type="footnote" n="c" place="opposite">c For the theme cf. 4. xvii. 24 above. Our
            author, unlike other post-Aristotelian rhetoricians, does not say that the Period is
            comprised of membra, yet this example seems to contain four—the upper limit usually
            allowed; see, e.g.,<pb n="297"/> Cicero, Orator 66. 222, and Demetrius, De Elocut. 1.
            16, but also Quintilian, 9. 4. 125. On the theory of the Period see esp. Aristotle,

            (1930). 192-208, 255-284, 414-436. Aristotle recognized only periods of either one or
            two cola, and in fact the division into cola was not of primary importance in his
            theory.</note> In these three types a compact style is so necessary for the force of the
        period that the orator's power seems inadequate if he fails to present the Maxim, Contrast,
        or Conclusion in a press of words. But in other eases as well it is often proper, although
        not imperative, to express certain thoughts by means of periods of this sort. </p>

        the like. <milestone unit="section" n="22"/>XXII. There are others also in which the words lack so close a resemblance, and
        yet are not dissimilar. Here is an example of one kind of such word-plays: " Quid veniam,
        qui sim, quem insimulem, cui prosim, quae postulem, brevi cognoscetis."<note type="footnote"
            n="c">c " Why I come, who I am, whom I accuse, whom I am helping, what I ask for von
            will soon know." Cf. Plautus, Poen. 992: adei atque appella quid velit, quid venerit,
            qui sit, quoiatis, unde sit. “ Go up to him and ask him what he wants, why he has come,
            who he is, of what country, and whence he comes.”</note> For in this example there is a
        sort of resemblance among certain words, not so complete, to be sure, as in the instances
        above, yet sometimes serviceable. An example of another kind: "Demus operam, Quirites, ne
        omnino patres conscripti circumscripti putentur."<note type="footnote" n="d">d " Let us see
            to it, fellow-citizens, that the Conscript Fathers be not thought to have been utterly
            duped." Quintilian, 9. 3. 72, considers this kind of paronomasia as producing the very
            worst of trivial effects. Seneca, Suas. 7. 11, reproves for bad taste a speaker who
            punned on scripsit and proscripsit. It has been conjectured (see Kroehnert, p. 31) that
            Crassus may have uttered these words when speaking on behalf of the Servilian law; see
            note on 4. iii. 5.</note> In this paronomasia the resemblance is closer than in the
        preceding, yet is not so close as in those above, because some letters are added and some at
        the same time removed. </p>

        <note type="margin" n="32">32</note> These last three figures—the first based on like case inflections,
        the second on like word endings, and the third on paronomasia—are to be used very sparingly
        when we speak in an actual cause, because their invention seems impossible without labour
        and pains. <milestone unit="section" n="23"/>XXIII. Such endeavours, indeed, seem more suitable for a speech of entertainment
        than for use in an actual cause.<note type="footnote" n="b">b These figures serve epideictic
            better than judicial or deliberative oratory. Cicero warns the speaker of the Attic
            plain style against the use of these three figures (and of Isocolon, Orator 25. 84), but
            allows them in epideictic discourse (Orator 12. 38, Part. Orat. 21. 72); Quintilian, 8.
            3. 12, also justifies the full use of ornamentation in epideictic.</note> Hence the
        speaker's credibility, impressiveness, and seriousness are lessened by crowding these
        figures together. Furthermore, apart from destroying the speaker's authority, such a style
        gives offence because these figures have grace and elegance, but not impressiveness and
        beauty. Thus the grand and beautiful can give pleasure for a long time, but the neat and
        graceful quickly sate the hearing, the most fastidious of the senses.<note type="footnote"

        prejudicial to the opposition, as follows: " I ask, therefore, from what source has the
        defendant become so wealthy? Has an ample patrimony been left to him? But his father's goods
        were sold. Has some bequest come to him? That cannot be urged; on the contrary he has even
        been disinherited by all his kin. Has he received some award from a civil action, whether in

        monies from an illicit source." <milestone unit="section" n="24"/>XXIV. Another example: " Time and time again, men of the
        jury, have I observed that numerous defendants look for support in some honourable deed
        which not even their enemies can impeach. My adversary can do no such thing. Will he take
        refuge in his father's virtue? On the contrary, you have taken your oath and condemned him
        to death. Or will he turn to his own life? What life, and wherein lived honourably? Why, the

        he was yet unconvicted. Did you respect the laws which forbid this act? On the contrary, you
        decided that they did not even exist in the books. When he reminded you of your old
        friendship, were you moved? No, you killed him nevertheless, and with even greater
        eagerness. And then when his children grovelled at your feet, were you moved to pity? No, in

            Rutilius," excludes finitio from the figures of diction. The figure goes back to

        economy is careful conservation of one's own goods, and greed is wrongful covetousness of
        the goods of others." Again: That act of yours is not bravery, but recklessness, because to
        be brave is to disdain toil and peril, for a useful purpose and after weighing the

        Definition is accounted useful for this reason: it sets forth the full meaning and character
        of a thing so lucidly and briefly that to express it in more words seems superfluous, and to
        express it in fewer is considered impossible. <milestone unit="section" n="26"/>XXVI. Transition<note type="footnote" n="e">e

            classes it as a figure of thought; transitus in 9. 2. 61 is rejected as a figure.</note>

        " My benefactions to this defendant you know; now learn how he has requited me." This figure
        is not without value for two ends: it reminds the hearer of what the speaker has said, and
        also prepares him for what is to come. <note type="margin" n="36">36</note> Correction<note
            type="footnote" n="b">b ἐπιδιόρθωσις, ἐπανόρθωσις, related to μετάνοια.</note> retracts
        what has been said and replaces it with what seems more suitable, as follows: " But if the
        defendant had asked his hosts, or rather had only hinted, this could easily have been
        accomplished." Again: " After the men in question had conquered, or rather had been
        conquered—for how shall I call that a conquest which has brought more disaster than benefit
        to the conquerors? " Again: " O Virtue's companion, Envy, who art wont to pursue good men,

            you preparing to appease envy by forsaking virtue? " Insector is the frequentative form
            of insequor.</note> This figure makes an impression upon the hearer, for the idea when
        expressed by an ordinary word seems rather feebly stated, but after the speaker's own
        amendment it is made more striking by means of the more appropriate expression. " Then would
        it not be preferable," some one will say, " especially in writing, to resort to the best and
        choicest word at the beginning? " Sometimes this is not preferable, when, as the change of
        word will serve to show, the thought is such that in rendering it by an ordinary </p>

    <p> word you seem to have expressed it rather feebly, but having come to a choicer word you make
        the thought more striking. But if you had at once arrived at this word, the grace neither of

            praeteritio, and sometimes παρασιώπησις, which Quintilian, 9. 3. 99, excludes from the

            praecisio, 4. xxx. 41 below, and Cicero's reticentia (De Oratore 3. 53. 205, and Orator
            40. 138).</note> occurs when we say that we are passing by, or do not know, or refuse to
        say that which precisely now we are saying, as follows: " Your boyhood, indeed, which you
        dedicated to intemperance of all kinds, I would discuss, if I thought this the right time.
        But at present I advisedly leave that aside. This too I pass by, that the tribunes have
        reported you as irregular in military service. Also that you have given satisfaction to
        Lucius Labeo for injuries done him I regard as irrelevant to the present matter. Of these
        things I say nothing, but return to the issue in this trial."<note type="footnote" n="b">b
            Speaker, opponent, and Labeo all are unknown. The date may perhaps be assigned to the
            time of the Marsic war, about 90 B.C.; see Friedrich Muenzer, P.-W. 12. 245.</note>
        Again: " I do not mention that you have taken monies from our allies; I do not concern
        myself with your having despoiled the cities, kingdoms, and homes of them all. I pass by
        your thieveries and robberies, all of them." This figure is useful if employed in a matter
        which it is not pertinent to call specifically to the attention of others, because there is
        advantage in making only an indirect reference to it, or because the direct reference would
        be tedious or undignified, or cannot be made clear, or can easily be refuted. As a result,
        it is of greater advantage to create a suspicion by Paralipsis than to insist directly on a

        or age physical beauty fades." Disjunction is suited to elegant display, and so we shall use
        it moderately, that it may not cloy; Conjunction is suited to brevity, and hence is to be
        used more frequently. These three figures spring from a single type. </p>

        intentionally not scattered at random, but have separated from those above, because they all
        belong in one class. They indeed all have this in common, that the language departs from the
        ordinary meaning of the words <note type="footnote" n="b" place="opposite">b These ten
            figures of diction are tropi (τρόποι, tropes), a term our author does not use; cf.
            Quintilian, 8. 6. 1: "A trope is an artistic change of a word or phrase from its proper
            signification to another." Tropes were at first, as here, not separated from figures of
            thought and diction (σχήματα). Cicero, Brutus 18. 69, tells us that the division was of
            Greek origin. Even in the time of Quintilian (see 9. 1. 1-9) the line of demarcation was
            not always clear.</note> and is, with a certain grace, applied in another sense. Of
        these figures the first is Onomatopoeia,<note type="footnote" n="c" place="opposite">c
            ὀνοματοποιία. Cf. Julius Caesar in Gellius, 1. 10. 4: " Avoid, as you would a rock, an
            unheard-of and unfamiliar<pb n="333"/> word." Cicero admits unusual (old-fashioned),
            new, and metaphorical words, although recognizing that these are allowed more freely in
            poetry than in oratory; see De Oratore 3. 38. 152 ff., Orator 20. 68 and 24. 81, and
            also the advice which Horace, Ars Poet. 46 ff. and Epist. 2. 2. 119-121, gives to poets
            to use neologisms, but with restraint. Quintilian likewise tolerates neologisms despite
            the danger in their use, but does not allow Roman speakers the imitative type of
            Onomatopoeia, although this was " held as one of the highest virtues by the Greeks; "
            see 1. 5. 71 f., 8. 6. 31 f., 8. 3. 35-37. Cf. also Gellius, 11. 7. 1: " But as for me I
            think it more objectionable and censurable to use words that are new, unknown, and
            unheard-of than to use those that are hackneyed and mean."</note> which suggests to us
        that we should ourselves designate with a suitable word, whether for the sake of imitation
        or of expressiveness, a thing which either lacks a name<note type="footnote" n="d">d See
            note on Metaphor, 4. xxxiv. 45 below.</note> or has an inappropriate name. For the sake
        of imitation, as follows: our ancestors, for example, said " roar," " bellow," " murmur," "
        hiss; " for the sake of expressiveness, as follows: </p>

    <p> " After this creature attacked the republic, there was a hullabaloo among the first men of
        the state." This figure is to be used rarely, lest the frequent recurrence of the neologism
        breed aversion; but if it is used appropriately and sparingly, then the novelty, far from
        offending, even gives distinction to the style. Antonomasia<note type="footnote" n="a"
            place="opposite">a ἀντονομασία.</note> or Pronomination designates by a kind of
        adventitious epithet a thing that cannot be called by its proper name; for example, if some
        one speaking of the Graechi should say: " Surely the grandsons of Africanus did not behave
        like this! "; or again, if some one speaking of his adversary should say: " See now, men of
        the jury, how your Sir Swashbuckler<note type="footnote" n="b" place="opposite">b Lit., "
            flat of the blade."</note> there has treated me." In this way we shall be able, not
        without elegance, in praise and in censure, concerning physical attributes, qualities of
        character, or external circumstances,<note type="footnote" n="c" place="opposite">c Cf. 3.

            μετωνυμία.</note> is the figure which draws from an object closely akin or associated an
        expression suggesting the object meant, but not called by its own name. This is accomplished
        by substituting the name of the greater thing for that of the lesser, as if one speaking of
        the Tarpeian Rock should term it " the Capitoline or by substituting the name of the thing
        invented for that of the inventor, as if one should say " wine " for " Liber," " wheat " for
        " Ceres.";<note type="footnote" n="f">f Liber and Ceres are common metonyms; see Cicero, De

        say: " Mars forced you to do that "; or effect for cause, as when we call an art idle
        because it produces idleness in people, or speak of numb cold because cold produces
            numbness.<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a This last illustration is used

        cannot be vanquished in warfare nor Greece in studies "; for here instead of Greeks and
        Italians the lands that comprise them are designated. Container will be designated by means
        of content:<note type="footnote" n="b" place="opposite">b Quintilian, 8.6.24-5, approves the

        abundant not only amongst the poets and orators but also in everyday speech.

        is suggested by one sign, the flutes. A part from the whole, as if one should say to a

        from the singular, as follows: "To the Carthaginian came aid from the Spaniard, and from
        that fierce Transalpine. In Italy, too, many a wearer of the toga shared the same
        sentiment." In the following the singular will be understood from the plural: " Dread
        disaster smote his breasts with grief; so, panting, from out his lungs' very depth he sobbed
        for anguish." In the first example more than one Spaniard, Gaul, and Roman citizen are
        understood, and in this last only one breast and one lung.<note type="footnote" n="d">d In

        as follows: " For when dogs act the part of wolves, to what guardian, pray, are we going to
        entrust our herds of cattle? " An Allegory is presented in the form of argument when a

        quiet the feelings aroused by the frankness. As a result, the praise frees the hearer from

    <p> friendship, if taken at the right place, is especially effective in keeping the hearers from
        error and in presenting us, the speakers, as friendly both to the hearers and to the truth.
        There is also a certain kind of frankness in speaking which is achieved by a craftier
        device, when we remonstrate with the hearers as they wish us to remonstrate with them, or
        when we say " we fear how the audience may take " something which we know they all will hear
        with acceptance, " yet the truth moves us to say it none the less."<note type="footnote"

            Condamin, Repertoire Alphabétique des Citations, Lyons and Paris, 1926, pp. 26
            ff.)</note> I shall add examples of both these kinds. Of the former, as follows: "

        in every one. You think that every one strives to perform what he has promised you. You are
        mistaken, and now for a long time you have been kept back by false and groundless hope, in
        your fatuity choosing to seek from others what lay in your power, rather than take it

            122 B.C.) by Gaius Gracchus, the words here being directed against M. Livius Drusus; but
            there is no real evidence to substantiate the conjecture. Rutilius Lupus, 2. 18 (Halm,
            pp. 20-21), uses as an example of this figure the following passage from Demosthenes
                (Fragm.<pb n="353"/> Orat. Att., ed. Baiter-Sauppe, fragm. 54, p. 257): " But shall

            because the common welfare demands speech. It is by your own doing, men of Athens, that
            the state is in such great peril. For you have failed to defend yourselves, by
            recklessly believing every one and by esteeming as most useful the opinions of those
            whose counsels are most cowardly."</note> Of the latter kind of Frank Speech the
        following will be an example: " I enjoyed a friendship with this person, men of the jury,
        yet of that friendship—although I fear how you are going to receive what I shall say, I Mill
        yet say it —you have deprived me. Why: Because, in order to win your approval, I have
        preferred to consider your assailant as an enemy rather than as a friend." </p>

        both to avoid envy and to secure praise. Again: " Was it then because of avarice or of need
        that he entered upon the crime? Avarice? But he was most generous to his friends, and that
        is a sign of generosity, a virtue opposed to avarice. Need? But his father left him a

        see what miseries usually follow upon the capture of a city. Those who have borne arms
        against the victors are forthwith slain with extreme cruelty. Of the rest, those who by
        reason of youth and strength can endure hard labour are carried off into slavery, and those
        who cannot are deprived of life. In short, at one and the same time a house blazes up by the
        enemy's torch, and they whom nature or free choice has joined in the bonds of kinship or of
        sympathy are dragged apart. Of the children, some are torn from their parents' arms, others
        murdered on their parents' bosom, still others violated at their parents' feet. No one, men
        of the jury, can, by words, do justice to the deed, nor reproduce in language the magnitude
        of the disaster."<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a The example is Greek in

        your brother we know, that you are poor and destitute we now see. How, therefore, can you
        show that you had no motive for the crime? " There is the following difference between the

        the crime. To be sure, some one or two of these things can by chance have happened in such a
        way as to throw suspicion upon this defendant; but for everything to coincide from first to
        last, he must have been a participant in the crime. This cannot be the result of chance."
        This figure has force, and in a conjectural issue is almost always essential; in the other
        types of causes and indeed in all discourse it is to be used occasionally. <note type="margin" n="54"

            progymnasma.</note> consists in dwelling on the same topic and yet seeming to say
        something ever new. It is accomplished in two ways: by merely repeating the same idea, or by
        descanting upon it. We shall not repeat the same thing precisely—for that, to be sure, would
        weary the hearer and not refine the idea— but with changes. Our changes will be of three
        kinds: in the words, in the delivery, and in the treatment. Our changes will be verbal when,
        having expressed the idea once, we repeat it once again or oftener in </p>

    <p> other, equivalent terms, as follows: " No peril is so great that a wise man would think it
        ought to be avoided when the safety of the fatherland is at stake. When the lasting security
        of the state is in question, the man endowed with good principles will undoubtedly believe
        that in defence of the fortunes of the republic he ought to shun no crisis of life, and he
        will ever persist in the determination eagerly to enter, for the fatherland, any combat,
        however great the peril to life." Our changes will reside in the delivery if now in the tone
        of conversation, now in an energetic tone, and now in variation after variation of voice and
        gesture, repeating the same ideas in different words, we also change the delivery quite
        strikingly. This cannot be described with complete effectiveness, and yet it is clear
        enough. Hence there is no need of illustration. <note type="margin" n="55">55</note> The third kind of
        change, accomplished in the treatment, will take place if we transfer the thought into the
        form of Dialogue or into the form of Arousal. <milestone unit="section" n="43"/>XLIII. Dialogue—which I shall soon more fully
        discuss in its place<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a 4. lii. 65 below.</note>
        and shall now touch upon briefly, as far as may be sufficient for the present purpose—
        consists in putting in the mouth of some person language in keeping with his character, as
        follows (for the sake of greater clarity, to continue the same theme as above): " The wise
        man will think that for the common weal he ought to undergo every peril.<note

    <p> Above all, let me spend my life, which I owe to fate, for the salvation of my country. She
        has nourished me. She has in safety and honour reared me even to this time of life. She has
        protected my interests by good laws, the best of customs, and a most honourable training.
        How can I adequately repay her from whom I have received these blessings? ' According as the
        wise man often says this to himself, when the republic is in danger, he on his part will
        shun no danger." Again, the idea is changed in the treatment by means of a transfer to the
        form of Arousal,<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a ἀνάστασις.</note> when not
        only we ourselves seem to speak under emotion, but we also stir the hearer, thus: " Who is
        possessed of reasoning power so feeble, whose soul is bound in such straits of envy, that he
        would not heap eager praise upon this man and judge him most wise, a man who for the
        salvation of the fatherland, the security of the state, and the prosperity of the republic
        eagerly undertakes and gladly undergoes <note type="margin" n="56">56</note> any danger, no matter how
        great or terrible? For my part, my desire to praise this man adequately is greater than my
        power to do so, and I am sure that this feeling of inadequacy is shared by all of you." The
        theme, then, will be varied in speaking in these three ways: in the words, in the delivery,
        in the treatment. In the treatment we shall vary the theme by two means: by Dialogue and by
        Arousal. But when we descant upon the same theme, we shall use a great many variations.
        Indeed, after having expressed the theme simply, we can subjoin the Reason, and then express
        the theme in another form, with or without the Reasons;<note type="footnote" n="b"

        diction and of thought, can therefore be exceedingly ornate. The following, then, will
        illustrate a treatment in seven parts—to continue the use of the same theme for my example,

        developed in a multiple manner:<note type="footnote" n="d" place="opposite">d The tractatio

        speech that carries over an element of likeness from one thing to a different thing. 'This
        is used to embellish or prove or clarify or vivify. Furthermore, corresponding to these four
        aims, it has four forms of presentation: Contrast, Negation. Detailed Parallel, Abridged
        Comparison. To each single aim in the use of Comparison we shall adapt the corresponding
        form of presentation. <milestone unit="section" n="46"/>XLVI. In the form of a contrast, in order to embellish, Comparison is
        used as follows: " Unlike what happens in the palaestra, where he who receives the flaming
        torch is swifter in the relay race than he who hands it on, the new general who receives
        command of an army is not superior to the general who retires from its command. For in the
        one case it is an exhausted runner who hands the torch to a fresh athlete, whereas in this
        it is an experienced commander who hands over the army to an inexperienced." This could have
        been expressed quite </p>







    <pb n="379"/>

    <p> simply, clearly, and plausibly without the Comparison, as follows: "They say that usually it
        is inferior generals who take over the command of armies from superior." But the Comparison
        is used for embellishment, so as to secure a certain distinction for the style. It is
        moreover presented in the form of a contrast. For a Comparison in the form of a contrast is
        used when we deny that something else is like the thing we are asserting to be true. In the
        form of a negation and for the purpose of proof, Comparison will be used as follows: "
        Neither can an untrained horse, however well-built by nature, be fit for the services
        desired of a horse, nor can an uncultivated man, however well-endowed by nature, attain to
            virtue."<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a Cf. Xenophon, Memorabilia 4. 1.
            3: " Such as believed themselves good by nature and looked down upon learning, Socrates
            would teach that the greater the natural endowments, the greater is the need of
            education, pointing out that spirited and impetuous thoroughbreds, if they are tamed<pb
                n="379"/> when young, become useful and excellent horses, but if not broken in,
            become intractable and worthless; " also Quintilian, 5. 11. 24 f.</note> This idea has
        been rendered more plausible, for it becomes easier to believe that virtue cannot be secured
        without culture, when we see that not even a horse can be serviceable if untrained. Thus the
        Comparison is used for the purpose of proof, and moreover is presented in the form of a
        negation, as is clear from the first word of the Comparison. <note type="margin" n="60">60</note> <milestone unit="section" n="47"/>XLVII.
        A Comparison will be used also for greater clarity—the presentation being in abridged
        form—as follows: "In maintaining a friendship, as in a footrace, you must train yourself not
        only so that you succeed in running as far as is required, but so that, extending yourself
        by will and sinew, you easily run beyond that point." Indeed this Comparison serves to make
        more obvious the poor reasoning evinced by the detractors of those who, for example, are </p>







    <pb n="381"/>

    <p> protectors of a friend's children after his death; for a runner ought to have enough speed
        to carry him beyond the goal, and a friend so much goodwill that in the devotion of
        friendship he may reach even beyond what his friend is capable of perceiving. The Comparison
        is moreover presented in abridged form, for one term is not detached from the other as in
        the other forms, but the two are conjoined and intermingled in the presentation. A
        Comparison will be used for vividness, and be set forth in the form of a detailed
            parallel,<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a See note on Exemplification, 4.

            Pythian games; see Lucian, Adv. Indoctum 8-10. Cf. also Socrates in Xenophon,

        clothed in a gold-embroidered robe, with purple mantle interlaced in various colours,
        wearing a golden crown illumined with large gleaming jewels, and holding a lyre covered with
        golden ornaments and set off with ivory. Further, he has a personal beauty, presence, and
        stature that impose dignity. If, when by these means he has roused a great expectation in
        the public, he should in the silence he has created suddenly give utterance to a rasping
        voice, and this should be accompanied by a repulsive gesture, he is the more forcibly thrust
        off in derision and scorn, the richer his adornment and the higher the hopes he has raised.
        In the same way, a man of high station, endowed with great and opulent resources, and
        abounding in all the gifts of fortune and the emoluments of nature, if he yet lacks virtue
        and the arts that teach virtue, will so much the more forcibly in derision and scorn be cast
        from all association with good men, the richer he is in the other advantages, the greater
        his distinction, and the higher the hopes he has raised." This Comparison, by embellishing
        both </p>

    <p> terms, bringing into relation by a method of parallel description the one man's ineptitude
        and the other's lack of cultivation, has set the subject vividly before the eyes of all.
        Moreover the Comparison is presented in the form of a detailed parallel because, once the
        similitude has been set up, all like elements are related. <note type="margin" n="61">61</note> ,<milestone unit="section" n="48"/>XLVIII.
        In Comparisons we must carefully see to it that when we present the corresponding idea for
        the sake of which we have introduced the figure we use words suited to the likeness. The
        following is an example: "Just as the swallows are with us in summer time, and when driven
        by the frost retire, ..." Keeping the same comparison, and using Metaphor, we now say: "so
        false friends are with us in a peaceful season of our life, and as soon as they have seen
        the winter of our fortune, they fly away, one and all." But the invention of Comparisons
        will be easy if one can frequently set before one's eyes everything animate and inanimate,
        mute and articulate, wild and tame, of the earth, sky, and sea, wrought by art, chance, or
        nature, ordinary or unusual, and can amongst these hunt out some likeness which is capable
        of embellishing or proving or clarifying or vivifying. The resemblance between the two
        things need not apply throughout, but must hold on the precise point of comparison. <note

            Italy in the middle of 87, and soon thereafter received from Cinna the proconsular
            imperium and the fasces; he held the consulship for the seventh time in January 86 for a
