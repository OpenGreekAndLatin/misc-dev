                    <p> GENERAL INTRODUCTION The three works contained in this volume, though
                        commonly ascribed by the MSS. to Caesar, are nowadays generally regarded as
                        of uncertain authorship and though any detailed presentation of the evidence
                        would occupy too much space, some brief discussion of the problem seems
                        called for. Even as early as the beginning of the second century of our era
                        there were doubts about their authorship <app n="1">
                            <note>1 Suetonius: Life of Caesar (Holland's Translation): ' For of the
                                Alexandrine, African and Spanish Wars, who was the writer it is
                                uncertain; while some think it was Oppius, others Hirtius, who also
                                made up and finished the last of the Gallic War.'</note>
                        </app>; and certainly the unity of their theme and the fact that they all
                        three virtually formed a continuation of the Civil Wars may easily account
                        for the early tradition that Caesar wrote them. Now the style of de Bello
                        Alexandrino is, as Klotz <app n="2">
                            <note>2 Cäsarstudien (1910), pp. 180-204.</note>
                        </app> demonstrated in great detail, very similar to the style of the
                        eighth, and last, book of the Gallic Wars, which is very commonly attributed
                        to Hirtius. The opening chapter of this eighth book contains the following
                        sentence <app n="3">
                            <note>3 As translated by H. J. Edwards: Loeb Classical Library.</note>
                        </app>: ' I have tacked a supplement to the Commentaries of our great Caesar
                        on the operations in Gaul . . . and his last work (i.e. the Civil Wars),
                        which was left unfinished from the </p>
                    <pb n="viii"/>
                    <p> operations at Alexandria onwards, I have completed as far as the conclusion,
                        not indeed of civil discord, of which we see no end, but of Caesar's life.'
                        This certainly appears to confirm what seems likely on stylistic grounds,
                        namely that, if it was Hirtius who completed the Gallic Wars, it was Hirtius
                        also who wrote de Bello Alexandrino. If he did so, his knowledge of the
                        campaign was second-hand; for later in the same chapter he says: ' For
                        myself, I had not the fortune ever to take part in the Alexandrian and the
                        African campaign.' <app n="1">
                            <note>1 He goes on to remark that these two campaigns are partially
                                known to him from conversations with Caesar; and as he may well have
                                had access to Caesar's note-books, it does not seem impossible that
                                he was the author of de Bello Alexandrino.</note>
                        </app> Was he then also the author of de Bello Africo and de Bello
                        Hispaniensi? His words—' as far as the conclusion of Caesar's life ' may
                        indeed be so interpreted. The internal evidence, however, seems strongly
                        against this theory, and suggests, on the contrary, that the three works are
                        the independent productions of three separate hands, none of which was
                        Caesar's own. For anyone who reads the Latin text carefully must surely be
                        forcibly struck by certain idiosyncrasies of style peculiar to one of the
                        books, but not apparent in either of the other two. Thus, to cite but one
                        example, the author of de Bello Hispaniensi—quite apart from his quotations
                        from Ennius—constantly employs the adverb been as a </p>
                    <pb n="ix"/>
                    <p> mere intensive particle, as in the recurrent phrase been magna pars; while
                        the author of de Bello Afuco has a passion for the word interim, and can
                        seldom think of any alternative with which to introduce a new chapter.
                        Neither of these foibles is common in the other work, nor do they occur to
                        any extent in de Bello Alexandrino. Accordingly, though many scholars
                        nowadays are disposed to accept Hirtius as the author of de Bello
                        Alexandrino, few still contend that he wrote the other two works, at any
                        rate in the form in which they have come down to us. The claims of Asinius
                        Pollio and of Sallust to the authorship of de Bello Africo have each had a
                        brief vogue. Possibly, however, as Bouvet has recently suggested,<app n="1">
                            <note>1 César: La Guerre d' Afrique (1949): Introduction, p. xix. The
                                suggestion, as Bouvet points out, was originally made by
                                Nipperdey.</note>
                        </app> both the de Bello Africo and de Bello Hispaniensi which we possess
                        are in reality no more than rough drafts prepared at the request of Hirtius
                        by two separate soldiers who fought in the respective campaigns; and had he
                        survived, Hirtius would have worked up this ' copy into more effective
                        literary form. The manuscripts on which the text of these three works is
                        based are in the main the same as those which contain the Civil Wars; and
                        most of them are far inferior to those which contain only the Gallic Wars.
                        The most important are: Laurentianus Ashburnhamiensis x-xi century
                        Lovaniensis <app n="2">
                            <note>2 This MS. breaks off abruptly in chapter 33 of de Bello
                                Africo.</note>

                        Vindobonensis .xii century Neapolitanus .xii-xiii century Their relations to
                        one another have already been discussed by Peskett in his Introduction to
                        the Civil Wars in this series. For de Bello Alexandrino and de Bello Africo
                        the text which these MSS. afford is reasonably sound but for de Bello
                        Hispanicnse it is far otherwise. Rice Holmes was perhaps not overstating the
                        case when he wrote:<app n="1">
                            <note>1 The Roman Republic: vol iii, p. 298.</note>
                        </app> ' Bellum Hispanicnse is the worst book in Latin literature; and its
                        text is the most deplorable. The language is generally ungrammatical and
                        often unintelligible. The copyists performed their tasks so ill that in the
                        forty-two paragraphs there are twenty-one gaps and six hundred corrupt
                        passages, which Mommsen and lesser men have striven with an industry worthy
                        of a better cause to restore.' In these circumstances the task of producing
                        a readable translation has proved no easy one; the less so since this series
                        allows little scope for explanatory notes. Hence, though I have generally
                        adhered to the MS. reading wherever it seemed reasonably satisfactory, I
                        have not hesitated in many places to adopt conjectural emendations, so as to
                        produce as continuous and intelligible a rendering as possible. The more
                        important departures from the text I have </p>
                    <pb n="xi"/>
                    <p> indicated, with due acknowledgements, in brief footnotes below the Latin. In
                        view of the independent character of these three military monographs, linked
                        together though they are by a common theme, it has seemed best to give to
                        each a separate introduction of its own and, in the case of de Bello
                        Alexandrino, to include a brief summary of the concluding chapters of Civil
                        Wars, Book III, of which it is a continuation. A separate index of personal
                        and place names contained in each work has been placed at the end of the
                        book, followed by a combined subject index and six maps. Certain problems
                        which are too unwieldy for footnotes—mainly topographical, sometimes
                        controversial—are discussed in four appendixes. Among various other works
                        and editions which have proved helpful acknowledgement is due in particular
                        to Rice Holmes' The Roman Republic, Bouvet's La Guerre d'Afrique and Klotz's
                        Kommentar zum Bellum Hispaniense. Unfortunately the recent edition in the
                        Budé series—Guerre d' Alexandrie by J. Andrieu (1954)—reached me only when
                        my own final proofs Mere being revised: hence only the briefest references
                        to it have been possible. </p>

                            <note>1 The date is entirely conjectural. The average estimate seems to
                                be some time in June (Holmes, The Roman Republic, vol. III, p. 204
                                'about the 7th of June'. Andrieu, Guerre d' Alexandria, p. 83, 'at

                                vol. 28. pp. 19-40), argues in favour of an earlier date and

                    <p> INTRODUCTION THE battle of Pharsalus, fought in August 48, was a crushing
                        defeat for the Pompeians, but not finally decisive. Fifteen thousand men
                        were said to have perished: more than twenty-four thousand to have been
                        captured. Their field army was indeed shattered; but both leader and cause
                        yet survived. There were several quarters of the Roman world where
                        resistance might be renewed successfully in the name of senatorial
                        government: the province of Africa, where King Juba of Numidia was a
                        formidable, if exacting, supporter of the Pompeians, and where, since
                        Curio's defeat in the previous year, Caesar's prestige had ebbed; Spain,
                        where Pompey's name still stood high, while Caesar's cause had suffered from
                        the prolonged misgovernment of his deputy, Q. Cassius; and. closer at hand,
                        Egypt, an independent kingdom whose rulers were indebted to Pompey for past
                        services and so might be expected to succour him now. But Egypt—important to
                        Rome as a prolific source of corn—was now faced with a constitutional
                        crisis. The late king, Ptolemy Auletes, had been expelled in 58 but
                        reinstated three years later by Gabinius, acting in the interests of the
                        triumvirs— Caesar, Pompey and Crassus—who were still awaiting payment for
                        this service. An unofficial Roman army of occupation, comprising many
                        soldiers who had once served under Pompey, still remained in the country. In
                        51 Ptolemy had died, bequeathing </p>

                    <p> his throne jointly to his elder son—a mere boy— and his eldest daughter,
                        Cleopatra, and urging the Senate in his will to ensure that its terms were
                        faithfully observed. Nevertheless, Cleopatra had been driven out by the
                        young king's regents, only to raise an army in Syria, return at its head,
                        and confront her brother at Pelusium. In such a situation Pompey's arrival
                        was hardly opportune. To the young king's unscrupulous regents, menaced as
                        they were by Cleopatra and her adherents, his motives were obscure. Had he
                        in mind to win over the Roman occupation troops and conquer the country? And
                        anyway, was not Caesar's cause now for them the better risk? Thus possibly
                        they argued: and, untroubled by scruples, accordingly contrived his murder,
                        the treacherous character of which shocked the whole world and gave to
                        Pompey the status of a martyr. Three days later Caesar arrived to find his
                        foremost rival thus destroyed. But others remained: prompt action was
                        advisable both in Asia, whither Domitius had already been despatched, and in
                        Africa, to crush the remnants of his opponents. However, the seasonal winds
                        off Alexandria prevented any immediate departure; and he might utilise the
                        interval by settling the dispute over the royal succession and collecting
                        the moneys long owing to the triumvirs. But if he argued thus he failed to
                        take into account two factors: first, the natural feelings of the Egyptians
                        and the resentment they might show at his official interference in their
                        domestic affairs: and secondly, the charms of Cleopatra. Of these two
                        important factors the former is duly mentioned by Caesar himself, whereas
                        the </p>

                    <p> latter is studiously glossed over in de Bello Alexandrino. Yet what other
                        reason can account for Caesar's strange inaction between March, when he made
                        himself master of Alexandria and Egypt, and June, when at last he left for
                        Syria to conduct a whirlwind campaign against Pharnaces? Where later writers

                        merit de Bello Alexandrino, though in general a plain and somewhat
                        pedestrian tale, is the best of the three works. If it never soars to the
                        heights, it never sinks to the depths of de Bello Hispaniensi. The subject
                        matter is well arranged, and Caesar's victory at Zela provides an effective
                        climax. The facts presented seem reasonably accurate and undistorted by

                        dramatic and is at pains on occasion to work up the reader's interest before

                        <p> SUMMARY OF THE NARRATIVE IN CIVIL WARS BOOK III CHAPTER 103 Pompeius
                            arrives at Pelusium with 2,000 armed men. Here the young king Ptolemaeus
                            is waging war with his sister, Cleopatra, whom he has expelled a few
                            months before. Pompeius sends messengers to the king begging him to
                            shelter him in return for the services which Pompeius had once rendered
                            the late king. 104 The young king's regents give the messengers a fair
                            reply but secretly plot to murder Pompeius. Achillas, the king's
                            prefect, and Septimius, a military tribune, assassinate him as he comes
                            ashore in a small boat. 106 Caesar arrives at Alexandria with two
                            legions (3,200 men) and 800 cavalry, and with ten warships from Rhodes
                            and a few from Asia. He hears of the death of Pompeius and lands with
                            the fasces borne in front of him. The Alexandrians take affront at this,
                            asserting that the royal authority is being infringed. Frequent riots
                            take place on the following days and several of Caesar's soldiers are
                            killed. 107 Caesar sends to Asia for further legions levied from
                            Pompeian troops; for the Etesian winds prevent his sailing away from
                            Alexandria. He decides that the quarrel between Ptolemaeus and Cleopatra
                            must be composed and requests them both to disband their armies and
                            settle their differences by legal means. 108 Pothinus, the chief regent,
                            is indignant at his interference, secretly summons the king's army to
                            Alexandria, and puts Achillas in command of it. The late king in his
                            will has named as his heirs the elder of his two sons and t he elder of
                            his two daughters, with an appeal to the Roman people to carry out its
                            provisions. </p>

                        <pb n="7"/>
                        <p> 109 Caesar learns of the approach of the king's army under Achillas and
                            decides to remain on the defensive in the town, as his forces are
                            insufficient for a pitched battle. Two envoys sent by the king to
                            Achillas are arrested, and one is killed. Caesar now brings the king
                            under his own control. 110 Achillas has an army of 20,000 men—mainly
                            Roman ex-soldiers from the army of Gabinius who had made their homes in
                            Egypt—as well as exiles and fugitive slaves. This motley army is a power
                            in the land and exercises great political sway. 111 Achillas now tries
                            to occupy all Alexandria which is not already in Caesar's possession. In
                            a fierce battle fought at the harbour Caesar is forced to burn the
                            Alexandrian fleet, so as to deny the enemy its use. 112 Caesar lands
                            troops on the island of Pharos, which controls the passage into the main
                            harbour, and seizes and garrisons it, thereby securing the transport by
                            sea of provisions and reinforcements. Fighting elsewhere in the town is
                            indecisive. He cordons off strategic points and strengthens his defences
                            by night, occupying parts of the palace with the theatre adjoining it,
                            and thus gaining access to the port and docks. Arsinoe, the younger
                            princess, joins Achillas and bids against him for the favour of the
                            troops. Pothinus is executed by Caesar when some of his messengers, sent
                            to encourage Achillas in his resistance, are captured. This is the
                            beginning of the Alexandrian war. (The reason for including the above
                            summary has been staled in the General Introduction, p. xi.) </p>

                        <p> THE AFRICAN WAR As soon as Caesar had crushed Pharnaces at Zela and
                            temporarily reorganised the affairs of Asia, he might, if military
                            strategy alone had governed his policy, have sailed straight to Africa,
                            where his enemies had had a year already in which to consolidate their
                            position. But Caesar was more than a mere general; and, as he well knew,
                            the political situation in Rome was serious and urgently demanding his
                                presence.<app n="1">
                                <note>1 Bell. Alex. ch. 65.</note>
                            </app> Troubles there were in plenty. Economic problems such as the
                            administration of the new law of debt gave scope to malcontents like
                            Caelius and Dolabella, who had expected harsh reprisals against the
                            defeated Pompeians and were disgusted with Caesar's leniency. Still more
                            dangerous to public security were Caesar's veteran legions, who, having
                            been sent home after Pharsalus, had now little to do save noisily demand
                            their promised triumph and discharge. Antony, the absent dictator's
                            deputy in the city, had found all this unrest beyond his powers
                            effectively to cheek: no magistrates had as yet been elected for the
                            current year, and those for 4G were shortly due for election. Such was
                            the situation which confronted Caesar in September. By November he had
                            restored order: </p>

                        <pb n="140"/>
                        <p> the economic crisis had been temporarily mitigated: the elections had
                            been held: the mutinous legions disciplined and some detailed for
                            service in Africa. But the additional delay was to cost him dear; for
                            not only was he to start his new campaign in the winter, when every
                            convoy from Sicily was at the merey of the winter gales, but. as he was
                            soon to find out, his opponents had made good use of the respite. Since
                            Curio's defeat in 49 the Roman province of Africa had been in the hands
                            of the Pompeians. Its most powerful neighbour, king Juba of Numidia, had
                            no love for Caesar and could accordingly, if his imperious temper were
                            tactfully handled, be relied on to support Caesar's enemies. His
                            military resources were reputed to be enormous and to outweigh by far
                            those of his two Mauretanian neighbours, Bocehus and Bogud. who favoured
                            Caesar, even if the latter were backed up by Sittius, a Roman adventurer
                            who had for several years been operating in those parts with his own
                            private army. Attius Varus, who had governed the province since 50, Avas
                            joined, after Pharsalus, by Scipio and Cato, each with his own
                            contingent of survivors from that battle. Labienus, Petreius and
                            Afranius had now also joined them and in Labienus the enemy had a
                            tactician hardly inferior to Caesar himself. In addition to Juba's four
                            legions and countless cavalry and light-armed troops the Pompeians could
                            muster ten legions, though most of them were raised in Africa and were
                            of dubious quality. They possessed a considerable fleet: they had
                            fortified practically all </p>

                            by calling up many of the native farmers they had curtailed the harvest
                            of 47 and thus made it more difficult for Caesar to live off the land.
                            Caesar's tiny expeditionary force was thus beset with enormous
                            difficulties, not. only of supply and reinforcement, but of very
                            existence and within a week of its landing Labienus came very near to
                            destroying it. The narrative of de Bello Africo bears striking testimony
                            to Caesar's manifold qualities: the dogged patience which strategy
                            demanded in the earlier stages: the outward buoyancy and cheerfulness
                            with which, despite his inward anxiety, he maintained the morale of his
                            troops: the unflagging determination with which he tempted Scipio to
                            engage and the brilliant tactics and opportunism thanks to which at
                            Thapsus he finally turned the tables on his would-be ambusher. Although
                            the identity of the author of de Bello Africo is obscure, certain

                            perspective was weak; for he sometimes gives unimportant, yet at other

                        <p> ANALYSIS OF THE BOOK CHAPTERS 1-2 Preparations at Lilybaeum: Caesar
                            embarks and sails for Africa. 3-6 Arrival at Hadrumetum: its commandant
                            refuses to negotiate: Caesar makes a fighting withdrawal to Ruspina.
                            7-36 Operations near Ruspina Caesar advances to Leptis but retires the
                            next day to Ruspina: arrival of some of his missing transports: Labienus
                            offers battle; Caesar's force is surrounded but fights its way
                            out.—Build-up of defences at Ruspina: shortage of corn: Cato's advice to
                            the young Pompeius and its sequel: Scipio joins Labienus.—King Juba
                            preoccupied by invasion of his country: reports of atrocities stimulate
                            Caesar to prompter action, but he refuses Seipio's challenge to a
                            pitched battle: his reasons for remaining on the defensive.—Garrison
                            sent by Caesar to Acylla: simultaneous arrival of corn and troops. 37-66
                            Operations near Uzitta Description of the terrain SAY. of Ruspina:
                            Caesar begins fortifying the high ground: a cavalry action ensues: he
                            offers battle in the plain, but Scipio declines.—A centurion from one of
                            Caesar's convoys defies Scipio: conditions in Caesar's camp: an
                            unseasonable storm.—Juba joins Scipio with large reinforcements:
                            Caesar's troops not so overawed as was expected.—Both sides prepare to
                            seize more high ground: Labienus lays an ambush: Caesar captures the
                            hill and carries two fortified lines to Uzitta to protect his flanks:
                            Seipio's cavalry heavily repulsed.—Caesar receives further
                            reinforcements', takes disciplinary measures, fortifies a </p>

                            either side: only a cavalry skirmish ensues.—Varus fires some of
                            Caesar's transports at Leptis: Caesar quits his camp and personally
                            leads a successful counterattack.—Foraging operations: Labienus vainly
                            lays another ambush. 67-78 Operations near Aggar Lack of corn prompts
                            Caesar to march to Aggar: Scipio follows.—Caesar captures Zeta but is
                            forced to fight his way back under heavy attacks from Numidian cavalry
                            and light-armed units: he adapts training methods to meet these new
                            tactics: his anxiety about the enemies' cavalry strength and their
                            elephants.—He twice offers battle: captures Sarsura, approaches Thysdra,
                            retires to Aggar.—Cavalry engagement near Tegea. 79-86 Operations at
                            Thapsus Caesar advances to Thapsus and begins to invest the town: Scipio
                            follows and finally encamps close to Thapsus.—Caesar's dispositions: his
                            reluctance to engage: the signal is finally given without his
                            orders.—Rout of Scipio's elephants: Caesar's tronps meet little
                            resistance: sortie of the garrison of Thapsus repulsed.—Savage vengeance
                            by Caesar's veterans on the fugitives.—Vergilius refuses to surrender
                            Thapsus: arrangements for blockading it and Thysdra: Caesar proceeds to
                            Utica. 87-98 Final stages of the campaign Brutal sack of Parada by
                            Scipio's cavalry: they plunder Utica till Cato buys them off: he tries
                            in vain to organise resistance and then commits suicide.—Caesar's
                            clemency: he enters Utica and punishes its Roman citizens by inflicting
                            a heavy fine.—Juba outlawed by his subjects takes refuge with Petreins
                            in a villa.—Caesar comes to Zama: surrender of Thysdra and Thapsus:
                            deaths of Juba, Petreius, Afranius and Scipio.—Caesar returns to Utica
                            and fines Thapsus, Hadrumetum, Leptis and Thysdra: embarks at Utica:
                            calls at Caralis in Sardinia: eventually arrives at Rome. </p>

                        <p> INTRODUCTION THE battle of Thapsus sealed the fate of the Pompeians'
                            venture in Africa. Once again their army had been shattered: their main
                            ally, Juba, was dead: Cato and Scipio had both perished by their own
                            hands: Afranius, Petreius, Faustus Sulla and Considius had all been
                            killed: of the leaders only Varus, Labienus and the two sons of Pompey
                            survived. In Spain lay their last chance of regrouping and making
                            another stand. But this time they were not to enjoy so long a respite in
                            which to consolidate for less than nine months after his victory at
                            Thapsus Caesar was to set foot in Spain for the final reckoning. For two
                            months after the battle Caesar was occupied in reducing the remaining
                            African strongholds, replenishing his finances by inflicting heavy fines
                            upon the prosperous communities which had lately defied him, and
                            reorganising the province and its neighbouring territories. On his
                            return to Rome in July 4G conditions were outwardly more settled than on
                            his previous visit. Honours and offices, including a third dictatorship
                            and a fourth consulship for the ensuing year, were showered upon him,
                            while preparations went ahead for his delayed triumphs. These he
                            celebrated in August with unprecedented magnificence—over Gaul, Egypt,
                            Pontus and Africa; and there appears to have been a general feeling that
                            the last battle of the civil wars had already been </p>

                        <pb n="304"/>
                        <p> fought and that, with Cato's suicide, the struggle to maintain the old
                            order was too futile to pursue. Meanwhile the news from Further Spain
                            was ominous. Since Caesar's brilliant victory at Herda in 49 much had
                            happened to lessen his prestige and revive memories of Pompey's earlier
                            feats of arms in the peninsula. The prolonged misgovernment of Q.
                            Cassius had exasperated the Spaniards and driven several of the Roman
                            legions to open mutiny <note type="footnote" n="1">1 See Bell. Alex.
                                chs. 48-64.</note> and though this had been quelled with but little
                            bloodshed and Cassius had fled, the mischief was done. The mutinous
                            legions, fearing Caesar's retribution, expelled the new governor,
                            Trebonius, and chose Scapula and Aponius as their leaders; and when, in
                            the autumn of 4G, Pompey's elder son, Gnaeus. landed in the province, he
                            was at once elected as their commander. After Thapsus came the
                            refugees—his younger brother. Sextus, and the remnants of the broken
                            armies led by Labienus and Varus; while in Spain itself many of the
                            troops who had once served with Afranius and had been disbanded by
                            Caesar to their homes in Spain now joined his standards. By the end of
                            43 Gnaeus had thirteen legions, though only four were of proved worth
                            and though his own record ill fitted him for the supreme command, yet he
                            had two valuable assets—the magic influence of his father's name and, in
                            Labienus, at least one brilliant and experienced subordinate. Caesar had
                            not been blind to these ever-increasing dangers. Didius had been
                            despatched with a fleet: Pedius and Fabius had been furnished initially
                            with troops from Sardinia and. When these proved in-</p>

                        <pb n="305"/>
                        <p>sufficient, reinforced. But the situation had got out of their control:
                            most of Baetica had gone over to the rebels, and the few remaining loyal
                            communities like Ulia, unable to hold out much longer, kept pending him
                            urgent appeals for help. Early in November 46 Caesar left Rome for
                            Further Spain, where, with a force of eight legions and eight thousand
                            cavalry, he now entered upon what was to prove the final campaign alike
                            of the war and of his own career. Of this campaign, the bloodiest of the
                            war, we have one contemporary account, de Bello Hispaniensi —perhaps the
                            most illiterate and exasperating book in classical literature. Who wrote
                            it is unknown but he appears to have been one of the combatants <note

                            Macaulay's guess that he was some ' sturdy old centurion who fought
                            better than he wrote ' is possibly not far off the truth. In view of the
                            sorry state of the MSS. tradition it is difficult to assess accurately
                            his historical and literary merits: all that can be attempted here is a
                            brief and general survey of his qualities. As a military commentator he
                            lacks a sense of proportion for while he describes—-often at some
                            length—all kinds of engagements, including quite minor skirmishes,<note
                                type="footnote" n="2">2 e.g. ch. 13, 21, 27.</note> as well as

                                21, 27.</note> desertions and even apparent trivialities,<note

                                27.</note> yet he throws little light on problems of supply,<note

                            reasons for the various manoeuvres. <note type="footnote" n="2">2 Thus,
                                while he accounts for Gnaeus's taking the field at Munda in ch. 28,
                                he gives no reasons for the manoeuvres of ch. 27.</note> His grasp
                            of tactics seems, in fact, negligible.<note type="footnote" n="3">3 e.g.
                                in ch. 29 his strange assumption that the Caesarians expected the

                                but only 3 Caesarians killed and ch. 23, where after desperate
                                hand-to-hand fighting Caesarian casualties are two dead and several
                                wounded.</note> sometimes reflects the partisan but in other
                            respects, wherever his narrative can be compared with the brief accounts
                            of later writers, it appears in the main to be reasonably trustworthy.
                            His presentation of his material is not always effective. He tries hard
                            to follow a chronological sequence and, when it occurs to him to do so.
                            he quotes a date.<note type="footnote" n="5">5 e.g. ch. 19, 27, 31,
                                39.</note> But this day-by-day system often involves a mere
                            eatalogue of disconnected incidents.<note type="footnote" n="6">6 e.g.
                                ch. 10, 11, 13, 20.</note> Nor is his chronology always accurate:
                            not seldom he forgets to mention something in its proper place and so
                            has to go back.<note type="footnote" n="7">7 e.g. ch. 10: 'I forgot to
                                mention in its proper place '; moreover, he appears to have coined a
                                special phrase for such emergencies, if the recurrent words hoc
                                praeterito tempore mean, as they seem to. ' just before this time

                            lieutenants. 3-5 Caesar sends help to Ulia—marches to Corduba, thereby
                            relieving Ulia—crosses the Baetis by a pontoon bridge: indecisive
                            fighting S. of the town. 6-19 Siege of Ategua Pompeius encamps S. of the
                            Salsum—description of his forces and of the terrain—skirmish at Castra

                            skirmishes successfully X. of Salsum—Caesar's cavalry retaliate
                            dismounted—barbarous behaviour of Pompeian garrison: another sally from
                            the town repulsed— Tullius and Cato offer terms which Caesar rejects:
                            further heavy lighting round the town—it surrenders on February 19th.
                            20-26 Operations near Ueubi Pompeius executes Caesarian partisans at
                            Ueubi: party strife at Ursao: skirmish near river Salsum— gallantry of
                            two centurions: battle on high ground near Soricaria — Pompeius repulsed
                            with heavy losses: single combat between Tarpio and Niger: evidence of
                            disaffection in Pompeian army. 27-31 Operations near Munda Both armies
                            move S.—Caesar storms Ventipo— Pompeius burns Carruca—takes held outside

                            ground—Caesar attacks—bitter fighting—the Tenth legion starts the enemy

                    <p> APPENDIX A THE OPERATIONS NEAR UZITTA (African War chapters 37-G6) Although
                        in general the narrative contained in these thirty chapters is clear, yet
                        there remain not a few problems mainly concerned with the identification of
                        positions mentioned in the text. Some of these problems are vital to the
                        interpretation of the text; and as any adequate discussion of them is
                        impossible in brief footnotes they are dealt with here in this appendix. (1)
                        The Identity of the ultimus collis of chapters 37-39 It is of some
                        importance to identify this hill because it has a bearing not only upon the
                        position of both Scipio's and Caesar's camps, but also upon the operations
                        of chapters 49-51. The first sentence of chapter 3S provides the main
                        evidence for its identification. It was, apparently, not the southernmost
                        hill in the chain (Sidi Jeha), but the southernmost of those hills only
                        which contained ancient watch-towers. R. Holmes argued—convincingly, as 1
                        think—that the word unumquemque must imply that Caesar had visited at least
                        three hills before he was not so far from the last one. This argument would
                        suggest Hamadet er Ressa or one of its southern neighbors. To this it has
                        been objected that Caesar could not possibly have covered the distance by
                        night over rough ground and in support of this objection great stress has
                        been laid by some upon the word semihora. But to me it seems unnecessary to
                        connect semihora with Caesar's preliminary reconnaissance: if </p>


                    <pb n="392"/>
                    <p> ea refers to castella, as it would seem to, may not the meaning be simply
                        that, once the preliminary survey and briefing was completed, the temporary
                        re-instatement of the old watch-towers—carried out simultaneously on all the
                        hills by parties of sappers using in the main materials on the spot—was
                        completed in half an hour? As Hamadet er Ressa satisfies the other
                        requirements— proximity to Scipio's camp and the operations described in
                        chapter 49—I accordingly accept this identification. (2) Caesar s Camps and
                        Fortified Lines Three distinct camps are referred to in the text—two main
                        and one subsidiary. The latter is mentioned in the first sentence of chapter
                        51. It was apparently a redoubt, built on Sidi Jeha—possibly on the forward
                        slopes—to command its southern and western approaches. It is marked on Map 4
                        (Uzitta) with the figure 2. In the following sentence of chapter 51 the
                        writer goes on: ' from his main [or possibly ' largest'] camp Caesar
                        proceeded to carry two fortified lines across the centre of the plain
                        towards Uzitta.' I have followed Stoffel and Holmes in locating this main
                        cam]) (numbered 1 in map 4) on the western slopes of the ridge, rather than
                        on the plateau farther east, where Veith and Bouvet place it. The former
                        location agrees better with the statement in chapter 63 that the
                        camp—apparently the main camp—was six miles from Leptis. As to his third
                        camp, there is little dispute about its position described in chapter 56. It
                        was in the plain opposite Uzitta, just out of range of infantry weapons, but
                        within artillery range of the tow n and it was large enough to hold five
                        legions. The approximate location of Caesar's main fortified lines is not
                        seriously disputed. In Map 4 I have marked the initial field-works,
                        described in chapter 38, as running along the crest of the ridge, though the
                        phrase medio iugo might well imply 4 half-way up (the western side of) the
                        ridge '. Their prolongation S.W. to Rhar ed Delta is, I </p>


                    <pb n="393"/>
                    <p> think, implied in chapter 49, though the interpretation of this difficult
                        chapter is much disputed. The words ' he began to advance along the crest of
                        the ridge ' I interpret as a movement S.W. in the direction of Sidi Jeha,
                        which I identify with proximum collem and I interpret the phrase ' capturing
                        the high ground closer to Scipio ' as implying the western slopes of R ha r
                        ed Deba, which might otherwise provide Scipio with a springboard for an
                        enflanking movement. (3) Scipio's Camp The position of this camp is a very
                        vexed question. The main evidence in the text is as follows: ch. 24: Scipio,
                        marching by night from Hadrumetum, joins forces with Labienus and Petreius,
                        and they then establish themselves in a single camp three miles distant
                        (presumably from Caesar's eamp near Ruspina). ch. 38: ' from the last hill
                        and turret, which was nearest the enemy's camp, . . .' chs. 38. 39: ' Scipio
                        and Labienus advanced about a mile from their fortified positions. . . .
                        When Caesar perceived that no more than a mile and a half now separated the
                        enemy line from his own fortifications . . .' (see footnote on p. 396). ch.
                        f>l: ' the town of Uzitta, which was situated in the plain between his own
                        (Caesar's) camp and Scipio's . . .' Commentators have accordingly searched
                        for a suitable site answering the following three requirements: (i) three
                        Roman miles distant from Ruspina; (ii) roughly two and a half Roman miles
                        from Caesar's emplacements on or near the ridge; (Hi) on the far (i.e.
                        western) side of Uzitta. Now it is fairly easy to select two sites which
                        between them shall satisfy all these three conditions; but it is well nigh
                        impossible to select one. Thus R. Holmes, differing </p>


                    <pb n="394"/>
                    <p> but slightly from Veith, places the camp about one and a half miles N.E. of
                        Uzitta, not far from the modern village of Mnara. But this is nearly five
                        Roman miles distant from Caesar's positions at Ruspina, and, moreover, it
                        fails to satisfy the third condition. Bouvet, on the other hand, locates the
                        camp about one mile X.W. of Uzitta, a location which satisfies the third
                        condition but is four Roman miles from the ridge. I would place the camp
                        somewhat closer to the town, though in Map 4 it may perhaps be marked too
                        close, in view of the details—rather ambiguous ones—given in chapter 41:
                        some sort of compromise appears inevitable between these indications and the
                        approximate distance of two and a half Roman miles mentioned above. But this
                        location does not satisfy the first condition: it is about six Roman miles
                        from Ruspina. Henee Bouvet somewhat arbitrarily amends the MSS. reading of
                        III to 17. It was Stoffel who, appreciating the difficulties of satisfying
                        all the stated conditions in a single site, suggested that the camp
                        mentioned in chapter 24 was not the same as the one close to Uzitta. Much
                        scorn has been poured upon this theory, but even so I am inclined to accept
                        it. What Scipio's reasons may have been for moving camp, if in fact he did
                        so. are by no means apparent: a more serious objection to the theory is that
                        the move is quite unmentioned. In this respect the question of Labienus'
                        camp, discussed below, is somewhat parallel; and it is perhaps worth noting
                        that more than one editor, while arguing on the one hand that Scipio could
                        not have moved his camp because no mention is made of the fact, is quite
                        disposed to believe on the other hand that Labienus latterly occupied a
                        separate camp, even though this move too has gone unrecorded. There is, I
                        think, another point in favour of Stoffel's theory. In chapter 30 it is
                        stated that Scipio made almost daily demonstrations in battle array at a
                        distance of some 30U paces from his camp, Caesar being at that time still at
                        Ruspina; and that finally Scipio halted his battle line not so far from
                        Caesar's camp. That he made these </p>


                    <pb n="395"/>
                    <p> demonstrations in no serious spirit and took good care not to run any
                        serious risk is no doubt true: he ran little enough risk in all conscience
                        if Ins camp was then, as Stoffel suggests, near Knais, three miles away from
                        Caesar at Ruspina; but if, even in those days, he was already encamped near
                        Uzitta almost six miles distant, there would seem very little point in
                        demonstrating at a range of some five and a half miles. For these reasons I
                        am inclined to accept Stoffel's theory in order to justify my location of
                        Scipio's camp near Uzitta. (4) Juba's Camp There is little evidence in the
                        text for its position, nor is the matter of any great moment. In chapter 48
                        it is stated that the king pitched a separate camp not far from Scipio. The
                        statement in chapter 52 that Caesar's cavalry drove the Numidians right back
                        to the royal camp seems to me inconclusive: Veith inferred from this that it
                        was nearer than Scipio's camp to Uzitta; but the opposite conclusion might,
                        I think, be drawn from the word usque. (5) Labienus' Camp Whereas it is
                        clear from chapter 24 that while Caesar was still at Ruspina Labienus shared
                        a single camp with Scipio and Petreius, there are certain indications that
                        at a later period he was operating from a camp situated to the south of the
                        plain. Thus in the last sentence of chapter 49 we read that * Labienus too
                        had made up his mind to seize this hill (probably Sidi Jeha), and his closer
                        proximity to it had enabled him to achieve the goal more rapidly.1 Chapter
                        50 implies that he was quite familiar with this southern area; while in
                        chapter 58 it is stated that ' the enemy led forth their entire combined
                        forces from all their camps.' This evidence has led most editors to assume
                        that Labienus latterly had an independent camp to the south- </p>

                        east of the modern village of Djemmal. The battle dispositions described in
                        chapters 59-60 make it difficult to assume that this camp was much farther
                        north: I assume that the phrase * closer proximity ' in chapter 49 refers,
                        not to this main camp, but to some redoubt or advanced post which he
                        occupied at the time. (Note. On pp. 393-4 I have inferred from chs. 38 and
                        39 that Scipio's camp was * roughly two and a half Roman miles from Caesar's
                        emplacements '. But in fact the distance may have been greater, if it is
                        assumed from the second sentence of ch. 39 that Scipio's cavalry,
                        after./'''*'' advancing about a mile, later continued to advance till they
                        were now no more than a mile and a half from Caesar. On this assumption
                        Bouvet's location of Scipio's camp some 4 miles distant from the ridge seems
                        quite defensible so far as this evidence is concerned.) </p>

                        narrative seem to me to be these:— (a) The Purpose and Position of the Fires
                        Holmes thought that they were left burning in Caesar's camps at Corduba. But
                        though that would doubtless have been the orthodox manoeuvre, the author has
                        expressed himself very ambiguously, if that was his meaning. What he appears
                        to say is that the order to light the fires was given after the crossing of
                        the river. To a rear party perhaps? Yet one would have expected the decoy
                        fires to have been most useful in misleading the enemy, had they been alight
                        during, not after, the crossing of the river. The alternative occurs to me
                        that they were lit somewhere south of the river, and in the wrong direction,
                        so as to bring Pompey down from the high ground, but none the less mislead
                        him as to Caesar's route. Klotz merely describes the fires as ' to cover the
                        departure.' </p>


                    <pb n="399"/>
                    <p> (b) How much did Pompey know of Caesar's plans, and why did he at first
                        follow Caesar and then retire to Corduba / Holmes took id in the phrase id
                        cum Pompeius ex perfugis rescisset to refer to Caesar's destination, viz.
                        Ategua. and not (as Stoffel, whom Klotz appears to follow) to the fact that
                        Caesar had now left Corduba. In this I certainly think that Holmes is right;
                        for even if the decoy fires were lit—as Holmes thinks—in Caesar's camps at
                        Corduba, it seems almost incredible that Caesar's army should have crossed
                        the river entirely unobserved by Pompey's outposts. Moreover, if the fires
                        were lit subsequently, south of the river, it can fairly be assumed that
                        Caesar never hoped to keep his departure secret, but only his destination;
                        and that the latter was only now disclosed by deserters. I assume that
                        Pompey followed Caesar with the object of harassing his convoy, but without
                        risking a general engagement. That he met with some success seems to be
                        implied by the words carra complura . . . retrarit; for I accept Klotz's
                        explanation that these were captured from Caesar's convoy. But the reason
                        which Klotz suggests for Pompey's withdrawal to Corduba, viz. ' to protect
                        his troops from the inclemency of the weather', hardly seems adequate; it is
                        more likely, I think, that Pompey had to return to Corduba to revictual his
                        forces, since he was not sure whether his communications with Ategua—well
                        stocked with corn, according to the account given by Dio Cassius—were still
                        open. The following points where my readings vary from those of Klotz are
                        perhaps of less importance for the general interpretation of the narrative:—
                        (1) In support of his reading facultatem liberam sequendi nactus inter
                        moutes et angustias Klotz remarks that the heights which surround the narrow
                        places of the Guadajos valley are about 100 metres above the valley. On the
                        other hand, my reading (based on Mommsen's conjecture) facultatem nactus
                        est, relinquens </p>


                    <pb n="400"/>
                    <p> montis et angustias is, geographically speaking, perhaps no loss possible,
                        and seems more appropriate in view of Caesar's object of bringing Pompey
                        down to the plain. (2) As between Klotz's cuius re Pompeio cum nuntius esset
                        adlatus, eo die proficisci, and my cui de Pompeio cum nuntius esset allatus
                        eo die proficisci, the latter admits a more emphatic interpretation of co
                        die which, to my mind, gives greater point to the following words; namely,
                        that though Caesar was advised of the actual day when Pompey left Corduba,
                        and though he had already made adequate dispositions against any surprise
                        attack, yet a thick morning mist upset his calculations. </p>

                    <p> APPENDIX C THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE ATEGUAN ENVOYS OX THEIR RETURN TO THE TOWN
                        (Spanish War chapter IS) For the first three sentences of this chapter Klotz
                        adopts the following reading:— Remissis legatis, cum ad portam venissent,
                        &lt;constitit&gt; Tib. Tullius, et cum introeuntem Catonem <note
                            type="footnote" n="1">1 C. Antonius MSS.: Catonem Mommsen.</note>
                        insecutus non esset, revertit ad portam et hominem adprehendit, quod
                        Tiberius cum fieri animadvertit, simul pugionem eduxit et manum eius
                        incidit, ita refugerunt ad Caesarem. From the explanation which Klotz gives
                        in his commentary he would seem to interpret as follows:— ' When the envoys
                        had been sent back and had come to the gate. Tiberius Tullius stopped: and
                        as, when Cato was going in. Tiberius did not follow him, Cato turned back to
                        the gate and grabbed the fellow. Observing this action. Tiberius at once
                        drew a dagger and stabbed the other's hand. So they fled back to Caesar.'
                        This reading, which is very close to the MSS., is in many ways attractive;
                        but two serious objections can, I think, reasonably be made to the sense it
                        gives. (i) Why should both men flee back to Caesar? Klotz suggests that '
                        they did not return to the town, probably because they were not sure of the
                        comnian- </p>



                    <pb n="402"/>

                    <p> dant.' But when they had just fallen out—presumably over the question of the
                        terms of surrender— and one had stabbed the other, it seems unlikely that
                        both would flee to Caesar. (ii) The phrase quod Tiberius eum fieri
                        auimadvertit seems to me inappropriate as applied to a man in the very act
                        of being grabbed: on the contrary, it suggests a third party witnessing an
                        action in which he is not immediately involved. My own belief is that there
                        were three envoys, not two; that the MSS. reading C. Antonius has partially
                        preserved an original Catonem Antonius; and that at the beginning of ch. 17
                        Lusitano is a corruption of et Antonio. On this assumption the narrative
                        seems much easier to follow. Caesar had apparently rejected conditional
                        terms of surrender. Tiberius and Antonius may have favoured unconditional
                        surrender but have been overruled by Cato. By the time they reached the town
                        they may have realised that Cato might denounce them to the commandant as
                        traitors; and when he resorted to force, they sought safety with Caesar.
                        That they later returned to the town and Cato was won over to their view is
                        implied at the ena of ch. 19. </p>

                            following argument it is assumed that the town referred to in the
                            greater part of this chapter is Ursao (Osuna), mentioned later in the
                            book in close connection with Munda. Madvig and Glandorp, among others,
                            held this view. Klotz, however, who identities Munda with Montilla (35
                            miles N. E. of Osuna), assumes (Kommentar zum Bellum Hispaniense, p. 80)
                            that the reference here is to a town named Bursao, of unknown situation
                            in Baetica.</note> (Spanish War chapter 22) Party strife seems to me to
                        be the key to this difficult chapter. For though the existence of a
                        Caesarian party in Ursao is nowhere mentioned, and in chapter 28 its
                        inhabitants are described as supporters of Gnaeus, yet in view of the
                        conditions at Ueubi (ch. 20-21), Corduba (ch. 34) and Carteia (ch. 37) this
                        hypothesis appears reasonable. On this assumption the incidents described
                        may, I think, be explained as follows. The fall of Ategua—Gnaeus's strongest
                        garrison—must have had important effects; for it strengthened the hand of
                        Caesar's partisans in all the towns, and increased the strategic value of
                        those hi the south, particularly Ursao. The anxiety of Gnaeus is obviously
                        reflected in his purge of the opposing faction at Ueubi. Now Ursao was at
                        this time divided in its allegiance and, as it lay some distance to the
                        south, Gnaeus had not yet detached any troops to hold it, though he had in
                        mind to do so (cf. ch. 26). Caesar was anxious that its inhabitants should
                        learn how the Pompeian garrison at Ategua had behaved and accordingly had
                        the envoys—clearly Caesarian partisans—escorted to the town; and the high </p>



                    <pb n="404"/>
                    <p> rank of the members of this escorting party emphasises the importance of
                        their mission. They may have been empowered to treat directly with the
                        townsmen if the latter decided to join Caesar. But the Pompeian partisans
                        seem to have persuaded their fellow-citizens as a whole that the envoys were
                        liars in the pay of Caesar, and so procured the massacre of all but two of
                        them before they could rejoin Caesar's deputation. Later on—no doubt at the
                        instance of the Caesarian faction—a fact-finding commission was despatched
                        to Ategua and on its return confirmed the envoy's report. A revulsion of
                        feeling now set in and the Caesarians demanded vengeance on the Pompeian
                        partisan who had misled them and. by butchering the envoys, ruined their
                        chances of a composition with Caesar. At this crisis the man appears to have
                        duped his opponents very thoroughly. Affecting remorse, he sought to leave
                        the town, pretending that he would explain to Caesar that the massacre was a
                        genuine mistake committed in ignorance of the true facts of the case. But
                        once clear of the town he collected sufficient reinforcements to enable him
                        to massacre all his leading opponents and thus secure Ursao's allegiance to
                        Gnaeus. The last sentence of the chapter is particularly difficult to
                        interpret. I myself believe that it refers, not to Ursao, but to Ucubi.<note

                        on, and its distance from Baeturia was not much less. Deserters from
                        Caesar's army would surely make for Ueubi; and Pompeian refugees from Ueubi
                        would not have far to go to cross the Baetis. It is not, I think, necessary
                        to assume a gap in the text to account for the change in scene: harsh though
                        it certainly is, it is perhaps not beyond the powers of the author.
                        Elsewhere he uses the phrase hoc praeterito tempore to alter the scene as
                        well as the time (e.g. the opening words of this same chapter; also ch. 20):
                        his recurrence, in </p>

                    <p> chapter 21, to events at Ueubi is quite sudden and oppidum is left
                        unspecified; while in chapter 34 he switches harshly (oppido . . . oppidum)
                        from Corduba to Munda. If it is Ueubi to which he here refers, his narrative
                        seems easier to follow. The goods being sold are those of Caesar's partisans
                        in the town: all Pompey's troops are virtually confined to camp lest,
                        following the example of the civilian refugees, they desert fully armed:
                        morale in the town and camp is low and—if the text can be trusted— deserters
                        from Caesar's side are discouraged to the extent of being embodied only in
                        the low-paid light-armed units. ADDITIONAL NOTE (Spanish War, ch. 20, p.
                        359) In two passages in this short despatch the interpretation given by
                        Klotz in his commentary is as follows:— (i) Reading ' nostrisque adhue freti
                        praesidiis ', he renders ' relying on the strong places until now belonging
                        to us ', explaining that the allusion is in particular to the provisions
                        Casesar had captured at Ategua. (ii) Reading " profecto nostro commeatu
                        privati necessario ad dimicandum descendent ' he apparently renders '
                        assuredly, when they are deprived of the provisions we have collected (.sc.
                        and have fallen into their hands), they will of necessity come down to
                        tight'. This interpretation does, I admit, considerably improve the general
                        sense; but whether the Latin text can in either case be fairly thus
                        interpreted seems open to doubt. </p>

                    <p> THE ALEXANDRIAN WAR <note type="margin" n="1"/> WHEN the Alexandrian war
                        flared up, Caesar summoned every fleet from Rhodes and Syria and Cilicia:
                        from Crete he raised archers, and cavalry from Malchus, king of the
                        Nabatacans, <app n="1">
                            <note>1 A people of Arabia Petraea.</note>
                        </app> and ordered artillery to be procured, corn despatched, and auxiliary
                        troops mustered from every quarter. Meanwhile the entrenchments were daily
                        extended by additional works, and all those sectors of the town which
                        appeared to be not strong enough were provided with shelters and mantlets;
                        battering-rams, moreover, were introduced from one building into the next
                        through holes, and the entrenchments were extended to cover all the ground
                        laid bare by demolitions or gained by force of arms. For Alexandria is
                        well-nigh lire-proof, because its buildings contain no wooden joinery and
                        are held together by an arched construction and are roofed with rough-cast
                        or tiling.<app n="2">
                            <note>2 This seems to be the meaning of pavimentum here: elsewhere it is
                                used only of floors.</note>
                        </app> Caesar was particularly anxious that, by bringing to bear his
                        siege-works and pent-houses, he should isolate from the rest of the city
                        that narrowest part of the town which was most constricted by the barrier of
                        marshland lying to the south: his object being first that, since his army
                        was divided between two sectors of the city, it should be controlled by a
                        single strategy and command secondly, that if they got into difficulties in
                        one sector of the town, assistance </p>
                    <pb n="13"/>
                    <p> and support could be brought from the other sector.<app n="1">
                            <note>1 A much disputed passage. I assume that Caesar already occupied
                                two separate sectors of the city south of Cape Lochias, and these he
                                now intended to join up into one by securing the ground immediately
                                to the south, adjoining the marshy depression.</note>
                        </app> But above all his object was to secure himself abundance of water and
                        fodder: of which, as regards the former, he had but a scanty supply, and, as
                        regards the latter, no stocks whatever and the marshland could afford him
                        bountiful supplies of both. <note type="margin" n="2"/>Not indeed that this
                        occasioned any hesitation or delay on the part of the Alexandrians in
                        concerting their measures. They had in fact despatched emissaries and
                        recruiting officers throughout the entire length and breadth of the
                        territory and kingdom of Egypt for the purpose of holding a levy, and had
                        conveyed into the town a large quantity of weapons and artillery and
                        mustered a countless host. In the city too, no less, vast arms factories had
                        been established. They had, moreover, armed the adult slaves, and these the
                        wealthier owners furnished with their daily food and pay. This numerous
                        force they deployed to guard the fortifications of outlying areas; while
                        they kept their veteran cohorts unemployed in the most frequented quarters
                        of the city so that, no matter in what district fighting occurred, they
                        could be thrown in as fresh and lusty reinforcements. All the streets and
                        alleys were walled off by a triple barricade, built of rectangular stone
                        blocks and not less than forty feet high while as for the lower quarters of
                        the city, these were fortified with very lofty towers, each ten stories
                        high. Besides these there were other towers which they had contrived—mobile
                        ones of the like number of stories: and these, being mounted on wheels with
                        ropes and drought animals attached, they moved along the level <app n="2">

                        was, the city furnished equipment of all kinds. The people themselves were
                        clever and very shrewd, and no sooner had they seen what was being done by
                        us than they would reproduce it with such cunning that it seemed it was our

                        latter, inasmuch as there is not one natural spring in the whole city. The
                        main stream in question,<app n="1">
                            <note>1 This is generally taken to be the Canal (see map).</note>

                        Alexandrians. This circumstance suggested to Ganymedes the possibility that
                        the water supply could be cut off from our troops; who, posted as they were
                        in various quarters of the town to guard our entrenchments, were using water
                        drawn from conduits and cisterns in private buildings. <note type="margin"
                            n="6"/> This plan being once approved, Ganymedes embarked upon a serious
                        and difficult task. Having first blocked up the conduits and sealed off all
                        quarters of the city occupied by himself, he then made haste to draw off a
                        vast quantity of water out of the sea by means of mechanical water-wheels;
                        and this he steadily poured from higher ground into Caesar's area. For which
                        reason the water drawn from the nearest buildings was a little more brackish
                        than usual, and occasioned no little wonder among men as to why this had
                        come about. Nor could they quite believe the evidence of their own ears when
                        their neighbours lower down said that the water they were using was of the
                        same kind and </p>
                    <pb n="19"/>
                    <p> taste as they had previously been accustomed to; and they were openly
                        discussing the matter amongst themselves and, by tasting samples, learning
                        how markedly the waters differed. However, in a short space of time the
                        water nearer the contamination was entirely undrinkable, while that lower
                        down was found to be relatively impure and brackish. <note type="margin"
                            n="7"/> This circumstance dispelled their doubts, and so great was the
                        panic that took hold upon them that it seemed that they were all reduced to
                        a most hazardous plight, and some asserted that Caesar was being slow in
                        giving orders to embark. Others were much more seriously alarmed, on the
                        ground that, in making their preparations for a withdrawal, it was
                        impossible to keep the Alexandrians in the dark, being as they were so short
                        a distance away from them; and with their foes on top of them and pursuing
                        them, no chance was afforded them of retreating to their ships. There was,
                        however, a large number of townsfolk in Caesar's sector, whom Caesar had not
                        evacuated from their homes, because they openly affected loyalty to our side
                        and appeared to have deserted their own folk. Yet. as far as I am concerned,
                        had I now the task of championing the Alexandrians and proving them to be
                        neither deceitful nor foolhardy, it would be a case of many words spent to
                        no purpose: indeed when one gets to know both the breed and its breeding
                        there can be no doubt whatever that as a race they are extremely prone to
                        treachery. <note type="margin" n="8"/> By encouragement and reasoning Caesar
                        allayed his men's alarm, declaring that sweet water could be found in wells
                        and trenches, inasmuch as all seashores naturally possessed veins of sweet
                        water. </p>
                    <pb n="21"/>
                    <p> But if the nature of the sea-shore of Egypt was different from all others,
                        none the less, since they held unfettered command of the sea, while
                        then-enemies had no fleet, they could not be prevented from seeking water
                        daily in their ships, either from Paratonium on their left, or the island on
                        their right <app n="1">
                            <note>1 The places referred to are much disputed and have not been

                                miles W. of Alexandria—too far, it seems, to be intended here. As

                        </app>—voyages which, being in opposite directions, would never be prevented
                        by contrary winds at one and the same time. As for retreating, there was no
                        sound policy in that, not merely for those who held the chief
                        responsibility, but not even for those whose sole concern was for their own
                        lives. They were hard put to it to contain the enemies' frontal attacks from
                        their entrenchments: once abandon those and they could be no match for them
                        either in vantage ground or numbers. Moreover, boarding ships, especially
                        from pinnaces, involved considerable delay and difficulty; while set against
                        this the Alexandrians had the greatest mobility and knowledge of the ground
                        and buildings. These people above all, overweening as they became in
                        victory, would dash ahead and seize the higher ground and the buildings and
                        thus prevent our men from retreating and gaining their ships. Accordingly,
                        they should put that policy out of their minds and reflect that, at all
                        costs, they must win the day. <note type="margin" n="9"/> Having harangued
                        his men to this effect and put fresh heart into them all, he briefed his
                        centurions as follows: they Mere to interrupt their other tasks and turn
                        their attention to digging wells, continuing without any cessation all
                        through the night. Whereupon, the business being once undertaken with
                        unanimous enthusiasm for the task, in the course of </p>
                    <pb n="23"/>
                    <p> that one night a great quantity of sweet water was discovered. Tims the
                        laborious machinations and supreme efforts of the Alexandrians were
                        countered by a few hours' work. In the course of the following day the
                        Thirty-Seventh legion, part of the surrendered remnants of Pompeius' troops,
                        after being embarked by Domitius Calvinus with corn, arms, weapons and
                        artillery, made the coast of Africa a little beyond Alexandria. An East
                        wind, which blew continuously for many days, prevented this Meet from
                        gaining harbour; but the ground throughout all that area gives excellent
                        hold for anchors. And as they were weather-bound for a long time, and hard
                        put to it for lack of water, they informed Caesar by means of a fast boat.
                            <note type="margin" n="10"/> In order to take some personal decision as
                        to what he thought ought to be done, Caesar boarded a ship and ordered his
                        whole fleet to follow him. He did not embark any of our troops, since, as he
                        was going somewhat too far afield, he was loth to leave our entrenchments
                        unmanned. On their arriving at that place which is called Chersonensus,<app

                        bent on plunder, advanced rather too far from the ships and were picked up
                        by enemy cavalry. From them the enemy learned that Caesar himself had
                        arrived with his fleet, without any troops on board. This intelligence
                        prompted the belief among them that fortune had put in their way a great
                        opportunity for scoring a success. Accordingly, they manned with combat
                        troops all the ships they had got in readiness for sailing, and encountered
                        Caesar as he was returning with his fleet. Now there were two reasons why
                        Caesar was loth to fight an action that </p>
                    <pb n="25"/>
                    <p> day: he had no troops on board; and it was now after the tenth hour as the
                        matter now stood, and on the other hand nightfall would, he thought, inspire
                        greater confidence in the enemy, who were relying on their local knowledge.
                        In his own case, also, he would be denied the advantage of encouraging his
                        men, since no encouragement was quite to the point where it was impossible
                        to single out for comment either bravery or slackness. For these reasons
                        Caesar withdrew to land what ships he could, at a point where he supposed
                        that the enemy would not follow them. <note type="margin" n="11"/> There was
                        one Rhodian ship on Caesar's right wing stationed far apart from the rest.
                        As soon as the enemy caught sight of it they could not restrain themselves,
                        and four decked ships and several open ones dashed madly towards it. This
                        vessel Caesar was obliged to succour, to prevent the disgrace of sustaining
                        rough treatment in full view of the enemy; though, if any serious mischance
                        should overtake its crew, he reckoned they would deserve it. Battle was
                        joined, with hard fighting on the part of the Rhodians and though in every
                        fray they had excelled both in seamanship and valour, on this present
                        occasion above all they bore the whole brunt unflinchingly, lest it should
                        seem their fault if any defeat were sustained. And so a highly successful
                        action Mas fought. One enemy quadrireme Mas captured, a second Mas sunk, and
                        two stripped of all their marines in addition, a large number of combat
                        troops was killed aboard the other vessels. If night had not put an end to
                        the action, Caesar would have become master of the entire enemy fleet. This
                        catastrophe utterly demoralised the enemy, and </p>

                    <p> Caesar returned to Alexandria with his victorious fleet, towing the
                        merchant-ships against a gentle head wind. <note type="margin" n="12"/> So
                        shattered were the Alexandrians by this reverse—for they saw that now it was
                        not the bravery of combat troops but the seamanship of sailors that had
                        caused their defeat <app n="1">
                            <note>1 The contrast here appears to lie between combat crews
                                (propugnatores, practically synonymous perhaps with the Greek term
                                epibatae), whose function was that of marines, and navigating crews
                                (classiarii = fleet personnel, sailors, as distinct from marines).
                                Caesar had no marines on board, whereas the Alexandrians had; so
                                that, though Caesar doubtless improvised boarding parties from such
                                sailors as could be spared, he had to rely mainly upon superior

                        had sustained but also increase the number of their ships, their hopes and
                        confidence ran high and they began to repair their old ships and to devote
                        greater care and more earnest attention to this matter. And though they had
                        lost more than a hundred and ten warships in the harbour and docks,<app

                        saw in fact that neither troop reinforcements nor supplies could be conveyed
                        to Caesar if they themselves had a strong fleet apart from which, the men of
                        the city and the coastal district, seamen as they were and trained as such
                        from boyhood by daily practice, were anxious to resort to this their natural
                        and native gift, and were aware how successful they had been with their
                        humble little vessels. Consequently they threw themselves whole-heartedly
                        into the task of equipping a fleet. </p>

                        <note type="margin" n="13"/>There were guardships posted at all the. mouths
                        of the Nile to levy customs dues, and in secret royal dockyards there were
                        old ships which had not seen service afloat for many years. These last they
                        proceeded to repair, while the guardships they recalled to Alexandria. There
                        was a shortage of oars: the roofs of colonnades, gymnasia and public
                        buildings were dismantled, and their beams made to serve as oars. In one
                        ease it was natural ingenuity that helped to bridge the gap, in another the
                        city's resources. In fine it was no lengthy voyaging for which they were
                        preparing; but perceiving that the conflict must take place in the harbour
                        itself they obeyed the dictates of the moment. In a few days, therefore,
                        they surprised everyone by completing 22 quadriremes and 5 quinqueremes, to
                        which they added a considerable number of smaller, open craft; and then,
                        after trying out in the harbour by rowing what each of them could do, they
                        manned them with suitable troops and prepared themselves at all points for
                        the conflict. Caesar had 9 Rhodian ships (10 had been sent, but one had been
                        lost during a voyage, on the coast of Egypt), 8 Pontic, 5 Lycian and 12 from
                            Asia.<app n="1">
                            <note>1 This is somewhat difficult to reconcile with chapter 1, where
                                Syria and Cilicia, as well as Rhodes, are specifically mentioned,
                                and with the statement in Civil Wars III, ch. 100, where it is said
                                that Caesar arrived at Alexandria with ten warships from Rhodes and
                                a few from Asia. Could the missing Rhodian galley be after all the
                                one described in chapter 11? Even so, unless the requisition for
                                additional Rhodian ships had not so far been complied with, the
                                    figure<pb n="29"/> of 9 remains a difficulty. The total of 34

                        confident in the valour of his troops. <note type="margin" n="14"/> Now that
                        the stage was reached when each side was self-confident, Caesar sailed round

                    <p> with his fleet and drew up his ships facing the enemy. On his right wing he
                        posted the Rhodian ships, on his left the Pontic ones, leaving a gap of -400
                        paces between them—a distance which he regarded as adequate for deploying
                        his vessels. Behind this line he arranged his remaining ships in reserve,
                        deciding which should follow each of the former vessels and which ship each
                        should support, and giving orders accordingly. Nor were the Alexandrians
                        hesitant to bring up and array their fleet; posting 22 ships in front, and
                        the remainder in a second line in reserve. Besides these they brought up a
                        large number of smaller craft and pinnaces, equipped with incendiary
                        missiles and combustibles, in the hope that sheer numbers and the shouts and
                        flames might have some effect in intimidating our men. Between the two
                        fleets lay shoals with a narrow intersecting channel (these shoals belong to
                        the region of Africa—in fact they say that half Alexandria is part of
                        Africa); and for quite a long time there was a pause among the actual
                        combatants as they waited to see which side was to begin the passage,
                        inasmuch as it seemed that those who once entered the channel would be more
                        restricted both in deploying their fleet and, if things fared badly, in
                        withdrawing. <note type="margin" n="15"/> The commander of the Rhodian
                        squadron was Euphranor, a man who in point of personality and bravery
                        deserved comparison with our people rather than with the Greeks. Thanks to
                        the great fame which his professional skill and forceful personality
                        enjoyed, the Rhodians chose him to command then-fleet. When he perceived
                        Caesar's hesitation, he said: ' It seems to me, Caesar, that you are afraid </p>
                    <pb n="33"/>
                    <p> that, if you once sail into these shoals with your leading flotilla, you may
                        be forced to fight before you can deploy the rest of your fleet. Leave it to
                        us: we shall bear the brunt of the fighting—we won't let you down—until the
                        others can come up with us. Certainly for these fellows to go on boasting
                        yonder in our sight is a sore disgraee and mortification to us.' Caesar
                        offered him encouragement and paid him every tribute of praise, and then
                        gave the signal for battle. Four Rhodian ships advanced beyond the shoals to
                        be at once surrounded and attacked by the Alexandrians. The Rhodians bore up
                        and by skill and dexterity deployed their line; and of such powerful effect
                        was their training that despite the odds not one of them exposed its
                        broadside to the enemy, not one had its oars swept away, but they always met
                        the oncoming foe head-on. Meanwhile the remaining ships came up with them.
                        Then through lack of sea room skill had perforce to be sacrificed and the
                        whole struggle devolved on courage. And indeed there was not one man in
                        Alexandria, either of our troops or of the townsfolk, whose attention was
                        bespoken with either work or fighting, but he made for the loftiest
                        roof-tops and from out of all the vantage points chose one from which to
                        view that spectacle, and besought the immortal gods with prayers and vows to
                        grant victory to his side. <note type="margin" n="16"/>The issues involved
                        in the struggle were by no means equal. On our side no chance of escape
                        either by land or sea was presented in the event of repulse and defeat,
                        while victory would in no way settle the question; whereas in their case, if
                        their fleet should gain the upper hand, they would hold all the cards, while
                        if they were beaten, it would still be left to </p>
                    <pb n="35"/>
                    <p> them to try their luck again. At the same time it seemed a grievous shame
                        that the supreme issue and the salvation of all should be decided by the
                        rival exertions of so few; and if any one of these wavered in purpose or
                        courage, the others too, who had had no chance of fighting to defend
                        themselves, would have to look out for themselves. These considerations
                        Caesar had repeatedly explained to his men in recent days, that they might
                        fight with the greater resolution because they saw that the safety of all
                        was entrusted to themselves. It was by these same arguments too that every
                        man, as he escorted his messmate, friend or acquaintance, implored him not
                        to prove false to the estimate which not only he himself had formed of him,
                        but all those others likewise, to whose decision he owed it that he was now
                        going forth as one of the chosen combatants. Consequently such was the
                        resolute spirit with which the battle was contested that the Alexandrians,
                        albeit a maritime and seafaring folk, derived no assistance from their
                        dexterity and skill, nor did they benefit from their superiority in number
                        of ships, nor could their men, though chosen for their bravery from so vast
                        a multitude, match the bravery of our men. In this battle one quinquereme
                        and a bireme were captured with their combat crews and rowers, and three
                        were sunk, all our ships being unharmed. The rest of their ships fled to the
                        nearby town, where the townsmen, from stations on the moles and adjacent
                        buildings, protected them and prevented our men from approaching at all
                        close. <note type="margin" n="17"/> To prevent the possibility of this kind
                        of thing occurring to him too frequently, Caesar thought that he ought at
                        all costs to make an effort to gain control </p>

                            <note>1 According to Civil Wars III, ch. 112, Caesar had already seized
                                Pharos and placed a garrison in it; but this may have been only the
                                eastern tip, where the lighthouse stood, commanding the entrance to
                                the Great Harbour.</note>
                        </app> and the mole extending to it. For as his entrenchments in the town
                        were in the main completed, he was confident that a simultaneous attempt
                        could be made against both island and city. Having formed this plan, he
                        embarked in smaller craft and pinnaces ten cohorts, some picked light-armed
                        troops and such of his Gallic cavalry as he deemed suitable; and, to
                        distract the enemy garrison, he launched an attack with decked ships upon
                        the other side of the island, offering large rewards to the first to capture
                        it. At first the islanders held off our troops' attack, simultaneously
                        fighting back from the roofs of buildings, and with equal success defending
                        the beaches with armed parties—and there the roughness of the ground did not
                        afford our troops an easy approach—-and guarding the narrow waters with
                        pinnaces and five warships displaying both speed and skill. But as soon as
                        our men had become acquainted with the ground and tried out the shallows, a
                        few got a footing on the beach, others followed in their wake, and a
                        determined attack was launched upon those of the enemy who were drawn up
                        against us on the level foreshore; whereupon the men of Pharos all turned
                        tail. Following their rout the enemy abandoned their defence of the harbour,
                        brought their ships to the built-up area by the water-front, and hastily
                        disembarked to defend the buildings. <note type="margin" n="18"/> They could
                        not, however, hold on so very long with the defences these afforded, though
                        the buildings were of a type not unlike those of Alexandria—to employ a
                        flattering comparison—with a continuous line of lofty towers taking the
                        place of a wall; and our troops had not come equipped with ladders or </p>
                    <pb n="39"/>
                    <p> wicker screens or any other equipment for assault. But panic robs men of
                        their sense and reason and palsies their limbs and so it happened then. The
                        very men who on level and unbroken ground were confident they were a match
                        for us, none the less, utterly demoralised now by the flight of their
                        fellows and the slaughter of a few, did not venture to take up a position on
                        buildings thirty feet high, but at various points along the mole dived into
                        the sea and swam the intervening 800 paces to the safety of the town. Many
                        of these, notwithstanding, were captured or killed; indeed, the number of
                        captives amounted all told to six thousand. <note type="margin" n="19"/>
                        After granting his soldiers leave to plunder, Caesar ordered the buildings
                        to be demolished. Near the bridge—the one closer to Pharos—he fortified a
                        redoubt, and posted a garrison there. This bridge the inhabitants of Pharos
                        had abandoned in their flight; while the other one, which was narrower and
                        closer to the town, was guarded by the Alexandrians. However, on the next
                        day he attacked it from a similar motive, because the possession of these
                        two bridges seemed likely to do away with all the sallies and sudden forays
                        of the enemies' ships. And by now he had dislodged the members of its
                        garrison with artillery and arrows shot from his ships, had driven them back
                        into the town, and put ashore approximately three cohorts—the confined space
                        would not afford a footing for more—while the rest of his forces remained at
                        their posts aboard the ships. At this stage he ordered the bridge to be
                        screened by a rampart on the side facing the enemy, and the opening for the
                        passage of ships—formed by an arch which supported the bridge—to be filled
                        up and </p>
                    <pb n="41"/>
                    <p> blocked with stones. The latter task being completed, so that not a single
                        pinnace could come out, and the former one being under way, all the
                        Alexandrians' forces burst out of the town and took post in a fairly open
                        position over against our fortifications of the bridge; while at the same
                        time they drew up near the mole the vessels which they had been in the habit
                        of sending out under the bridges to set fire to our transports. And so the
                        battle proceeded, with us fighting from the bridge and the mole, and with
                        them from the area facing the bridge and from their ships opposite the mole.
                            <note type="margin" n="20"/> While Caesar was occupied with this
                        situation, and as he was encouraging the troops, a large number of rowers
                        and seamen left our warships and suddenly landed on the mole. Some were
                        inspired by their anxiety to watch the fray, others also by the desire to
                        take part in it. They began by driving back the enemy vessels from the mole
                        with stones and slings, and it seemed that their heavy volleys of missiles
                        were having great effect. But when a few Alexandrians ventured to disembark
                        beyond that point, on the side of their unprotected flank, then, just as
                        they had advanced in no set order or formation and without any particular
                        tactics, so now they began to retire haphazardly to the ships. Encouraged by
                        their retreat, more of the Alexandrians disembarked and pursued our
                        flustered men more hotly. At the same time those who had stayed aboard the
                        warships made haste to seize the gang-planks and ease the ships away from
                        land, to prevent the enemy from gaining possession of them. All this
                        thoroughly alarmed our troops of the three cohorts which had taken post on
                        the bridge and the tip of the mole; </p>
                    <pb n="43"/>
                    <p> and as they heard the clamour behind them, and saw the retreat of their
                        comrades, and sustained a heavy frontal barrage of missiles, they feared
                        they might be surrounded in rear and have their retreat entirely cut off by
                        the departure of their ships and so they abandoned the entrenchment they had
                        begun at the bridge, and doubled frantically to the ships. Some of them
                        gained the nearest ships, only to be capsized by the weight of so many men:
                        some were killed by the Alexandrians as they put up a forlorn and bewildered
                        resistance; some proved luckier in reaching ships at anchor cleared for
                        action, and so got away safely; and a few, holding their shields above them
                        and steeling their resolution to the task, swam off to ships near by. <note
                            type="margin" n="21"/> So long as by words of encouragement Caesar was
                        able to keep his men at the bridge and its emplacements, he too was involved
                        in the same danger; but when he perceived that they were all retreating, he
                        withdrew to his own vessel. As a large number of men followed him and kept
                        forcing their way aboard it, and as no opportunity was afforded either of
                        navigating it or easing it off shore, anticipating what actually happened he
                        dived from the vessel and swam to those ships which were hove to farther
                        off. From them he sent pinnaces to the help of his men who were in
                        difficulties, and saved not a few. His vessel was in fact capsized by the
                        large number of troops, and foundered with the men on board. In this battle
                        the losses among the legionary troops amounted to approximately 400, with a
                        slightly larger number of seamen and rowers. The Alexandrians reinforced the
                        redoubt there with strong entrenchments and many pieces of artillery and </p>
                    <pb n="45"/>

                        to despatch their vessels. <note type="margin" n="22"/> This reverse, so far
                        from dismaying our troops, fired and stimulated them to carry out
                        large-scale sallies in the course of storming the enemy's defence-works.
                        Every day encounters took place, and whenever a chance, offered itself and
                        the Alexandrians burst out in a frontal sally and gave Caesar an opportunity
                        of engaging battle, he achieved considerable success, thanks to the
                        excellent morale and ardent enthusiasm of his troops; nor could his
                        widespread words of encouragement keep pace with the legions' exertions or
                        their eagerness for fighting, so that they had to be deterred and held back
                        from the most hazardous encounters rather than be spurred on to fight. <note
                            type="margin" n="23"/> The Alexandrians saw that the Romans were
                        heartened by successes and stimulated by reverses, nor were they aware of
                        any third vicissitude of war which could make them yet more steadfast. And
                        so, whether it was they were warned by the king's friends who were in
                        Caesar's camp, or whether they were acting on some previous plan of their
                        own made known to the king by secret despatches and approved by him, —we can
                        only guess at their motive—they sent envoys to Caesar requesting him to
                        release the king and allow him to go over to his own side. ' The whole
                        population ', they said, ' being tired and wearied of the girl, of the

                        <note type="margin" n="24"/> Though Caesar was well aware that they were a
                        deceitful race, always pretending something different from their real
                        intentions, yet he decided that it was expedient to satisfy their plea for
                        clemency, since, if their demands in any way reflected their feelings, then
                        he believed the king would remainloyal when released but if, on the other
                        hand, they wanted to have the king to lead them with a view to waging the
                        war—and that was more in keeping with their character—then he thought there
                        would be greater honour and distinction for him in waging war against a king
                        than against a motley collection of refugees. Accordingly, he urged the king
                        to take thought for the kingdom of his fathers, to have pity on his most
                        illustrious country, shamefully scarred as it was by fire and desolation, to
                        recall his citizens to sanity first and then to preserve them therein, and
                        to prove his loyalty to the Roman people and to Caesar, inasmuch as Caesar
                        himself had such faith in him that he was sending him to join an enemy under
                        arms. Then, grasping his right hand in his own, Caesar made to take leave of
                        the boy—already grown to manhood. But the royal mind, schooled in all the
                        lessons of utter deceit, was loth to fall short of the customary standards
                        of his race and so with tears he proceeded to beseech Caesar to the opposite
                        effect not to send him away: his very kingdom, he declared, was not more
                        pleasing to him than the sight of Caesar. Checking the lad's tears, albeit
                        not unmoved himself, Caesar declared that, if that was the way he felt, they
                        would speedily be reunited, and so sent him back to his people. Like a horse
                        released from the starting-gate and given his head, the king proceeded to
                        wage war against Caesar </p>
                    <pb n="49"/>
                    <p> so energetically that the tears he had shed at their conference seemed to
                        have been tears of joy. Not a few of Caesar's officers and friends and many
                        of the centurions and soldiers were delighted at this turn of events,
                        inasmuch as Caesar's over-generosity had, they felt, been made fun of by the
                        deceitful tricks of a boy. As if indeed it was merely generosity and not the
                        most far-sighted strategy which had led him to do it! <note type="margin"
                            n="25"/> Having got themselves a leader, the Alexandrians observed no
                        greater degree of resolution in themselves or of listlessness in the Romans:
                        in addition, the fun which the soldiers made of the king's youthfulness and
                        irresolution caused great resentment, and they saw they were making no
                        headway. As, moreover, rumours were current that large reinforcements for
                        Caesar were on their way overland from Syria and Cilicia—intelligence which
                        had not yet come to Caesar's ears—they decided to intercept a convoy of
                        supplies which was being conveyed to our troops by sea. Accordingly they
                        stationed some lightly armed vessels on guard at suitable points near
                        Canopus, and lay in wait for our ships and supplies. When Caesar was
                        informed of this he ordered his entire fleet to be got ready and equipped,
                        putting Tiberius Nero <app n="1">
                            <note>1 The father of the Emperor Tiberius.</note>
                        </app> in command. Included in this fleet when it set out were the Rhodian
                        ships, and aboard them Euphranor, without whom no naval action had ever been
                        fought, and none even that was not a resounding victory. Fortune, however,
                        very often reserves for a harsher fate those upon whom she has showered her
                        most prolific blessings; and so too the fortune that now attended Euphranor
                        was different from that of former times. For when they reached </p>
                    <pb n="51"/>
                    <p> Canopus and each side had drawn up its fleet and entered the conflict,
                        Euphranor, following his normal custom, was the first to join battle but
                        when he had holed and sunk one enemy quadrireme, he pursued the next one too
                        far; and as the other ships were not quick enough in following his lead, he
                        was surrounded by the Alexandrians. No one brought him assistance, either
                        because they thought that, considering his courage and his good luck, he was
                        quite able to take care of himself, or because they were afraid for their
                        own sakes. And so the one and only man who was successful in that battle
                        perished alone along with his victorious quadrireme. <note type="margin"

                        the Alexandrian war to fetch reinforcements; and now, accompanied by large
                        forces which he had speedily raised, thanks both to the very helpful
                        attitude adopted by the states and to his own conscientious efforts, he
                        arrived at Pelusium by the overland route which links Egypt with Syria. This
                        town had been occupied by a strong garrison of Achillas on account of the

                        suddenly surrounded it with large forces and, despite the obstinate defence

                        against him, by which he believed Mithridates could either be beaten and
                        destroyed, or else undoubtedly held in check. However, desirous as he was
                        for his defeat, he was quite as content to cut him off from Caesar and hold
                        him in check. The first of his forces to succeed in crossing the river from
                        Delta and meeting Mithridates joined battle in eager haste to forestall
                        those following up behind, and so rob them of the chance to participate in
                        victory. Mithridates contained their attack with great discretion,
                        fortifying his camp after our regular fashion; but when he saw them coming
                        up to the entrenchments with a con- </p>

                        them. And had not the remainder employed their knowledge of the district to
                        find cover for themselves, and some retired to the ships in which they had
                        crossed the river, they would have been completely wiped out. When they had
                        recovered a little from the resulting panic, they joined forces with their
                        comrades following up behind, and proceeded to a new attack on Mithridates.
                            <note type="margin" n="28"/> A messenger was despatched by Mithridates
                        to Caesar to bring him tidings of the action. The king learned of these same
                        events from his own people. Accordingly at practically the same time the
                        king set forth to crush Mithridates, and Caesar to relieve him. The king had
                        recourse to the quicker method of transport, namely sailing up the river
                        Nile, in which he had a large fleet in readiness. Caesar was unwilling to
                        use the same route, so as not to fight a naval action in the river. Instead,
                        he sailed round by that sea which is said to belong to part of Africa, as I
                        have explained earlier.<app n="1">

                                Alexandria, and then marched S. E., keeping Lake Mareotis on his

                        latter could attack Mithridates, and so rescued the victorious Mithridates
                        with his army intact. The king had encamped with his forces in a naturally
                        strong position,<app n="2">
                            <note>2 There is wide disagreement about identifying this position but
                                assuming that Mithridates marched X.W. to join Caesar it seems
                                reasonable to place it close to the western<pb n="55"/> branch of
                                the Nile about half-way between Cairo and Alexandria, but perhaps

                        beneath it on all sides; moreover, on three sides it was covered by defences
                        of diverse types: one side abutted the river Nile; a second ran along very
                        high ground and formed one face of his camp; while the third was encircled
                        by a marsh. </p>
                    <pb n="57"/>
                    <p>
                        <note type="margin" n="29"/> Between the camp and Caesar's line of march ran
                        a narrow river with very high banks, which flowed into the Nile and was some
                        seven miles distant from the king's camp. When the king learned that Caesar
                        was coming by this route, he despatched all his cavalry and a picked force
                        of light-armed infantry to this river to prevent Caesar from crossing it and
                        to engage at long range from its banks—an unfair engagement, for the spot
                        could neither afford scope for valour nor involve cowardice in any risk.
                        These tactics filled our infantry and cavalry with burning resentment at the
                        thought that for so long their struggle with the Alexandrians should prove a
                        drawn battle. And so, at the same time as scattered groups of German
                        cavalry, looking for places to ford the river, swam across it at some points
                        where the banks were lower, simultaneously the legionary troops, having
                        felled lofty trees tall enough to reach from bank to bank, hurled them
                        forward and crossed the river on a causeway hastily thrown on top. So
                        terrified were the enemy by their attack, that they pinned their hopes of
                        deliverance to flight: in vain, however: for few survived that rout to take
                        refuge with the king, and practically all the remainder were killed. <note
                            type="margin" n="30"/> After this most notable success Caesar forthwith
                        pushed forward triumphantly to the king's camp, holding the view that his
                        sudden approach would strike great terror into the hearts of the
                        Alexandrians. But when he observed that this camp was strongly entrenched as
                        well as protected by its natural position, and saw the serried mass of armed
                        men posted at the rampart, he was unwilling to let his soldiers, weary as
                        they were with marching and </p>
                    <pb n="59"/>
                    <p> fighting, advance to attack the camp. Accordingly he pitched camp at no
                        great distance from the enemy. In a nearby hamlet, not far distant from the
                        king's camp, there was a fort which the king had built and linked with
                        bastions to the main defences of his camp so as to hold the hamlet. This
                        fort Caesar attacked and took by storm on the following day with all his
                        forces; not that he thought it would be difficult to gain that objective by
                        using a smaller number of soldiers, but in order that, with the Alexandrians
                        thoroughly unnerved as a result, he might go straight on from that victory
                        to attack the king's camp. And so, having chased the retreating Alexandrians
                        from the fort into their camp, our troops carried on their charge right up
                        to the fortifications, where they proceeded to fight at long range very
                        briskly. On two sides our men were afforded an opening for assault: the
                        first was the one which, as I have explained, allowed unimpeded approach;
                        the second comprised the moderate-sized space between the camp and the river
                        Nile. The largest and most carefully picked contingent of the Alexandrians
                        was defending that side which afforded the easiest approach; but the
                        defenders in the area of the river Nile were the most successful in
                        repelling and wounding our men:<app n="1">
                            <note>1 This interpretation assumes qui . . . propugnabant as the

                                defensive fighting seems to confirm it. The alternative— omitting
                                the comma after nostris—' they (the largest contingent of the
                                Alexandrians) were the most successful in . . . wounding our men who
                                were fighting in the area of the Nile.' seems hardly to agree with
                                the tactical situation.</note>

                        directions—from the rampart of the camp ahead of them, and from the river
                        behind them, where many ships manned with slingers and archers were engaging
                        our men. <note type="margin" n="31"/> Now Caesar saw that, while it was
                        impossible for his soldiers to fight with any greater gallantry, yet little
                        headway was being made on account of the difficulty of the ground; he also
                        noted that the </p>
                    <pb n="61"/>
                    <p> highest sector of their camp had been abandoned by the Alexandrians, not
                        only because of its natural strength, but also because, in their eagerness
                        in some cases to fight, in others to look on, its defenders had rushed down
                        to the sector where the fighting was going on consequently he ordered some
                        cohorts to proceed thither, skirting the camp, and storm the height, putting
                        in command of them Carfulenus, a man of exceptional personality and
                        experience in the field. When they arrived there our men fought with the
                        greatest gallantry against those few of the enemy who were defending the
                        entrenchment; whereupon the Alexandrians, panic-stricken by the shouting and
                        fighting on both sides of them, began to rush about in confusion hither and
                        thither throughout the camp. This utter bewilderment of theirs fired the
                        spirits of our troops to such a pitch that they captured the camp almost
                        simultaneously in all sectors, though its highest point was the first to
                        capitulate and from that point our men rushed down and killed a vast
                        multitude of the enemy in the camp. In their efforts to escape this danger
                        most of the Alexandrians hurled themselves en masse from the rampart into
                        the area adjoining the river; the first of these were crushed by their heavy
                        fall in the actual trench of the fortification, but the rest found it easier
                        to escape. It is established that the king himself fled from the camp and
                        then, after being taken aboard a ship along with a large number of his men
                        who were swimming to the nearest ships, perished when as a result of the
                        numbers the vessel capsized. <note type="margin" n="32"/> This signal
                        victory, the outcome of a most speedy and successful action, filled Caesar
                        with such confidence that he hastened with his cavalry to Alexan- </p>

                        quarter of the town which was held by the enemy garrison. Nor was he
                        mistaken in his own conclusion that, as soon as they heard of that battle,
                        the enemy would cease to think any longer in terms of war. On his arrival he
                        reaped the well-earned fruits of valour and magnanimity: for the entire
                        population of townsfolk threw down their arms, abandoned their
                        fortifications, assumed that garb in which suppliants are used to placate
                        tyrants with earnest prayers, and brought forth all the sacred emblems by
                        the sanctity of which they had been wont to conjure the embittered and
                        wrathful hearts of their kings: even so did they hasten to meet Caesar on
                        his arrival and surrendered themselves to him. Caesar took them formally
                        under his protection and consoled them then, passing through the enemy
                        fortifications, he came to his own quarter of the town amid loud cheers of
                        congratulation from his own troops, who rejoiced at the happy issue, not
                        only of the war itself and the fighting, but also of his arrival under such
                        circumstances. <note type="margin" n="33"/> Having made himself master of
                        Egypt and Alexandria, Caesar appointed as kings those whose names Ptolemaeus
                        had written down in his will with an earnest appeal to the Roman people that
                        they should not be altered. The elder of the two boys— the late king—being
                        now no more, Caesar assigned the kingdom to the younger one and to
                        Cleopatra, the elder of the two daughters, who had remained his loyal

                        rulers, who could enjoy neither the affection of their people, inasmuch as
                        they had remained throughout staunch friends of Caesar, nor the authority of
                        a long-established reign, it being but a few days since they came to the
                        throne. At the same time he deemed it conducive to the dignity of our empire
                        and to public expediency that, if the rulers remained loyal, they should be
                        protected by our troops: whereas if they proved ungrateful, those same
                        troops could hold them in check. Having thus completed all his dispositions,
                        he set out in person for Syria. <note type="margin" n="34"/> While these
                        events were taking place in Egypt, king Deiotarus came to Domitius Calvinus,
                        to whom Caesar had assigned the government of Asia and the neighbouring
                        provinces, to beg him not to allow Lesser Armenia, his own kingdom, or
                        Cappadocia, the kingdom of Ariobarzanes, to be occupied and over-run by
                        Pharnaces <app n="2">

                        out his instructions and pay out the money he had promised to Caesar. As
                        Domitius not only considered the money to be indispensable for defraying
                        military expenses, but also decided it was a shameful affront to the Roman
                        people and to the triumphant C. Caesar as well as a slight to himself that
                        the kingdoms of their allies and friends should be seized by a foreign king,
                        he forthwith sent a deputation to Pharnaces, bidding him withdraw from
                        Armenia and </p>

                        resorting to civil war. In the belief that this warning would have greater
                        force if he approached closer to that area with an army, he set out for his
                        legions; then. taking with him one of the three, the Thirty-Sixth, he sent
                        to Caesar in Egypt the two <app n="1">

                        not arrive in time for the Alexandrian war, as it was sent by the overland
                        route through Syria. Cn. Domitius reinforced the Thirty-Sixth legion with
                        two from Deiotarus, which the latter had had for several years, having built
                        them up on our system of discipline and armament; he also added to it 100
                        horsemen, and took a like number from Ariobarzanes. He sent P. Sestius to C.
                        Plaetorius. the quaestor, with instructions to bring the legion which had
                        been formed from the hastily improvised forces in Pontus and Quintus
                        Patisius to Cilicia to muster auxiliary troops. All these forces speedily
                        assembled at Comana <app n="2">
                            <note>2 A town in Pontus.</note>
                        </app> according to the orders of Domitius. <note type="margin" n="35"/>
                        Meantime the envoys brought back this reply from Pharnaces: ' he had
                        withdrawn from Cappadocia, but had recovered Lesser Armenia, which he ought
                        to possess by due right of inheritance from his father. In short, the issue
                        touching that kingdom should be kept open for Caesar's decision for he was
                        ready to do what Caesar should decide.' Now Cn. Domitius observed that he
                        had withdrawn from Cappadocia not from free choice but of necessity, since
                        he could defend Armenia next door to his own kingdom more easily than the
                        more distant Cappadocia, and also because he had supposed that Domitius
                        would bring up all three legions and that when he heard that </p>
                    <pb n="69"/>
                    <p> two of those legions had been sent to Caesar, this had heightened his rash
                        resolve to stay on in Armenia. Consequently Domitius proceeded to insist
                        that Pharnaces should withdraw from that kingdom also: ' as far as legal
                        right went, there was no difference between Cappadocia and Armenia, nor had
                        he any right to demand that the question should be left open pending
                        Caesar's arrival; a matter was ' open when it remained just as it had been.'
                        Having given him this reply Domitius set out for Armenia with the forces I
                        have recorded above, and began by marching along the higher ground. From
                        Comana in Pontus there is, in fact, a lofty, wooded ridge which extends into
                        Lesser Armenia and forms the boundary <app n="1">

                                followed the ridge between the rivers Lycus and Iris; and this would
                                have been his most direct route.<pb n="69"/> But he may have taken a

                        </app> between Cappadocia and Armenia. This route, as he saw, offered
                        definite advantages, namely that on the higher ground no sudden enemy attack
                        could develop, and that, as Cappadocia adjoined this ridge, it was likely to
                        assist him by affording an abundance of supplies. <note type="margin" n="36"
                        /> Meanwhile Pharnaces sent several embassies to Domitius to discuss peace
                        and to take princely gifts for Domitius. All these he firmly rejected and
                        replied to the envoys that as far as he was concerned nothing should take
                        precedence over the prestige of the Roman people and the recovery of the
                        kingdoms of its allies. Then, after completing an uninterrupted succession
                        of long marches, he began to approach Nicopolis, a town in Lesser Armenia
                        which is actually situated in the plain, though it is hemmed in on two sides
                        by high mountains at a fairish distance. Here he pitched camp roughly seven </p>
                    <pb n="71"/>
                    <p> miles from Nicopolis. Erom this camp he had to traverse a narrow and
                        confined defile: and for this reason Pharnaces arrayed the pick of his
                        infantry and practically all his cavalry in an ambush, giving orders,
                        moreover, that a large number of cattle should be pastured at various points
                        within this gorge, and that the peasants and burghers should go about openly
                        in that area. His object in so doing was that, if Domitius should pass
                        through that defile as a friend, he might have no suspicions of an ambush,
                        as he would observe both men and beasts moving about the countryside, as if
                        friends were in the offing; while if he should come in no friendly spirit,
                        treating it as enemy territory, his troops might become scattered in the
                        process of plundering and so be cut down piecemeal. <note type="margin"
                            n="37"/> While making these dispositions he still constantly continued
                        sending delegations to Domitius to talk of peace and friendship, as he
                        believed that by these self-same tactics Domitius could the more readily be
                        duped. But on the other hand Domitius' hopes of peace afforded him a motive
                        for tarrying in the camp, where he was. Consequently, as Pharnaces had now
                        lost his immediate opportunity and was afraid that his ambush might be
                        discovered, he recalled his troops to camp. On the morrow Domitius advanced
                        nearer Nicopolis and pitched his camp over against the town. While our
                        troops were fortifying it, Pharnaces drew up his line of battle according to
                        his own established custom. This, in fact, was formed with its front as a
                        single straight line, with each of the wings reinforced by three
                        supporting-lines and on the same principle support lines were also posted in
                        the centre, while in the two spaces, </p>
                    <pb n="73"/>
                    <p> on the right hand and the left, single ranks were drawn up. Having once
                        begun the task of fortifying his camp, Domitius completed it, with part of
                        his forces posted in front of the rampart. <note type="margin" n="38"/> The
                        following night Pharnaces intercepted some couriers who were carrying
                        despatches to Domitius concerning the situation at Alexandria. From them he
                        learned that Caesar was in a very dangerous position, and that an urgent
                        request was being made to Domitius that he should send Caesar reinforcements
                        as soon as possible and himself advance through Syria closer to Alexandria.
                        On learning this, Pharnaces saw himself virtually victorious if he could
                        spin out the time, as he thought that Domitius must speedily withdraw.
                        Accordingly, from that side of the town which he saw offered our men the
                        easiest and most favourable line of approach to do battle, he carried two
                        straight trenches, four feet deep and spaced not so very far apart, as far
                        as the point beyond which he had decided not to advance his own battle line.
                        Between these trenches he consistently drew up his line, while posting all
                        his cavalry on the flanks outside the trench for otherwise they could not be
                        of any use, and they far outnumbered our cavalry. <note type="margin" n="39"
                        /> Domitius, however, was more disturbed by Caesar's peril than by his own;
                        and as he thought that he would not be safe in withdrawing, if he made a
                        fresh attempt to secure the terms he had rejected or if he withdrew for no
                        good reason, he deployed his army from its nearby camp into battle
                        formation. He posted the Thirty-Sixth legion on the right wing and the
                        Pontic one on the left, while the legions of Deiotarus he concentrated in
                        the centre, leaving </p>
                    <pb n="75"/>
                    <p> them, however, a very narrow frontage and posting his remaining cohorts
                        behind them in support. The lines being thus arrayed on either side, they
                        proceeded to battle. <note type="margin" n="40"/> The signal to attack was
                        given almost simultaneously on both sides: then came the charge, with hotly
                        contested and fluctuating fighting. Thus the Thirty-Sixth legion launched an
                        attack on the king's cavalry outside the trench and fought so successful an
                        action that it advanced up to the walls of the town, crossed the trench, and
                        attacked the enemy in rear. The Pontic legion, however, on the other Hank,
                        drew back a little from the enemy, and attempted, moreover, to go round or
                        cross the trench, so as to attack the enemy's exposed flank but in the
                        actual crossing of the trench it was pinned down and overwhelmed.<app n="1">
                            <note>1 The text is corrupt and the manoeuvre is by no means clear; but
                                it would seem that part, if not all, the Pontie legion—like the
                                Thirty-Sixth—was posted outside the trench, and so, to attack the
                                enemy flank, they had either to cross the trench (its width is not
                                stated) or else retire far enough to work round its end.</note>
                        </app> The legions of Deiotarus, indeed, offered scarcely any resistance to
                        the attack. Consequently the king's forces, victorious on their own right
                        wing and in the centre of the line, now turned upon the Thirty-Sixth legion.
                        The latter, nevertheless, bore up bravely under the victors' attack and,
                        though surrounded by large enemy forces, yet with consummate presence of
                        mind formed a circle and so made a fighting withdrawal to the foothills,
                        where Pharnaces was loth to pursue it owing to the hilly nature of the
                        ground. And so, with the Pontic legion an almost total loss and a large
                        proportion of the troops of Deiotarus killed, the Thirty-Sixth legion
                        retired to higher ground with losses not exceeding 250 men. There fell in
                        that battle not a few Roman knights—brilliant and distinguished men. After
                        sustaining this defeat Domitius none the less collected the remnants of his

                        To this province there had been sent out in the summer a quaestor of
                        Caesar's, Q. Cornifieius, as pro-praetor <note n="marg">4f8 B.C.</note> and

                        very meagre prospects of the province—especially since it was the prize of
                        valour. Again, when in the course of his flight from the battle of Pharsalia
                        Octavius took refuge with a large fleet upon that coast, Cornificius. with
                        the aid of a few ships of the men of ladera—those devoted supporters of the
                        commonwealth, who were unsurpassed in their constant loyalty—made himself
                        master of Octavius' scattered ships, and was accordingly enabled by the
                        addition of these vessels to those of his allies to go into action with
                        something like a fleet. And when in quite a different quarter of the globe
                        Caesar was victoriously pursuing Cn. Pompeius, and heard that several of his
                        opponents had collected the remnants of the fugitives and taken refuge in

                        leadership and initiative— anyway he derived no support from the resources
                        of the province, bled white as it partly was, and partly disloyal, nor could
                        supplies be conveyed to him by ship, since stormy weather had interrupted
                        navigation. As a result of these considerable difficulties he was forced to
                        conduct the campaign, not as he wished, but as necessity dictated. And so,
                        as lack of supplies forced him to storm towns or strongholds in very adverse
                        weather, he frequently sustained reverses, and was held by the natives in
                        such contempt that, while retreating on Salona, a coastal town occupied by
                        very gallant and loyal Roman citizens, he was forced to fight an action on
                        the march. In this battle <note n="marg">Jan. 47.</note>. he lost more than
                        two thousand soldiers, thirty-eight centurions and four tribunes: with what
                        was left of his forces he retired to Salona, where, under the stress of
                        overwhelming difficulties of every kind, he fell sick and died within a few
                        months. His chequered fortune while alive and his sudden death inspired
                        Octavius with high hopes of securing possession of the province luck,
                        however, which is a very potent factor in war, as well as the carefulness of
                        Cornificius and the courage of Vatinius, did not allow Octavius to pursue
                        his successful career much longer. <note type="margin" n="44"/> When
                        Vatinius was at Brundisium he learned of what had been going on in
                        Illyricum; moreover, frequent despatches from Cornificius kept summoning him
                        to bring aid to the province, and he heard that M. Octavius had concluded
                        treaties with the natives and in several places was attacking the garrisons
                        of our troops, in some cases in person with his fleet, in others with land
                        forces, employing </p>
                    <pb n="83"/>
                    <p> native troops. So, although he was afflicted by a serious illness and his
                        bodily strength barely enabled him to obey his will, yet by courage he
                        overcame his physical handicap, as well as the difficulties both of winter
                        and the sudden mobilisation. Thus, as he himself had few warships in
                        harbour, he sent despatches to Q. Calenus in Achaia, requesting him to send
                        him a fleet but as this proved too slow a business—our troops were in no
                        position to withstand Octavius' attack, and their critical situation
                        urgently demanded something speedier—he fitted beaks to some fast boats, of
                        which he had a sufficient number, though their size was by no means adequate
                        for fighting purposes. With these added to his warships, and his fleet
                        thereby numerically increased, he put on board some veteran troops, of which
                        he had an abundant supply from all the legions—they had been on the sick
                        list and had been left behind at Brundisium when the army was being shipped
                        to Greece—and so set out for Illyricum. Now there were not a few coastal
                        communities there which had revolted and surrendered to Octavius: some of
                        these he recovered, others he by-passed when they remained steadfast to
                        their policy; nor would he allow anything, however pressing, to embarrass or
                        delay him from pursuing Octavius himself with all the speed of which he was
                        capable. While the latter was assaulting Epidaurus by land and sea, where
                        there was a garrison of ours, Vatinius forced him by his approach to abandon
                        his assault, and so relieved our garrison. <note type="margin" n="45"/> When
                        Octavius learned that Vatinius had a fleet which was in the main made up of
                        small, fast boats, having full confidence in his own fleet he hove to off
                        the island of Tauris. In this area Vatinius was <note n="marg">March

                    <p> cruising in pursuit, not from any knowledge that Octavius had hove to there,
                        but because the latter had gained a fairly good start, and he had resolved
                        to pursue him. On approaching closer to Tauris with his ships strung out,
                        since the weather was rough and he had no suspicion of the enemy, he
                        suddenly observed a ship bearing down upon him, its yard-arms lowered to
                        mid-mast, and manned with combat troops. When he saw this, he promptly
                        ordered the sails to be reefed, the yardarms lowered, and the troops to
                        stand to; and then, by hoisting the pennant, which was his method of giving
                        the signal for action, he signalled the leading ships astern of him to do
                        the same. The Vatinians being thus suddenly taken unawares proceeded to man
                        ship: the Octavians, their ships already manned, came sailing out of the
                        harbour one after another. Line of battle was formed on either side, that of
                        Octavius being superior in formation, that of Vatinius in the morale of the
                        troops. <note type="margin" n="46"/>When Vatinius observed that neither in
                        the size nor the number of his ships was he. a match for a chance
                        engagement, he chose rather to trust to luck. And so he attacked first,
                        charging with his own quinquereme the quadrireme which was the flagship of
                        Octavius. The latter rowed forward against him with the utmost speed and
                        bravery, and the two ships ran together with their beaks head-on so
                        violently that Octavius' ship had its beak smashed away and was locked to
                        the other by its timbers. Elsewhere a fierce engagement took place, with
                        particularly sharp fighting near the leaders; for with each individual
                        captain trying to support his own leader, a great battle developed at close </p>
                    <pb n="87"/>
                    <p> range in the narrow sea. The more closely interlocked the ships—whenever the
                        opportunity was afforded for such fighting—the more marked was the
                        superiority of the Vatinians; for they displayed admirable courage in
                        leaping without hesitation from their own ships on to those of the enemy,
                        and where the fighting was on equal terms their markedly superior courage
                        brought them success. Octavius' own quadrireme was sunk, and many besides
                        were either captured or else rammed, holed and sunk: some of his combat
                        troops were cut down on the ships, others dived overboard. Octavius himself
                        took refuge in a pinnace; and when too many others sought safety in it and
                        it capsized, wounded as he was he swam to his own light galley. There he was
                        taken safely aboard and, when night put an end to the action, took to
                        flight, sailing in a stiff squall. He was followed by not a few of his own
                        ships, which chance had delivered from that hazard. <note type="margin"
                            n="47"/> Vatinius, on the other hand, rounded off this success by
                        sounding the retreat and withdrew triumphantly with his entire force intact
                        to the harbour from which Octavius' fleet had advanced to do battle. As a
                        result of that action he captured one quinquereme, two triremes, eight
                        two-banked galleys and a large number of Octavius' rowers. The next day he
                        spent there in refitting his own and the captured vessels; and on the day
                        following he hastened to the island of Issa, in the belief that Octavius had
                        taken refuge there in the course of his flight. In it there was a town—the
                        best known one in those parts, and one which was on the most friendly terms
                        with Octavius. On the arrival of Vatinius there the townsfolk threw
                        themselves upon </p>
                    <pb n="89"/>
                    <p> his mercy, and he learned that Octavius himself with a few small vessels had
                        set course with a following wind in the direction of Greece, intending to
                        make for Sicily next and then Africa. Thus in a short space of time Vatinius
                        had achieved a most notable success, recovering the province and restoring
                        it to Cornificius, and driving his opponents' fleet away from the whole of
                        that coast. Whereupon he withdrew in triumph to Brundisium with his army and
                        fleet unharmed. <note type="margin" n="48"/> Now during the period when
                        Caesar was besieging Pompeius at Dyrrachium, and achieving success at Old

                        risk, though rumour made it out to be still greater, Q. Cassius Longinus had
                        been left behind in Spain as propraetor to govern the further province.<app

                        in a position to observe equally from his own intuition—believing as he did
                        that the province reciprocated his own sentiments—and from the manifold
                        signs and indications afforded by those who found difficulty in concealing
                        their feelings of hate and now he was anxious to offset the dislike felt by
                        the province with the affection of his army. Consequently, as soon as he had
                        mustered the army all together, he promised the soldiers one hundred
                        sesterces apiece and not long afterwards in Lusitania, after successfully
                        storming the town of Medobrega and then Mount Herminius, on which the

                        he granted many large rewards to individuals; and though these gifts
                        inspired in the army a semblance of affection for the moment, yet they
                        gradually and insidiously undermined strict military discipline. <note

                        it. And so. as the habit of bribery necessitates, open-handedness was the
                        plausible excuse for seeking yet further contributions to the source of
                        bribery. Wealthy men were ordered to furnish sums of money, and these

                        similar plans for his assassination. Their hatred was intensified by some of

                        thousand and equipped at the greatest expense. No respite was given to the

                        and a highly fertile kingdom. And so he set out in person for Lusitania to
                        summon the legions and fetch auxiliaries, allotting certain men the task of
                        organising in advance supplies of corn and 100 ships, as well as assessing
                        and levying contributions of money, so as to avoid any delay on his return.
                        His return proved more expeditious than anyone expected: for there was no
                        lack of energy or vigilance in Cassius, especially when he coveted
                        something. <note type="margin" n="52"/> He then assembled his army at a
                        single rendezvous and pitched camp near Corduba. There at a parade he
                        explained to his troops the scheme it was his duty to carry out on Caesar's
                        instructions, and promised to give them 100 sesterces apiece when lie had
                        crossed over into Mauretania. The Fifth legion, he explained, would be in
                        Spain. Then, after the </p>

                        the judgment hall, a certain Minucius Silo, who was a client of L. Racilius
                        and was dressed as a soldier, handed him a note, as if he had some petition
                        to make of him; then, following behind Racilius—who was walking beside
                        Cassius—as though he were waiting for an answer, he quickly wormed his way
                        in between them when the chance offered, seized Longinus from behind with
                        his left hand and with his right stabbed him twice with a dagger. No sooner
                        was the alarm raised than all the conspirators joined in the attack.

                            type="margin" n="54"/> Meanwhile the tidings reached Laterensis that
                        Cassius was alive. Not so much disconcerted as grievously disappointed by
                        these tidings, he quickly recovered himself and set out to visit Cassius. On
                        learning of the facts the Thirtieth legion advanced to Corduba to bring aid
                        to their commander-in-chief: the Twenty-First did likewise; and the Fifth
                        followed their lead. Now that there were but two remaining legions in camp,
                        the men of the Second were afraid that they might be the only ones left
                        behind, and that the nature of their sentiments might be inferred from this
                        circumstance: consequently they followed the example of the previous
                        legions. The native legion remained steadfast in its attitude, and nothing
                        could intimidate it or make it budge. <note type="margin" n="55"/> Cassius
                        ordered the arrest of those who had been named as privy to the murderous
                        plot and, retaining five cohorts of the Thirtieth legion, sent the rest back
                        to camp. From the evidence of Minucius he </p>
                    <pb n="99"/>
                    <p> learned that L. Racilius and L. Laterensis and Annius Scapula—the last a
                        provincial of the highest standing and influence, with whom he was on as
                        intimate a footing as with Racilius and Laterensis— had all been involved in
                        that same conspiracy and it was not long before he gave expression to his
                        indignation by ordering their execution. Minucius he handed over to his
                        freedmen for torture: likewise Calpurnius Salvianus, who made a formal
                        deposition in which he named a larger number of conspirators— truthfully,
                        according to the belief of certain people under duress, as some complain.
                        Similar torture was applied to L. Mercello: . . . Squillus mentioned more
                        names. Cassius ordered their execution, except for those who bought
                        themselves off. For example, he openly made a bargain in fact with
                        Calpurnius for sixty thousand sesterces,<app n="1">
                            <note>1 Approximately equivalent to £530 in pre-war sterling. The

                        earned them a corresponding fine, yet the fact that the peril of death and
                        the pain of torture was remitted for cash showed how in Cassius cruelty had
                        vied with greed. <note type="margin" n="56"/> Several days later he received
                        despatches sent by Caesar, from which he learned that Pompeius had been
                        beaten in the field, lost his forces, and fled. This intelligence inspired
                        in him mixed feelings—of disappointment and pleasure: the news of victory
                        could not but make him happy: the completion of the war put an end to the
                        present licence. Consequently he could not make up his mind whether he would
                        rather have nothing to fear or nothing barred. When his wounds were healed
                        he summoned all those who had booked sums of money as debited to his account
                        and ordered the said sums to be entered </p>
                    <pb n="101"/>
                    <p> up as repaid<app n="1">

                                49, and the meaning seems to be that the outstanding debts were
                                written off in the ledgers as repaid, though in fact Longinus kept
                                the money. But as the two terms expensas and acct acceptas denote
                                the opposite sides of the ledger, the meaning might conceivably be
                                that the outstanding debts were not merely cancelled, but reversed;
                                and that the sums were to be entered up afresh as borrowed from
                                (acceptas), not lent to (expensas), Longinus. He would thus receive
                                them twice over. The following clause perhaps favours this latter

                        the man to pay a greater sum. Moreover, he held a levy of Roman knights.

                        overseas, he invited them to purchase their discharge. This proved a great
                        source of profit, but the hatred it produced was still greater. This done,
                        he reviewed his entire army and then despatched to the point of embarkation
                        the legions he intended to take into Africa, with their auxiliary troops. He
                        himself proceeded to Hispalis to inspect the fleet he was building up and
                        there he tarried awhile, since he had published a decree throughout the
                        province that those who had been ordered to contribute, but had not yet
                        contributed sums of money, must come before him. This summons disturbed them
                        all profoundly. <note type="margin" n="57"/> Meanwhile L. Titius brought
                        tidings of the native legion, in which he had been at the time a military
                        tribune: his report ran that while it was encamped near the town of Ilipa a
                        mutiny had broken out, and several centurions who had refused to let them
                        strike camp had been killed the legion had then parted company with the
                        Thirtieth legion—this was also under command of Q. Cassius, the governor's
                        deputy—and made haste to join the Second legion, which was being taken to
                        the straits by another route. On learning of the matter Longinus left by
                        night with five cohorts of the Twenty-First legion, and early in the morning

                        then he marched to Carmo. Here he was joined by the Thirtieth legion and the
                        Twenty-First, with four cohorts of the Fifth and his entire cavalry force,
                        and then heard that four cohorts had been overpowered by the native troops,
                        and in company with the latter had made contact with the second legion near
                        Obucula,1 where they had all joined forces and chosen T. Thorius, a native
                        of Italica, as their leader. He promptly held a consultation and despatched
                        the quaestor, M. Marcellus, to Covduba, to retain control of it, and Q.
                        Cassius, his deputy, to Hispalis. Within a few days news was brought to him
                        that the corporation of Corduba had revolted from him, and that Marcellus,
                        either of his own free will, or under compulsion— reports varied on this
                        point—was hand in glove with the men of Corduba and that the two cohorts of
                        the Fifth legion which had formed the garrison force of Corduba were taking
                        a similar line. Incensed by these reports Cassius struck camp, and on the
                        morrow came to Segovia <app n="1">
                            <note>1 Its exact location is unknown: see Index.</note>

                        of his troops, learning thereby that it was not for his own sake, but for
                        the sake of the absent Caesar that they were entirely loyal to himself, and
                        that there was no hazard they would not face without a murmur, so be they
                        were the means of restoring the province to Caesar. <note type="margin"
                            n="58"/> Meanwhile Thorius led his veteran legions towards Corduba. To
                        avoid the impression that the quarrel had originally arisen from any natural
                        tendency to mutiny on his own part or on that of his troops, and at the same
                        time to counter Q. Cassius—who, as </p>
                    <pb n="105"/>
                    <p> it appeared, was operating in the name of Caesar with forces more powerful
                        than his own—with no less weighty an authority, he kept openly asserting
                        that it was for Cn. Pompeius that he wished to recover the province. And it
                        may even be that he did so wish, owing to his hatred for Caesar and
                        affection for Pompey, the hitter's name carrying great weight with those
                        legions which M. Varro had held.<app n="1">

                        </app> But what his motive was in this was a matter for general conjecture.
                        At any rate that was what Thorius gave out; and his troops acknowledged it
                        to the extent that they had the name of Cn. Pompeius carved on their
                        shields. A vast concourse of citizens came forth to meet the legions, not
                        only of men but also of matrons and youths, beseeching them not to approach
                        Corduba as enemies and plunder it: they themselves in fact shared in the
                        universal antagonism against Cassius and they prayed they might not be
                        compelled to act against Caesar. <note type="margin" n="59"/> The tears and
                        entreaties of this vast multitude had no little effect upon the army; it saw
                        too that to punish Cassius it had no need of the name and memory of Cn.
                        Pompeius that Longinus was equally hateful to all the adherents of Caesar as
                        he was to those of Pompey; and that it could induce neither the citizen
                        corporation of Corduba nor Marcellus to act contrary to Caesar's interest.
                        Accordingly they removed Pompey's name from their shields, adopted
                        Marcellus, who professed his intention to champion Caesar's cause, as their
                        leader and hailed him as praetor, made common cause with the citizen
                        corporation, and pitched their camp near Corduba. Within two days Cassius
                        pitched camp on his side of the river Baetis some four miles distant from
                        Corduba, </p>
                    <pb n="107"/>
                    <p> in a lofty position in sight of the town. He sent despatches to king Bogud
                        in Mauretania and to M. Lepidus, the pro-consul, in Hither Spain, urging
                        each to come as soon as possible to the aid of himself and the province, in
                        the interest of Caesar. He himself laid waste in hostile fashion the
                        territory of Corduba and set buildings ablaze. <note type="margin" n="60"/>
                        The hideous and outrageous character of this action led the legions which
                        had taken Marcellus for their leader to rush to him in a body and beg him
                        that they might be led out to battle and granted an opportunity of engaging
                        the enemy before those most illustrious and beloved possessions of the
                        people of Corduba should suffer the grievous ignominy of being consumed
                        before their very eyes by plunder, fire and sword. Though Marcellus thought
                        it a thousand pities to engage, since the loss sustained by victor and
                        vanquished alike would in either case have repercussions on Caesar, and it
                        lay outside his power to control it, yet he took his legions across the
                        Baetis and drew up his line. On seeing that Cassius had drawn up his line
                        facing him on higher ground in front of his own camp. Marcellus prevailed
                        upon his troops to withdraw to their camp, putting them off with the excuse
                        that the enemy refused to come down into the plain. And so he proceeded to
                        withdraw his forces. Cassius employed his excellent cavalry— in which arm he
                        was strong, and knew Marcellus to be weak—to attack the retreating
                        legionaries, and killed quite a number of their rearguard on the banks of
                        the river. Made aware by this loss of the drawback and difficulty involved
                        in crossing the river. Marcellus transferred his camp to the other side of
                        the Baetis. Now both commanders frequently led </p>
                    <pb n="109"/>
                    <p> out their legions to battle; there was, however, no engagement owing to the
                        difficult nature of the ground. <note type="margin" n="61"/> Marcellus was
                        much stronger in infantry forces; for the legions he had were veteran ones,
                        tested in many campaigns. Cassius relied on the loyalty rather than the
                        valour of his legions. Consequently when the two camps had been pitched over
                        against one another and Marcellus had selected a position suitable for a
                        stronghold which might enable him to prevent the enemy troops from getting
                        water, Longinus was afraid of being shut up by a virtual blockade in
                        territory controlled by others and hostile to himself; and so he silently
                        set out from his camp by night and marched swiftly to Ulia, a town which he
                        believed to be loyal to himself. There he pitched his camp so close to the
                        walls of the town that not only its natural position—for Ulia is situated on
                        a lofty mountain—but also the actual fortification of the city made him safe
                        on all sides from assault. Marcellus pursued him and pitched his camp over
                        against the enemy camp as close to Ulia as he could. When he had appreciated
                        the nature of the ground, he had inevitably to resort to the very tactics to
                        which above all he wanted to resort, namely refraining from an
                        engagement—and had there been an opportunity for engaging he could not have
                        held in check his excited troops—and at the same time not allowing Cassius
                        to roam too far afield, to prevent more communities from suffering the fate
                        of the inhabitants of Corduba. By siting strongholds at suitable points and
                        carrying his field-works in a continuous ring round the town, he hemmed in
                        Ulia and Cassius with entrenchments. But before these </p>
                    <pb n="111"/>
                    <p> could be completed, Longinus sent out his entire cavalry force, in the
                        belief that it would stand him in very good stead if it stopped Marcellus
                        from collecting fodder and corn, whereas it would prove a great handicap if,
                        shut up by blockade and rendered useless, it used up precious corn. <note

                        Cassius' despatches, arrived with his forces he had brought one legion with
                        him, and to this he now added several auxiliary cohorts of Spanish troops.
                        For, as usually happens in civil wars, some states in Spain at that time
                        were supporters of Cassius, though a larger number warmly espoused the cause
                        of Marcellus. Bogud and his forces came up to the outer entrenchments of
                        Marcellus: sharp fighting-broke out between the two sides, and this recurred
                        at frequent intervals, with the tide of fortune often turning from one side
                        to the other. Marcellus, however, was never dislodged from his field-works.
                            <note type="margin" n="63"/> Meanwhile Lepidus came to Ulia from the
                        nearer province with thirty-five legionary cohorts and a large number of
                        cavalry and other auxiliary troops, his object being to resolve, quite
                        impartially, the dispute between Cassius and Marcellus. On his arrival
                        Marcellus without hesitation put himself confidently into Lepidus' hands.
                        Cassius, on the other hand, remained within his own defences, either because
                        he thought that a greater measure of justice was due to himself than to
                        Marcellus, or else because he was afraid that Lepidus' attitude might have
                        been biased by the deference shewn him by his opponent. Lepidus pitched his
                        camp near Ulia, in complete accord with Marcellus. He refused to allow any
                        fighting, invited Cassius to come out, and pledged </p>
                    <pb n="113"/>
                    <p> his word to every offer he made. For a long time Cassius was in doubt as to
                        what he should do or what confidence he should place in Lepidus; but as he
                        could find no solution to his policy if he remained steadfast in his
                        decision, he demanded that the entrenchments should be demolished and that
                        he himself should be granted leave to depart unmolested. Not only had a
                        truce been made, but by now a peaceful settlement had been all but arranged,
                        and they were dismantling the fieldworks and the sentries manning the
                        entrenchments had been withdrawn, when, though nobody expected it—if indeed
                        nobody included Cassius, for there was some doubt as to his complicity—the
                        king's auxiliary forces launched an attack upon the stronghold of Marcellus
                        nearest the king's camp, and overpowered a number of troops in it. And had
                        not Lepidus in righteous anger promptly lent his assistance to break up that
                        fray, a greater disaster would have been sustained. <note type="margin"
                            n="64"/> Now that the way lay open to Cassius, Marcellus joined his camp
                        to that of Lepidus. Lepidus and Marcellus then set out with their forces
                        simultaneously for Corduba, Cassius for Carmo. Round about the same time
                        Trebonius came to govern the <note n="marg">Feb. 47.</note> province as
                        pro-consul. When Cassius learned of his coming he posted the legions under
                        his command and the cavalry to their various winter-quarters; as for
                        himself, he hurriedly grabbed all his belongings and hastened to Malaca,
                        where he embarked, although the season was unfavourable for navigation. His
                        object, as lie personally averred, was to avoid committing himself to
                        Lepidus, Trebonius and Marcellus: as his friends asserted, to avoid the
                        relative humiliation of travelling through a province </p>
                    <pb n="115"/>
                    <p> a great part of which had revolted from him: as everyone else believed, to
                        avoid letting that money of his—the proceeds of innumerable robberies—fall
                        into the hands of anyone else. At first he made some headway in weather
                        which, considering it was winter, was favourable but after he had taken
                        shelter in the river Ebro to avoid sailing by night, the weather then became
                        somewhat stormier; believing, however, that he would run no greater risk if
                        he sailed, he set forth: but what with the swell rolling in head on against
                        the river mouth, and the strong current preventing him from putting about
                        just as the huge waves made it impossible to hold on straight ahead, his
                        ship sank in the very mouth of the river, and so he perished. <note

                        dangerous rifts, and the flattering indulgence shewn to their troops by the
                        military tribunes and legionary commanders was giving rise to many practices
                        opposed to military custom and usage which tended to undermine strict
                        discipline. All this, as he saw, urgently demanded his presence: yet, for
                        all that, he thought it more important to leave all the provinces and
                        districts he visited organised in such a way that they would be immune from
                        internal disagreements, would accept a legal constitution, and lay aside
                        their fears of aggression from without. This he was </p>

                        provinces had no war afflicting them: in Bithynia and Pontus he had, as he
                        saw, a heavier task impending. For he heard that Pharnaces had not evacuated
                        Pontus, and he did not expect him to do so, exceedingly puffed up as he was
                        by the successful battle he had fought against Domitius Calvinus. He spent
                        some time in practically all the more important states of Syria, bestowing
                        rewards both upon individuals and communities where they deserved them, and
                        holding official inquiries and giving his ruling in questions of
                        long-standing dispute: while as for the kings, sovereigns and rulers who, as
                        neighbours of the province, had one and all flocked to him, he formally took
                        them under his protection and then, on condition that they undertook to
                        watch over and guard the province, he dismissed them as very loyal friends
                        both to himself and the Roman people. <note type="margin" n="66"/> After
                        spending a few days in that province he posted Sextus Caesar, his friend and

                        summoned all the states of this latter province to forgather at
                        Tarsus—perhaps the most famous and strongest township in the whole of
                        Cilicia. There he settled all the affairs of the province and its
                        neighbouring states; but when he had done so, his eagerness to set out and
                        prosecute the war admitted no further delay; and so, after traversing
                        Cappadocia by forced marches and staying two days at Mazaca, he reached
                        Comana, where is the shrine of Bellona—the most ancient and holiest in

                        sought it by right of inheritance; for he was sprung from the royal
                        Cappadocian house, his claim in this respect being, in point of legal right,
                        by no means in doubt, though, in long passing of time, because of the
                        chequered fortunes of his ancestors and changes in the royal line of
                        descent, continuity had been broken. As for Ariobarzanes and his brother
                        Ariarathes, both of them had deserved well of the Republic; and so, to
                        prevent Ariarathes from being tempted to claim his inheritance to the
                        kingdom, or, as heir to it, from intimidating Ariobarzanes, Caesar granted
                        him part of Lesser Armenia and allowed Ariobarzanes to treat him as his
                        vassal. Whereupon Caesar himself proceeded to complete the remainder of his

                        Whereupon envoys sent by Pharnaces approached Caesar and first and foremost
                        entreated him not to approach their country in any hostile spirit, since
                        Pharnaces would carry out all his instructions. In particular they reminded

                        troops for use against Caesar; whereas Deiotarus, who had provided them, had
                        none the less given him satisfaction. <note type="margin" n="70"/> Caesar
                        replied that he would be scrupulously fair to Pharnaces if the latter
                        intended to carry out. his promises. He warned the envoys,however,in his

                        granting pardon when it was humbly entreated, yet it was impossible for him
                        to condone public outrages against the provinces in the ease of those who
                        had been loyal towards himself. ' In point of fact.' he went on, ' that very

                        death—-that Roman citizens have undergone. Pharnaces, however, must withdraw
                        forthwith from Pontus, release the household slaves of the tax-gatherers,
                        and make all other such restitution as lies in his power to the allies and
                        Roman citizens. If he does this, then—and not before—shall he send me the
                        tributes and gifts which triumphant commanders are in the habit of receiving
                        from their friends.' (Pharnaces had, in fact, sent him a golden crown.) Such
                        was the reply with which the envoys were sent back. <note type="margin"
                            n="71"/> All this Pharnaces graciously promised to do. However, as he
                        hoped that Caesar's impetuous haste would lead him to trust his own
                        assurances still more readily than the circumstances justified, so that he
                        might tackle more urgent matters with the greater expedition and
                        propriety—for everyone was aware that there were many reasons demanding
                        Caesar's return to Rome—in this hope, then, he began to take a more
                        leisurely line, to demand a later date for his withdrawal,to propose
                        agreements by way of causing delay —in fine,he proceeded to cheat. Realising
                        the fellow's cunning, Caesar was now of necessity constrained to adopt the
                        very tactics which on other occasions it had been his natural habit to
                        employ—namely to come to grips more promptly than anyone expected. <note

                        enjoys no little fame in those parts thanks to the victory of Mithridates,

                        the enemy and as he now saw that that valley by which the king's camp was
                        protected would, if its width separated them, equally afford protection to a
                        camp of his own, provided only that the enemy did not anticipate him in
                        capturing the ground in question, which was much nearer the king's camp, he
                        ordered materials for a rampart to be carted within the entrenchments. This
                        was speedily collected. The following night he left camp at the fourth watch

                                most likely. Caesar had some four miles to march; and if he left
                                camp early in the fourth watch (this would be quite short in June),
                                he could have taken the position at dawn. Two other interpretations

                                already encamped. The site seems to have been dominated by—though

                        none of his troops should quit their work of fortification, since the
                        intervening valley which separated the enemy's camp from the emplacements
                        which Caesar had begun was not more than a mile wide. <note type="margin"
                            n="74"/> On suddenly observing this situation at dawn, Pharnaces drew up
                        all his forces in front of his camp. In view of the highly uneven character
                        of the intervening ground Caesar supposed that it was the king's normal
                        military practice more than anything that occasioned this deployment; or
                        else his object was to delay Caesar's own work of fortification, through the
                        necessity of keeping more men standing to arms or again it might be intended
                        as a display of confidence on the king's part, to shew that it was not on
                        fortification so much as on armed force that Pharnaces relied to defend his
                        position. Accordingly, Caesar was not deterred from keeping the remainder of
                        his army engaged on the work of fortification, deploying only the front line
                        in front of the palisade. Pharnaces, however, took it into his head to
                        engage. Whether it was the lucky associations of the spot that drove him to
                        take this course, or whether it was his scrupulous observance of omens, to
                        which, as we afterwards heard, he gave careful heed, that so prompted him;
                        or maybe it was the small number of our troops which, according to his
                        information, were standing to arms (for he had supposed that that vast gang
                        of slaves which transported the material for the rampart, as though it was
                        their daily employment, was in fact composed of troops); or maybe even it
                        was his confidence in that veteran army of his, which, as his envoys
                        boasted, had fought and </p>
                    <pb n="131"/>
                    <p> conquered upon two and twenty battle-fields, coupled with a contempt for our
                        army, which he knew had been routed by himself when Domitius led it: anyway,
                        having decided to engage, he began the descent down the steep ravine. For
                        some little time Caesar laughed contemptuously at this empty bravado on the
                        part of the king, and at his troops packed closely on ground which no enemy
                        in his senses would be likely to set foot on; while in the meantime
                        Pharnaces with his forces in battle array proceeded to climb the steep
                        hill-side confronting him at the same steady pace at which he had descended
                        the sheer ravine. <note type="margin" n="75"/> This incredible foolhardiness
                        or confidence on the part of the king disconcerted Caesar, who was not
                        expecting it and was caught unprepared. Simultaneously he recalled the
                        troops from their work of fortification, ordered them to stand to arms,
                        deployed his legions to meet the attack, and formed line of battle; and the
                        sudden excitement to which all this gave rise occasioned considerable panic
                        among our troops. Disorganised as our men were, and as yet in no regular
                        formation, the king's chariots armed with scythes threw them into confusion;
                        but these chariots were speedily overwhelmed by a mass of missiles. In their
                        wake came the enemy line: the battle cry was raised and the conflict joined,
                        our men being greatly helped by the nature of the ground but above all by
                        the blessing of the immortal gods. For just as the gods play a part in all
                        the chance vicissitudes of war, so above all do they do so in those where
                        human strategy has proved quite powerless to avail. <note type="margin"
                            n="76"/> Heavy and bitter hand-to-hand fighting took place and it was on
                        the right wing, where the veteran Sixth </p>
                    <pb n="133"/>
                    <p> legion was posted that the first seeds of victory were sown. As the enemy
                        were being thrust back down the slope on this wing, so too on the left wing
                        and in the centre—much more slowly, but thanks nevertheless to the same
                        divine assistance—the entire forces of the king were being crushed. The ease
                        with which they had climbed the uneven ground was now matched by the speed
                        with which, once dislodged from their footing, the unevenness of the ground
                        enabled them to be driven back. Consequently, after sustaining many
                        casualties—some killed, some knocked out by their comrades' falling on top
                        of them—those whose nimbleness did enable them to escape none the less threw
                        away their arms and so, after crossing the valley, they could not make any
                        effective stand from the higher ground, unarmed as they now were. Our men,
                        on the contrary, elated by their victory, did not hesitate to climb the
                        uneven ground and storm the entrenchments. Moreover, despite the resistance
                        of those enemy cohorts which Pharnaces had left to guard his camp, they
                        promptly won possession of it. With his entire forces either killed or
                        captured Pharnaces took to flight with a few horsemen and had not our
                        storming of his camp afforded him a freer opportunity for flight, he would
                        have been brought alive into Caesar's hands. <note type="margin" n="77"/>
                        Such a victory transported Caesar—for all the many past victories to his
                        credit—with incredible delight, inasmuch as he had brought a very serious
                        war to so speedy a conclusion, and because an easy victory, which delighted
                        him the more when he recalled the sudden risk it had involved, had
                        transpired out of a very difficult situation. Having thus </p>
                    <pb n="135"/>
                    <p> recovered Pontus and made a present to his troops of all the royal plunder,
                        he himself set out on the following day with his cavalry in light order;
                        instructing the Sixth legion to leave for Italy to receive its rewards and
                        honours, sending home the auxiliary troops of Deiotarus, and leaving two
                        legions in Pontus with Caelius Vinicianus. <note type="margin" n="78"/> Thus
                        he marched through Gallograecia and Bithynia into Asia, holding
                        investigations and giving his formal ruling on matters of dispute in all
                        those provinces, and assigning due prerogatives to tetrarchs, kings and
                        states. Now Mithridates of Pergamum, whose speedy and successful action in
                        Egypt I have described above, was not merely of royal birth but also of
                        royal training and upbringing; for Mithridates, king of all Asia, had
                        carried him off to cam]) with him from Pergamum on the score of his noble
                        birth when he was quite young, and had kept him there for many years; for
                        which reasons Caesar now appointed him king of Bosphorus, which had formerly
                        been under control of Pharnaces, and, by thus creating a buffer state ruled
                        by a most friendly king, he secured the provinces of the Roman people from
                        barbarian and unfriendly kings. To the same Mithridates he awarded, by right
                        of racial affinity and kinship, the tetrarchy of Gallograecia which had been
                        seized and occupied a few years earlier by Deiotarus.<app n="1">

                        </app> Nowhere, however, did he delay any longer than the urgency of
                        unsettled conditions at Rome appeared to warrant; and when he had
                        accomplished his tasks with the greatest success and expedition, he arrived
                        in Italy more quickly than anyone expected. </p>

                        cavalry also joined the muster. <note type="margin" n="2"/> Six legions and
                        two thousand cavalry had now been mustered. Each legion, as soon as it
                        arrived, was embarked on the warships, while the cavalry were shipped aboard
                        the transports. Accordingly, he ordered the greater part of the fleet to
                        sail on ahead and make for the island of Aponiana, which is ten miles
                        distant from Lilybaeum: he himself stayed behind there for a few days and
                        sold up the property of a few persons for the profit of the state, and then
                        gave full instructions to the praetor Alienus, who was governor of Sieily,
                        in particular about the prompt embarkation of the rest of the army. Having
                        given these instructions, he himself embarked on Deeember 25 and immediately
                        caught up with the remainder of his fleet. And so, sailing in a fast ship
                        with a steady wind, three days later with a few warships he came into sight

                            inconsistencies are the embarkation of all the legions aboard the
                            warships and the capriciousness of the wind, which favoured the warships

                        the rest of his fleet, had, with a few exceptions, been scattered by the
                        wind and, losing their course, made for various points along the coast. He
                        sailed on past Clupea with his fleet, and then past Neapolis; and besides
                        these places he passed by quite a number of strongholds and towns not far
                        from the sea. <note type="margin" n="3"/> When Caesar reached Hadrumetum,
                        where his opponents had a garrison commanded by C. Con- </p>



                    <pb n="151"/>

                    <p> sidius. Cn. Piso made his appearance there with approximately three thousand
                        Moorish troops, approaching Hadrumetum with his cavalry along the sea coast
                        from Clupea whereupon Caesar paused for a little while in front of the port,
                        waiting for the rest of his ships to assemble, and then landed his army,
                        which numbered at present three thousand infantry and a hundred-and-fifty
                        cavalry. He then pitched camp in front of the town and established himself
                        without molesting anyone, looting being universally forbidden. Meanwhile the
                        occupants of the town manned their battlements with armed troops, and massed
                        in front of the gate to defend themselves: their numbers amounted to the
                        equivalent of two legions. Caesar rode round the town carefully observing
                        the lie of the land, and then returned to camp. Some blamed him for lack of
                        foresight because he had not originally briefed his pilots and captains
                        about what points on the coast they were to make for, and had not, as had
                        been his own habitual practice on previous occasions, issued sealed
                        instructions to be read at a specified time, so that they could all make for
                        a given rendezvous together. But this was by no means an oversight on
                        Caesar's part; in fact, he surmised that there was no port on African soil
                        where his fleet could run ashore and which he could count on as immune from
                        the enemy's protection; and failing that, he was on the watch for luck to
                        present him with an opportunity to land. <note type="margin" n="4"/>
                        Meanwhile one of his lieutenants, L. Phineus, asked Caesar to give him
                        authority to treat with Considius, if by any means he could be brought to
                        see reason. Permission being granted, he accordingly wrote a letter, which
                        he gave to a prisoner to take to </p>

                    <p> Considius in the town. As soon as the prisoner had arrived there, and when
                        he was in the very act of [landing Considius the letter in accordance with
                        his instructions, the latter remarked before accepting it: ' Where did you
                        get this? ' Whereupon the prisoner replied: ' From the commander-in-chief.
                        Caesar.' Then Considius retorted: 'There is but one commander-in-chief of
                        the Roman people at the moment, namely Scipio.' He then ordered the prisoner
                        to be executed forthwith in his presence, and gave the letter—still unread
                        and with its seals intact—to a reliable messenger to take to Scipio. <note

                        were spent under the walls of the town without any reply being given by
                        Considius: moreover, the rest of Caesar's forces failed to arrive to
                        reinforce him; he had no abundance of cavalry and insufficient forces to
                        assault the town, and those he had were mere recruits; he was loath to let
                        his army suffer heavy casualties immediately on its arrival; the defences of
                        the town were remarkably strong, its lofty position rendering it difficult
                        to attack; and reports were coming in that large reinforcements of cavalry
                        were on their way to aid the occupants of the town. For these reasons there
                        seemed no point in staying on for the purpose of attacking the town, lest,
                        while engaged in that task, Caesar might be surrounded in the rear by the
                        enemy cavalry and so find himself in difficulties. <note type="margin" n="6"
                        /> Caesar therefore was minded to strike camp and while he was doing so a
                        large body of men suddenly sallied forth from the town, and were reinforced
                        simultaneously, as it chanced, by some cavalry sent by Juba to collect their
                        pay: they seized Caesar's camp. which he had just quitted to begin his
                        march. </p>

                    <p> and began to pursue his rearguard. On seeing this the legionary troops came
                        to an abrupt halt, while the cavalry, few as they were, nevertheless
                        displayed the utmost gallantry in charging against such vast numbers. An
                        incredible thing took place: less than thirty Gallic cavalry dislodged two
                        thousand Moorish cavalry and drove them to take refuge in the town. After
                        they had been repulsed and hurled back within their fortifications, Caesar
                        made haste to proceed with his projected march. But as the enemy repeated
                        these tactics all too frequently—now following in pursuit, now once again
                        driven back into the town by the cavalry—Caesar posted in the rear of his
                        column a few cohorts of the veteran troops which he had with him, as well as
                        part of his cavalry, and so proceeded to march at a slow pace with the
                        remainder of his force. In this way the further they withdrew from the town,
                        the slower were the Numidians to pursue them. Meanwhile in the course of his
                        march deputations arrived from towns and strongholds with promises of corn
                        and assurances of their readiness to carry out any orders he might give
                        them. And so on that day he pitched camp near the town of Ruspina. <note
                            type="margin" n="7"/> From there he moved camp on January 1st and
                        arrived at the town of Leptis, a free community, immune from taxes.<note

                        came from the town to meet him and promised they would readily do whatever
                        he wished. Accordingly, he posted centurions and picquets at the town gates,
                        to prevent any soldier from entering it or molesting any inhabitant, and
                        then made his camp adjoining the shore, not far from the town. And it so
                        chanced that some of his transports and warships arrived at this same place:
                        as for the rest of them, it appeared from the reports </p>

                    <p> which reached him that owing to their uncertain knowledge of the district
                        they were making towards Utica. For the time being Caesar would not leave
                        the sea or strike inland on account of these wayward vessels, and kept all
                        his cavalry aboard ship, his purpose being, I imagine, to prevent their
                        pillaging the countryside: as for water, he ordered it to be carried aboard.
                        Meanwhile Caesar's troops were taken by surprise when some rowers who had
                        disembarked to fetch water were suddenly set upon by Moorish cavalry, who
                        wounded many with their lances and killed some of them. These Moors in fact
                        lurk in ambush with their horses in the wadis, so as to start up suddenly
                        and not to fight it out hand to hand in the plain. <note type="margin" n="8"
                        /> Meanwhile Caesar sent messengers to Sardinia and the other neighbouring
                        provinces with despatches instructing them to take steps, immediately on
                        reading the despatch, to send him reinforcements, supplies and corn. He also
                        unloaded some of his warships and sent Rabirius Postumius to Sicily to fetch
                        a second convoy. He ordered Vatinius to set out with ten warships to search
                        for the remaining transports which had gone astray, and at the same time to
                        keep the sea safe from enemy raiders. He likewise ordered the praetor C.
                        Sallustius Crispus to proceed with a detachment of ships to the island of
                        Ccreina, whieh was under enemy occupation, as he heard that there was a
                        great quantity of corn there. These orders and instructions he issued to
                        each individual in such terms as to rule out any excuses as to whether or
                        not they could be carried out, and to prevent any shuffling involving delay.

                        country, in the company of their own citizens, secure in the possession of
                        their own fortunes. <note type="margin" n="9"/> On January 2nd Caesar moved
                        his camp. Leaving behind at Leptis a garrison of six cohorts with Saserna,
                        he himself returned with his remaining forces back to Ruspina, whence he had
                        come the previous day. There the army's baggage was left, and he himself set
                        out with a force in light order to forage round the farms, issuing
                        instructions to the townsfolk that all their carts and draught animals must
                        go with him; and so, after finding a large quantity of corn, he returned to

                        rather, by securing them with garrisons, to fortify them as strongholds for

                        should be conveyed into the town, he left the town of Ruspina and made for
                        its harbour, which is two miles distant. With him he took seven cohorts
                        which were drawn from veteran legions and had seen service aboard the fleet

                        Africa with a tiny force—and that too of recruits, and not all of it
                        disembarked— pitted against large forces including the limitless cavalry of

                        save in the expression of their commander himself, and his energy and
                        remarkable cheerfulness for he displayed a high and buoyant spirit. It was
                        in him that his men found peace of mind: his skill and resolution would,
                        they all hoped, make everything run smoothly for them. <note type="margin"
                            n="11"/> After spending one night aboard his fleet Caesar was proceeding
                        to set out at the first pale light of dawn, when suddenly the squadron about
                        which he was apprehensive sought haven there from its wanderings. On
                        learning of this, Caesar promptly ordered everyone to disembark and, drawn
                        up under arms on the beach, to await the arrival of the rest of his troops.
                        And so when these ships had been brought without delay into port, with their
                        cargo of infantry and cavalry, Caesar once again returned to the town of
                        Ruspina, drew up his camp there, and then set out himself with thirty
                        cohorts in light order to forage. As a result of this Caesar's plan now
                        became known: it had been his intention to go with his fleet to the
                        assistance of those transports which had gone astray, but to do so without
                        the enemy's knowing of it, lest by chance his own ships might run unawares
                        against his opponents' fleet; <!-- "G" on the bottom of the page. -->

                        lest, on account of their own small numbers and the multitude of the enemy,
                        fear should make them fail in their duty. <note type="margin" n="12"
                        />Meanwhile, when Caesar had now advanced about three miles from his camp,
                        information obtained by his scouts and mounted patrols reached him that the
                        enemy's forces had been sighted by them at no great distance. And indeed
                        simultaneously with that information they began to see a great cloud of
                        dust. On learning this, Caesar promptly gave orders for his entire cavalry
                        force—of which arm he had no great abundance available at the moment—-and
                        his small contingent of archers to be summoned from the camp, and for the
                        standards to follow him slowly in their regular order: he himself went on
                        ahead with a small armed party. Now that the enemy could be seen in the
                        distance, he ordered the troops to don their helmets and prepare for battle
                        in the open plain: their total number comprised thirty cohorts, together
                        with four hundred <note type="footnote" n="1" place="opposite">1 The number

                        infantry, but with cavalry, interspersed with light-armed Numidians and
                        unmounted archers in such close formation that at a distance Caesar's men
                        supposed them to be infantry: the two wings—to right and left—were
                        reinforced with strong detachments of cavalry. Meanwhile Caesar deployed a
                        single straight line— the most his small numbers allowed; he drew up his
                        archers in front of the line and posted cavalry to cover his right and left
                        wings, with instructions to </p>

                        supposed that he would be engaging infantry troops in the set battle line.
                            <note type="margin" n="14"/> There was now on either side a growing
                        feeling of expectancy; but Caesar made no move and saw that the smallness of
                        his own forces called for the use of strategy rather than a trial of
                        strength against the vast numbers of the enemy; when suddenly his opponents'
                        cavalry began to deploy, extending towards the flanks and enveloping the
                        high ground, causing Caesar's cavalry to lengthen and weaken their
                        formation, and preparing simultaneously for an encircling movement. Caesar's
                        cavalry found it difficult to bear up against their vast numbers. Meanwhile
                        as the two centres were proceeding to charge one another, suddenly from out
                        of the closely packed squadrons the light-armed Numidian infantry doubled
                        forward alongside the cavalry and hurled their javelins among the infantry
                        of the legions. Hereupon Caesar's men launched an attack upon them and their
                        cavalry took to flight; but the infantry stood their ground meantime, until
                        the cavalry should renew their charge and return to succour their own
                        infantry. <note type="margin" n="15"/> Caesar was now confronted with novel
                        tactics and observed that his men's formation was becoming disorganised as
                        they ran forward to attack—the infantry in fact, exposing their flank as
                        they advanced in pursuit of the cavalry too far from the standards, were
                        suffering casualties from the javelins of the nearest Numidians: whereas the
                        enemy cavalry easily eluded by their speed the heavy infantry javelin.
                        Accordingly, he had the order passed down the ranks that no soldier should
                        advance more </p>



                    <pb n="167"/>

                    <p> than four feet from the standards. Meanwhile the cavalry of Labienus,
                        relying on the large numbers on their own side, endeavoured to surround
                        Caesar's scanty force and the mere handful of Julian cavalry, worn out by
                        the enemy hordes, their horses wounded, gave ground little by little, while
                        the enemy pressed on them more and more. Thus in a moment all the
                        legionaries were surrounded by the enemy cavalry, and Caesar's forces were
                        compressed into a circle; and so they were all compelled to fight penned
                        behind bars as it were. <note type="margin" n="16"/> Labienus rode
                        bare-headed up and down the front line, encouraging his own men the while
                        and occasionally accosting Caesar's legionaries in such terms as these: '
                        What are you up to, recruit? Quite the dashing little fellow, aren't you?
                        Have all of you too been made fools of by that fellow's words? So help me,
                        it's a very dangerous situation he has driven you into. I feel sorry for
                        you.' ' I'm not a recruit, Labienus,' replied one soldier,' but a veteran of
                        the Tenth legion.' To this Labienus retorted: I don't recognise the
                        standards of the Tenth.' Then said the soldier: 'You'll soon see what I'm
                        made of.' As he spoke the words he flung the helmet from his head so that
                        the other could recognise him and, thus uncovered, brandished his heavy
                        javelin with all his force, as he aimed it at Labienus: then plunging it
                        violently full in the horse's chest he said: ' That will teach yon,
                        Labienus, that it's a soldier of the Tenth who is attacking you.' All the
                        troops, however, were demoralised, particularly the recruits for they kept
                        looking round for Caesar and contented themselves with dodging the enemy
                        javelins. </p>

                    <p>
                        <note type="margin" n="17"/> Meanwhile Caesar, aware of the enemy's tactics,
                        gave orders for the line to be extended to its maximum length, and for every
                        other cohort to turn about, so that one was facing to the rear of the
                        standards, while the next one faced to their front. By this means with his
                        right and left wing he split in half the encircling enemy force: and having
                        isolated one half from the other with his cavalry, proceeded to attack it
                        from inside with his infantry, turning it to flight with volleys of
                        missiles: then, after advancing no great distance for fear of ambush, he
                        retired to his own lines. The other half of Caesar's cavalry and infantry
                        carried out the same tactics. This task accomplished and the enemy being
                        driven far back with heavy casualties, Caesar began to retire to his own
                        defence positions, maintaining battle formation. <note type="margin" n="18"
                        /> Meanwhile M. Petreius and Cn. Piso arrived with Numidian troops—sixteen
                        hundred picked cavalry and a fairly considerable force of infantry—and
                        immediately on arrival hastened straight to the aid of their comrades. And
                        so the enemy, putting their fears aside and taking fresh heart and courage,
                        wheeled their cavalry round and began to attack the rear of the retreating
                        legionaries and to hinder their withdrawal to camp. Observing this, Caesar
                        ordered to turn about and renew the battle in the middle of the plain. As
                        the enemy repeated the same manoeuvre, but without any return to
                        hand-to-hand fighting, and as Caesar's cavalry found that their horses, worn
                        out with the effects of recent seasickness, thirst and the fatigue and
                        wounds sustained in their unequal contest, were now more reluctant to keep
                        doggedly on the move in pursuit of the enemy, </p>



                    <pb n="171"/>

                    <p> and as there was now but a little daylight left, Caesar urged his encircled
                        cohorts and cavalry to make one vigorous thrust and not give up until they
                        had driven the enemy back beyond the furthest high ground and gained
                        possession of the latter. And so, waiting to give the signal until the
                        enemy's volleys of missiles were half-hearted and inaccurate, he suddenly
                        let loose some cohorts and squadrons of his own troops upon them. In a
                        moment the enemy were driven without trouble off the plain and thrown back
                        behind the high ground, and Caesar's men had gained the position then, after
                        a brief pause there, they retired slowly in battle formation to their own
                        fortifications. Their opponents likewise, after this warm reception, then at
                        length withdrew to their own positions. <note type="margin" n="19"/>
                        Meanwhile after this engagement had taken place and when the action had been
                        broken off, quite a number of all ranks of the opposing side deserted to
                        Caesar, and in addition not a few of the enemy cavalry and infantry were
                        taken prisoner. From them the enemy's plan became known. He had come with
                        the intention of trying out new and unfamiliar battle tactics upon Caesar's
                        legionaries, in order that—raw reernits and few in numbers as they were—they
                        should be demoralised thereby, and be enveloped and crushed by the cavalry,
                        as Curio had been; and Labienus had spoken to this effect to his troops on
                        parade, that he would furnish Caesar's opponents with so vast a number of
                        auxiliaries that Caesar's men would be quite exhausted even with killing
                        them, and so would be vanquished in the very hour of victory, and mastered
                        by his forces. In fact, quite apart from the aid of those auxiliaries, he
                        had reason for self-confidence: first because he had heard </p>



                    <pb n="173"/>

                    <p> that at Rome the veteran legions were mutinous and refusing to cross into
                        Africa; next because he had kept his own troops in Africa for three years:
                        they were acclimatised and he had now secured their loyalty to himself; he
                        had, moreover, very large auxiliary forces composed of Numidian cavalry and
                        light-armed troops and, besides these, the German and Gallic cavalry which,
                        after the defeat and rout of Pompeius, he, Labienus, had brought across with
                        him from Buthrotum, as well as those which he had levied later on in Africa
                        from half-castes, freedmen and slaves, and had armed and taught to handle a
                        bridled horse: he had in addition royal auxiliary forces, as well as a
                        hundred and twenty elephants and innumerable cavalry; and finally, legions
                        raised from more than twelve thousand men of every type. On such
                        considerations was based the reckless confidence that fired Labienus, with
                        his sixteen hundred Gallic and German cavalry, his eight thousand Numidians
                        who rode without bridles, reinforced in addition by the cavalry contingent
                        of Petreius, sixteen hundred strong, and with his infantry and light-armed
                        force, four times as big, and with his numerous archers, slingers and
                        mounted archers. These were the forces which on January 4th, five days after
                        Caesar reached Africa, on a perfectly flat and unimpeded plain were engaged
                        in a contest from the fifth hour of the day continuously till sundown. In
                        that battle Petreius was gravely wounded and retired from the field. <note
                            type="margin" n="20"/> Meanwhile Caesar fortified his camp with greater
                        care, strengthened its defences by manning them with larger forces, and
                        carried an entrenchment from the town of Ruspina right to the sea, and a
                        second </p>



                    <pb n="175"/>

                    <p> from his camp likewise to the sea: his purpose was to ensure safer
                        communication in both directions and to enable his reinforcements to come up
                        to his support without danger. He brought missiles and artillery from the
                        ships into his camp, and armed some of the Gallic and Rhodian rowers and
                        marines from the fleet and summoned them to camp, in order that, if
                        possible, on the same principle which his opponents had employed,
                        light-armed troops should be interspersed at intervals among his cavalry.
                        From all his ships he brought archers into camp—Ityreans, Syrians and men of
                        divers races—and thronged his forces with numerous drafts of them; for he
                        heard that on the second day after the battle was fought Scipio was
                        approaching and uniting his forces— reported to comprise eight legions and
                        three thousand cavalry—with those of Labienus and Petreius. He also
                        established smithies, took steps to ensure a plentiful supply of arrows and
                        missile-weapons, cast leaden bullets, collected stakes, and sent couriers
                        with despatches to Sicily bidding them build up for his use stocks of
                        hurdles and timber for battering-rams—timber was scarce in Africa—and in
                        addition send him iron and lead. He realised, moreover, that no corn could
                        be available for his use in Africa unless it was imported; for there had
                        been no harvest the previous year on account of the levies held by his
                        opponents and the fact that the farmers, being tributary subjects of Rome,
                        had been called up for military service: moreover, his opponents had
                        collected corn from the whole of Africa and conveyed it into a few
                        well-fortified towns, and every corner of Africa was thus ransacked of corn
                        and apart from those few towns which his opponents </p>



                    <pb n="177"/>

                    <p> were able to defend themselves with their own garrisons, the rest were being
                        destroyed and abandoned: their inhabitants had been compelled to migrate to
                        the shelter of the enemy garrisons, and their lands were now abandoned and
                        laid waste. <note type="margin" n="21"/> Under stress of this emergency
                        Caesar had, by soliciting private individuals with touching appeals, amassed
                        a certain amount of corn in his garrisons, and this he was using sparingly.
                        Meanwhile every day he went round the field-works in person, and doubled the
                        number of cohorts on guard duty in view of the large numbers of the enemy.
                        Labienus gave orders that his wounded, who were very numerous, should have
                        their wounds dressed and then be carried in carts to Hadrumetum. Meanwhile
                        some of Caesar's transports were cruising aimlessly about, badly off their
                        course in their uncertain knowledge of the area and the position of his
                        camp; and one by one they were set upon by a number of enemy pinnaces and
                        set on fire or boarded. When this was reported to Caesar he posted squadrons
                        round the islands and harbours to enable his supplies to be convoyed with
                        greater safety. <note type="margin" n="22"/> Meanwhile M. Cato, who was in
                        command at Utica, never left off assailing Cn. Pompeius, the son, with long
                        and constant speeches of reproof. ' When your father was your age,' he said,

                        days, he made a night march and joined up with the forces of Labienus and
                        Petreius; whereupon they established themselves in a single camp three miles

                        learning of king Juba's departure, moved them closer to his kingdom. Sittius
                        then attacked Cirta, the richest town of that kingdom, and after a few days'
                        fighting captured it, as well as two Gaetulian towns. When he offered them
                        terms, proposing that they should evacuate the town and surrender it
                        unoccupied to him, they refused the terms and were subsequently captured by
                        Sittius and all put to death. Thereupon he advanced, ravaging both
                        countryside and towns without ceasing. Juba got to know of this when he was
                        now not far away from Scipio and his lieutenants, and came to the conclusion
                        that it was better to go to the aid of himself and his own kingdom, rather
                        than that, in the course of setting out to help others, he should himself be
                        driven out of his own kingdom, and perhaps be thwarted in both fields.
                        Accordingly, he marched back again, withdrawing his auxiliary forces too
                        from Scipio, in his alarm on account of himself and his own interests and
                        leaving thirty elephants behind with Scipio, he set forth to the relief of
                        his own territory and towns. <note type="margin" n="26"/> Meanwhile as there
                        was some doubt in the province as to Caesar's arrival, and nobody believed

                        some one of his lieutenants, he sent written despatches round the province
                        informing all the communities of his personal arrival. Meanwhile persons of

                        harshness of his opponents. Their tears and complainings had no little
                        effect on Caesar; and though he had previously decided to wait for the
                        beginning of summer to muster all his forces and auxiliaries from their
                        permanent quarters and wage war on his opponents, he now resolved on a
                        winter campaign, promptly drafting a despatch to Alienus and Rabirins
                        Postumus in Sieily, which he sent by a reconnaissance vessel, to the effect
                        that an army must be shipped across to him as quickly as possible: there
                        must be no delay and no excuses on the ground of wintry weather or adverse
                        winds. The province of Africa, he wrote, was in its death throes, in the
                        process of utter destruction at the hands of his foes and unless aid were
                        promptly rendered to their allies, nothing save the very soil of Africa—not
                        even a roof to give them shelter—would be left as the result of their
                        enemies' treacherous crimes. Caesar himself was in such a ferment of
                        impatient expectancy that on the day after he sent the messenger to Sieily
                        with the despatch he kept saving that the fleet and army were dallying; and
                        day and night he kept his eyes and attention bent and riveted upon the sea.
                        And no wonder; for he perceived that farms were being burned to the ground,
                        fields stripped, herds plundered or butchered, towns and strongholds
                        destroyed and abandoned, and the principal citizens either murdered or held
                        in chains, and their children haled off to slavery on the pretext of being
                        hostages: yet to these folk, who in their misery implored his protection, he
                        could give no assistance because his forces were so few. Meanwhile he kept
                        his troops continuously at work on their training, proceeded </p>

                        constructing towers and redoubts and driving moles out into the sea. <note
                            type="margin" n="27"/> Scipio meanwhile undertook the training of the
                        elephants in the following manner. He drew up two lines of battle: one line
                        of slingers, facing the elephants, to take the place of the enemy and to
                        discharge small stones against the opposing front formed by the elephants;
                        next he arranged the elephants in line, and behind them drew up his own line
                        so that, when the enemy proceeded to sling their stones and the elephants in
                        their consequent panic wheeled round upon their own side, his men should
                        receive them with a volley of stones, and so make them wheel round again
                        away from his own line in the direction of the enemy. This method worked,
                        though it was a difficult and slow process for elephants are uncouth
                        creatures, and it is difficult to get them fully trained even with many
                        years' training and long practice; and if they are led forth to battle, they
                        are, for all their training, equally dangerous to both sides. <note

                        Ruspina by the leaders on either side, the ex-praetor C. Vergilius, who was
                        in charge of the coastal town of Thapsus, observed that ships carrying
                        Caesar's troops were sailing singly on no set course, due to their uncertain
                        knowledge of the locality and of the position of his camp. He therefore
                        seized the opportunity and manned with soldiers and archers a fast boat
                        which he had there, to which he added some ship's pinnaces, and with these
                        he set about the pursuit of Caesar's ships one by one. He had attacked
                        several, only to be beaten off, put to flight and forced to quit the area,

                        of the Fifth legion, whose father Caesar had caused to be elected to the
                        Senate—as well as T. Salienus, a centurion of the same legion, who had laid

                        to Caesar's triumph, and for these reasons viewed his own prospects with
                        misgiving. His own guilty conscience led him to persuade the young men to
                        put up no resistance, but to surrender to Vergilius. Accordingly they were
                        escorted by Vergilius to Scipio, put under guard, and two days later put to
                        death. As they were being led to execution, the elder Titius, it is said,
                        besought the centurions to put him to death before his brother. and was
                        readily granted that request, and they were put to death in that order.

                        so chanced that a squadron had halted in massed formation in front of the

                        Meanwhile practically every day Scipio arrayed his line of battle at no
                        great distance—three hundred paces—from his own camp, and then, when the
                        greater part of the day was now spent, returned back again to camp. As this
                        manoeuvre was carried out quite frequently without anyone's issuing forth
                        from Caesar's camp or approaching closer to Scipio's forces, the latter,
                        holding scorn of the forbearance shewn by Caesar and his army, led forth his
                        entire force, with thirty elephants equipped with towers drawn up in front
                        of his line: then, advancing and simultaneously deploying to the widest

                        that, making use of look-outs and orderlies, he issued the instructions
                        necessary for his purpose as he sat in his head-quarters. For he observed
                        that, although his opponents were relying on the great size of their forces,
                        yet they were the very men whom he himself had often routed, beaten back and
                        utterly demoralised, only to spare their lives and forgive their
                        misdemeanours; in which circumstances, considering their own lack of
                        initiative and their guilty conscience, they would never muster sufficient
                        confidence in victory as to venture to attack his camp. Moreover, his own
                        name and prestige had, to a great extent, a sobering effect upon the
                        reckless spirit of their army. Then again the exceptional defences of the
                        camp—the height of the rampart, the depth of the ditches, and the concealed
                        stakes outside the rampart, marvellously well planted—all these, even
                        without defenders, served to deter the enemy's approach while as for
                        scorpions, catapults and all the other normal weapons of defence, he had a
                        plentiful supply of these. These he had prepared in advance in view of the
                        small size and lack of experience of his army as it then was, and it was not
                        because he was taken aback or dismayed at the

                        and timid. The reason why he would not lead his forces on to the field, few
                        and inexperienced though they were, was not that he lacked confidence in his
                        victory, but he considered the important question was—what manner of victory
                        it would prove for he thought it a personal slur if after all his
                        achievements, after all the many brilliant victories he had won over such
                        massive armies, men should look upon this victory as one gained only with
                        much bloodshed over such remnants as his opponents had mustered from their
                        routed forces. And so he had resolved to endure their boastful triumph until
                        his second convoy should join him, including some portion of his veteran
                        legions. <note type="margin" n="32"/> Meanwhile Scipio lingered for a little
                        while, as I mentioned earlier, in that position, to create the impression
                        that he had held Caesar virtually in contempt, and then gradually withdrew
                        his forces to camp. There he paraded his troops and spoke to them of the
                        dread which their own side inspired and the desperate attitude of Caesar's
                        army; and with such words of encouragement to his men he promised them that
                        he would shortly give them a lasting victory. Caesar ordered his troops to
                        return once more to their duties and, on the pretext of the fortifications,
                        kept his recruits constantly employed to the point of exhaustion. Meanwhile
                        Numidians and Gaetulians were daily deserting from Scipio's camp: the former
                        betook themselves to Juba's kingdom, while the latter, because they
                        themselves and their ancestors had been kindly treated by C. Marius <note
                            type="footnote" n="1" place="opposite">1 The famous soldier and

                            towards the Gaetulians, who had presumably served him well as
                            mercenaries in his campaigns against Jugurtha (109-106). As some 60
                            years had now elapsed, it would seem that very few, if any, of the
                            present Gaetulians could themselves have been kindly treated by Marius.

                    <p> that Caesar was a relation of his, swarmed constantly for refuge into
                        Caesar's camp. From among their number Caesar chose certain more
                        distinguished members, gave them letters for their fellow citizens, and so
                        dismissed them, exhorting them to raise a force for the defence of
                        themselves and their people, and not to submit passively to the dictates of
                        their foes and opponents. <note type="margin" n="33"/> While these events
                        were taking place at Ruspina, there came to Caesar envoys from Acylla, an
                        independent state immune from taxes.<note type="footnote" n="1">1 See ch. 7,

                            of ch. 43. But it seems very doubtful whether V. would have detached
                            precious troops to garrison a spot so far south; and this objection,

                            Leptis and Ruspina, led Veith to place it some 4 km. S. E. of
                            Leptis.</note> They assured him that they would readily and gladly do
                        whatever he might bid: they merely prayed and besought him to give them a
                        garrison to enable them to do his bidding with the greater safety and
                        without peril: they would supply its members with corn and with all other
                        adequate supplies for the sake of their common welfare. This request Caesar
                        readily granted and gave them a garrison, ordering C. Messius, who had once
                        held the office of aedile, to set out for Acylla. On learning this,
                        Considius Longus, who was in command at Hadrumetum with two legions and
                        seven hundred cavalry, left part of his garrison force behind and, taking
                        eight cohorts with him, promptly hastened off to Acylla. Messius completed
                        his march more rapidly and was the first to arrive at Acylla with his
                        cohorts. Whereupon Considius approached the city with his forces and
                        observed that Caesar's garrison was there and not venturing to jeopardies
                        his troops, retired back again to Hadrumetum without having achieved
                        anything to warrant so large a force. Subsequently, </p>

                        he returned, pitched his camp and proceeded to lay siege to Acylla. <note
                            type="margin" n="34"/> It was during this time that C. Sallustius
                        Crispus, who, as we have explained, had been despatched by Caesar with a
                        fleet a few days earlier, arrived at Cercina. On his arrival the exquaestor
                        C. Decimius, who was controller of supplies there and was attended by a
                        large escort composed of his own household slaves, went aboard a small boat
                        he had got hold of and took to flight. Meanwhile Sallustius, the praetor,
                        was welcomed by the inhabitants of Cercina; and finding a large quantity of
                        corn he loaded some merchant vessels—there was quite a large number of them
                        there—and sent them to Caesar in his camp. Meanwhile at Lilybaeum the
                        proconsul Alienus embarked in transports the Thirteenth and Fourteenth
                        legions, eight hundred Gallic cavalry and one thousand slingers and archers,
                        and sent to Caesar in Africa his second convoy. With the wind behind them
                        these ships arrived safely three days later at the harbour of Ruspina, the
                        town where Caesar had his camp. This heartened Caesar, who experienced
                        twofold pleasure and delight at thus simultaneously receiving both corn and
                        reinforcements: and now that at last his troops were made cheerful and the
                        corn problem was eased, he laid aside his cares, ordered his legions and
                        cavalry to disembark and get over the effects of their lassitude and
                        seasickness, and drafted them to the various forts and defended positions.
                            <note type="margin" n="35"/> All this filled Scipio and his colleagues
                        with wonder and curiosity; and they had a suspicion that some deep purpose
                        must underlie this sudden transforma- </p>

                    <p> tion in the C. Caesar who had habitually taken the offensive hitherto and
                        was always spoiling for a fight. And so, thrown into no little panic as a
                        result of his forbearance, they chose from the Gaetulians two men whom they
                        considered to be the staunchest supporters of their cause; and after
                        offering them large rewards and making them generous promises, sent them in
                        the guise of deserters on a spying mission into Caesar's camp. No sooner had
                        these men been escorted to Caesar than they sought leave to speak out
                        frankly without danger. That leave being granted, they said: ' Many of us
                        Gaetulians, Commander-in-Chief, who are clients <note type="footnote" n="1"

                        Marius, and practically all the Roman citizens who are in the Fourth and
                        Sixth legions have very often wanted to take refuge with you and resort to
                        your protection; but we were prevented from doing so without hazard by the
                        patrols of Numidian cavalry. But now that the chance has been given us we
                        have come to you most eagerly. We were in fact sent by Scipio as spies to
                        observe closely whether any trenches or traps had been made for the
                        elephants in front of the camp and the gates of the rampart; and at the same
                        time to ascertain your tactics against these same beasts and your
                        dispositions for battle, and then report back to them.' Caesar highly
                        commended them, furnished them with pay, and had them taken to join the
                        other deserters. Their statement was speedily verified by actual events; for
                        on the next day quite a number of legionary troops from the legions
                        mentioned by the Gaetulians deserted from Scipio to Caesar's camp. <note

                        drafting them to Scipio's camp to be at his disposal. Meanwhile there came
                        to Caesar envoys from the town of Thysdra, in which town three hundred
                        thousand measures <note type="footnote" n="1" place="opposite">1 =
                            approximately 71,000 bushels.</note> of wheat had been collected by
                        Italian merchants and farmers. These envoys now informed Caesar of the large
                        quantity of corn they had and prayed him to send them a garrison whereby
                        both their corn and all their stocks might the more readily be kept safe.
                        For the present Caesar expressed his thanks to them, saying that, as for a
                        garrison, he would send one shortly; he then dismissed them with words of
                        encouragement, bidding them go back to their own countrymen. Meanwhile P.
                        Sittius invaded the territory of Numidia with his forces and forcibly took
                        by storm a stronghold, situated on a well-defended mountain height, in which
                        Juba had collected both corn and all other regular munitions of war, for the
                        sake of prosecuting his campaign. <note type="margin" n="37"/> Now that
                        Caesar had reinforced his troops with two veteran legions, cavalry and
                        light-armed forces from his second convoy, he gave orders that the ships,
                        now unloaded, should set sail forthwith for Lilybaeum to bring across the
                        rest of his army. On January 25. at approximately the first watch,<note

                        without anyone's knowing or suspecting his plan, at the third watch he
                        ordered all his legions to be led outside the camp and follow him in the
                        direction of the town of Ruspina, where he had a garrison; </p>

                        gentle slope and, keeping to the left side of the plain, led his legions
                        along close to the sea.<note type="footnote" n="1" place="opposite">1 See

                        appearance of a kind of amphitheatre. This chain includes a few high hills,
                        on each of which were situated some very ancient turrets and watch-towers

                        climbed up to the ridge I have described and visited each individual hill
                        and tower, he proceeded to construct redoubts and these he completed in less
                        than half an hour; and when he was now not so very far away from the last
                        hill and turret, which was nearest the enemy camp and where, as I have
                        explained, there was a defence post and picket of Numidians, he paused for a
                        little while: then, after studying the lie of the land, he posted his
                        cavalry on guard and assigned to his legions their tasks, ordering them to
                        carry a line of fortifications straight along the middle of the chain, from
                        the point he had now reached tight up to the point from where he had
                        started. When Scipio and Labienus observed this, they led their entire
                        cavalry force out of camp and, deploying it in battle line, advanced about a
                        mile from their fortified positions and drew up their infantry forces in a
                        second battle line less than four hundred paces from their camp. </p>

                        <note type="margin" n="39"/> Caesar kept encouraging the troops as they
                        worked, quite unmoved by his opponents' forces. When he perceived that no
                        more than a mile and a half now separated the enemy ranks from his own

                        purpose of obstructing his troops and forcing them to abandon their task,
                        and as he considered that he must now perforce withdraw his legions from
                        their work of building fortifications, he ordered a squadron of Spaniards to
                        launch a speedy attack upon the adjacent hill, dislodge its enemy defenders,
                        and capture the position and he also instructed a small detachment of
                        light-armed troops to follow them in support to the same objective. Thus
                        despatched they speedily attacked the Numidians, capturing some of them
                        alive and seriously wounding others of their troopers as they sought to
                        escape, and so won the position. As soon as Labienus observed this, he
                        detached practically the entire right wing of the line of cavalry he had
                        deployed, so as the more speedily to render them assistance: and with this
                        force he made haste to proceed to the relief of his retreating troops. But
                        when Caesar saw that Labienus had now withdrawn some distance from his
                        forces, he launched the left wing of his own cavalry. so as to cut the enemy
                        off. <note type="margin" n="40"/> Now in the area where this action was
                        going on there was a very large farm building, constructed with four lofty
                        towers and this impeded Labienus' field of view and prevented his observing
                        that he was being cut off by Caesar's cavalry. Consequently it was only when
                        he realised that his men were being cut down from the rear that he actually
                        saw the Julian squadrons. As a result, triumph suddenly </p>

                    <p> gave place to panic among the Numidian cavalry, and Labienus made haste to
                        flee straight back to camp. As for the Gauls and Germans, they stood their
                        ground; but hemmed in between the enemy on the higher ground and those in
                        their rear, despite a gallant resistance they were slaughtered to a man. On
                        observing this, Scipio's legions, which were drawn up in front of his camp,
                        were seized with blind panic and began to flee by every gate into their
                        camp. Now that Scipio and his forces had been swept in disorder from plain
                        and hills and driven wholesale into their camp, Caesar ordered the retreat
                        to be sounded and withdrew all his cavalry inside his own fortifications;
                        and it was then, when the field had been cleared, that his attention was
                        caught by the amazing bodies of the Gauls and Germans: some of whom had
                        followed Labienus from Gaul in deference to his authority; others had been
                        induced to join him by rewards and promises; and there were yet others who,
                        having been made prisoners after Curio's defeat and their lives being
                        spared, had been anxious to give proof of their unswerving gratitude by
                        maintaining a correspondingly unswerving loyalty. These were the men whose
                        bodies, amazing in their beauty and stature, were lying mutilated and
                        prostrate here and there all over the battle-field. <note type="margin"
                            n="41"/> On the day following this action Caesar withdrew his cohorts
                        from all his defence posts and drew up all his forces in the plain: whereas
                        Scipio, after the disastrous reception his troops had met with and their
                        resulting heavy casualties in dead and wounded, proceeded to sit tight
                        within his own fortifications. Caesar deployed his battle line along the
                        lowest spurs of the chain of hills, and then slowly approached </p>

                    <pb n="211"/>

                    <p> closer to Scipio's fortifications. And now the Julian legions were less than
                        a mile away from the town of Uzitta, which Scipio held, when the latter,
                        fearing that he would lose the town, on which his army had been accustomed
                        to rely for its water supply and all other means of support, led out all his
                        forces. These forces were drawn up, according to his custom, in four lines,
                        the first consisting of cavalry deployed in line of squadrons, interspersed
                        with elephants equipped with towers and armour. Thus deployed. Scipio
                        marched to the relief of the town, while Caesar, observing this move and
                        supposing that Scipio was advancing towards him prepared and fully resolved
                        to fight, accordingly halted before the town in the position I described a
                        little earlier. With his own centre covered by the town, Scipio drew up his
                        right and left wings, where his elephants were, in full view of his
                        opponents. <note type="margin" n="42"/> Caesar had now waited till nearly
                        sunset without observing any signs of Scipio's leaving the position in which
                        he had halted and advancing towards him and his impression was that Scipio
                        would rather remain on the defensive, utilising his position, if the
                        circumstances demanded it, than venture to come to close grips on the plain.
                        Accordingly, there seemed no sense in approaching closer to the town that
                        day. For he was aware that it contained a large garrison force of Numidians,
                        and he realised that the enemy had used the town to screen his centre, and
                        that he himself was faced with a difficult task in simultaneously attacking
                        the town and at the same time engaging in battle on his right and left wing
                        from a disadvantageous position, the more especially so since his troops had

                        number, a centurion of the Fourteenth legion, then spoke as follows: ' For
                        your great kindness, Scipio—I refrain from calling you commander-in-chief—I
                        thank you, inasmuch as you promise me, by rights a prisoner of war, my life

                        wishes to his own centurions by a nod, causing the centurion to be executed
                        in his presence, and issuing instructions for the remaining veterans to be
                        segregated from the recruits. ' Away with these fellows,' said he, ' tainted

                        own citizens.' Accordingly, they were led outside the rampart and tortured
                        to death. As for the recruits, he ordered them to be drafted among the
                        legions, and would not allow Cominius and Ticida to be brought into his
                        presence. This incident disquieted Caesar, who took steps to punish those
                        whom he had instructed to be stationed with warships anchored out at sea on
                        guard off Thapsus, so as to give protection to his transports and
                        men-of-war: in view of their negligence he had them dismissed the service

                    <p> purpose in so doing was to add a certain prestige to Scipio's army by his
                        personal appearance, and the more to intimidate Caesar's. On reaching Scipio
                        he pitched a separate royal camp with the forces I have mentioned, and took
                        up a position not so far distant from Scipio. Now hitherto there had been
                        considerable apprehension in Caesar's camp: before Juba's arrival the
                        feeling of suspense was greater, and it was this which unsettled Caesar's
                        army as it was waiting for the royal forces but as soon as the king pitched
                        his camp close to theirs, they held his forces in contempt and all their
                        fears were laid aside. And so all the prestige with which his previous
                        absence had endowed the king he forfeited now that he was on the spot. That
                        the king's arrival in this manner gave Scipio additional courage and
                        confidence was a fact that anyone could readily appreciate: for on the
                        following day he led out his own and the king's entire forces, including
                        sixty elephants, and set them in battle array with as much pomp and
                        circumstance as possible, and then, after advancing somewhat farther than
                        usual from his fortified positions and pausing there a little while,
                        withdrew to camp. <note type="margin" n="49"/> When Caesar observed that
                        practically all the reinforcements that Scipio had been awaiting had now
                        forgathered and that there was nothing to delay an engagement, he began to
                        advance with his troops along the crest of the ridge, carrying forward his
                        lines of fortification and building strong points. He also made strenuous
                        efforts to seize the high ground closer to Scipio and. by capturing it, to
                        forestall his opponents, lest, relying on their superiority in numbers, they
                        should seize the nearby hill and so </p>


                    <pb n="223"/>

                    <p> deprive him of the opportunity of advancing farther. But Labienus too had
                        made up his mind to seize this hill; and his closer proximity to it had
                        enabled him to achieve the objective more rapidly. <note type="margin"
                            n="50"/> There was a ravine, of a fair width and with high, precipitous
                        sides, and honeycombed at many points with cave-like hollows and Caesar had
                        to cross it before he could reach the hill he wished to take. On the far
                        side of this ravine there was an ancient olive grove, dense and thickly
                        planted with trees. It was here that Labienus, perceiving that Caesar must
                        first cross the ravine and olive grove if he wanted to seize that position,
                        and availing himself of his local knowledge, took his stand in ambush with a
                        detachment of cavalry and some light-armed troops. In addition he had posted
                        some cavalry out of sight behind the range of hills, in order that, when he
                        himself unexpectedly launched his attack upon the legionaries, this cavalry
                        might make its appearance from behind the hill; thereby Caesar and his army
                        were to be thrown into utter confusion by this double attack and, denied the
                        opportunity either of retiring or advancing, were to be. surrounded and cut
                        to pieces. When Caesar, in ignorance of the ambush, but with a screen of
                        cavalry thrown out in front, came up to this position, the troops of
                        Labienus either misinterpreted or forgot his instructions, or maybe they
                        were afraid of being caught in the trap by Caesar's cavalry; anyway, they
                        came out from behind the rocks in small groups or singly, and made for the
                        crest of the hill. Caesar's cavalry pursued them, killing some and capturing
                        others alive, and then forthwith made all haste towards the hill, which they
                        speedily seized after dislodging </p>

                    <pb n="225"/>

                    <p> Labienus' holding force. Labienus and part of his cavalry barely managed to
                        escape with their lives. <note type="margin" n="51"/> After this action
                        fought by the cavalry Caesar fortified a camp on the hill of which he had
                        gained possession, assigning each legion its share of the work. He then
                        began to carry two fortified lines from his own principal camp across the
                        centre of the plain in the direction of the town of Uzitta—-which town was
                        situated on flat ground between his camp and Scipio's and was occupied by
                        the latter—-their direction being such as to make them converge upon the
                        tight and left corners of the town. His purpose in constructing this
                        field-work was as follows: when he advanced his forces closer to the town
                        and proceeded to attack it, he should have his flanks covered by these
                        fortifications of his and not he enveloped by the swarms of enemy cavalry
                        and so be deterred from attacking; moreover, it should make it easier to
                        hold conversations with the enemy, and if any of the latter wanted to
                        desert—this had often occurred in the past, but at great risk to the
                        deserters—it should now prove easy and devoid of risk. He was also anxious
                        to discover, when he approached closer to the enemy, whether they intended
                        to fight. Over and above these reasons was the additional fact that this was
                        a low-lying tract, and quite a few wells could be sunk in it: water in fact
                        was in short supply and had to be earned a long distance. While the
                        legionaries were engaged in this work of fortification which I have
                        mentioned above, a detachment of them took post in front of the work in
                        battle formation close to the enemy: for the latter's foreign cavalry and
                        part of his light-armed force kept skirmishing at close quarters.

                    <p>
                        <note type="margin" n="52"/>It was now nearly dusk, and Caesar was
                        withdrawing his troops from this work to camp, when Juba, Scipio and
                        Labienus launched a violent attack upon his legionaries, employing all their
                        cavalry and light-armed forces. Caesar's cavalry reeled and gave ground
                        momentarily under the sudden and violent impact of the massed swarms of the
                        enemy. But the latter found that this manoeuvre did not go according to
                        plan: for Caesar halted in his tracks and led his forces back to the
                        assistance of his cavalry. The arrival of the legions put fresh heart into
                        the cavalry, who wheeled round, charged the Numidians in the middle of their
                        eager, but scattered pursuit, and drove them right back into the royal camp,
                        with heavy casualties and many of their number killed. And had not nightfall
                        speedily overtaken this action, and a cloud of dust raised up by the wind
                        hampered everyone's vision, Juba and Labienus would have been captured and
                        have fallen into Caesar's hands, and their cavalry and light-armed troops
                        would have been utterly and entirely annihilated. Whereupon an incredible
                        number of Scipio's troops deserted from the Fourth and Sixth legion—some to
                        Caesar's camp, others to various places wherever each individual managed to
                        find refuge. The cavalry who were once under Curio's command <note
                            type="footnote" n="1" place="opposite">1 After the battle of the

                        and many of them took refuge with the others. <note type="margin" n="53"/>
                        While the leaders on either side were engaged in these operations in the
                        neighbourhood of Uzitta, two legions, the Tenth and the Ninth, which had
                        sailed from Sicily in transports, were now not far from the port of Ruspina.
                        Here they sighted those ships of </p>

                    <pb n="229"/>

                    <p> Caesar's which were stationed on patrol off Thapsus; and fearing they might
                        be falling unawares upon an enemy flotilla loitering there presumably with
                        treacherous designs, they made off out to sea. Many days later, exhausted by
                        thirst and privation after a long and very storm-tossed voyage, they at
                        length reached Caesar. <note type="margin" n="54"/> These legions were then
                        disembarked. Now Caesar had in mind the lack of discipline of old among the
                        troops in Italy and the plundering exploits of certain individuals: and he
                        had now some ground for complaint, though only a trifling one. in the fact
                        that C. Avienus, a military tribune of the Tenth legion, had commandeered a
                        vessel from the convoy and filled it with his own household slaves and
                        beasts of burden, without transporting a single soldier from Sieily.
                        Accordingly, on the following day Caesar paraded the tribunes and centurions
                        of all his legions and thus addressed them from the platform. ' I could have
                        wished above all things that people would at some time or other have set
                        bounds to their wanton and highly irresponsible behaviour, and had regard
                        for my own leniency, moderation and forbearance. However, since they set
                        themselves no limit or boundary, I myself will set them a precedent in
                        accordance with military custom, so that the remainder may behave somewhat
                        differently. Inasmuch as you, C. Avienus, in Italy have stirred up soldiers
                        of the Roman people against the state and have committed acts of plunder in
                        various municipal towns; inasmuch as you have proved useless to me and to
                        the state and have embarked, instead of troops, your own household slaves
                        and beasts of burden, so that thanks to you the state is short of </p>


                    <pb n="231"/>

                    <p> troops at a critical time for these reasons I hereby discharge you with
                        ignominy from my army and direct that you leave as soon as possible and be
                        quit of Africa this day. You also, A. Fonteius, I dismiss from my army, for
                        having proved a mutinous military tribune and a disloyal citizen. T.
                        Salienns, M. Tiro and C. Clusinas, you have attained your ranks in my army,
                        not by merit, but by favour; your conduct has been such as to prove you
                        neither brave in war, nor loyal nor competent in peace, and more eager to
                        stir up mutiny among the troops against your commander-in-chief than to
                        preserve respect and discipline: on these counts I deem yon to be unworthy
                        to hold rank in my army, and I hereby discharge you and direct that you be
                        quit of Africa as soon as possible.' Accordingly he handed them over to the
                        centurions, assigned them each no more than a single slave, and had them
                        embarked separately in a ship. <note type="margin" n="55"/> Meanwhile the
                        Gaetulian deserters who, as we have described above,<note type="footnote"
                            n="1">1 Ch. 32.</note> were sent by Caesar with despatches and
                        instructions, arrived back among their own citizens. The authority they held
                        readily induced their countrymen, who were also influenced by Caesar's
                        reputation, to revolt from king Juba and so they one and all promptly took
                        up arms and did not hesitate to oppose the king. On learning of this
                        situation king Juba, compelled as he now was by necessity to divide his
                        energies between three fronts, detached six cohorts from the force which he
                        had led against Caesar and sent them to his own royal domain to defend it
                        against the Gaetulians. </p>





                    <pb n="233"/>

                    <p>
                        <note type="margin" n="56"/> Caesar had now completed his lines of
                        fortification and extended them right up to a point so as to be just out of
                        range of spear-cast from the town. He then fortified a camp, ranging
                        catapults and scorpions at close intervals in front of it and training them
                        upon the town, and harrying without respite the defenders of its walls; he
                        also detached five legions from his former camp and brought them down to the
                        new one. Making use of the opportunity thus offered, certain more
                        distinguished persons and those of the widest acquaintance kept demanding to
                        see their friends and relations, and conversations ensued between them.
                        Caesar was not blind to the expediency of this turn of events; and in fact
                        some of the nobler Gaetulians among the royal cavalry, including captains of
                        horse, whose fathers had previously served with Marius and had, by his good
                        offices, been presented with farms and lands, but later on after Sulla's
                        victory had been handed over as subjects to king Hiempsal, seized their
                        chance and deserted, when it was night and the lamps were now lit, and came
                        with their horses and grooms—roughly a thousand of them—to Caesar's camp
                        which was situated in the plain close to Uzitta. <note type="margin" n="57"
                        />It was just about this time, after Scipio and his colleagues had come to
                        learn of this disconcerting setback, that they saw M. Aquinus holding a
                        conversation with C. Saserna. Scipio sent word to Aquinus saying that he had
                        no business to be holding a conversation with the enemy. When none the less
                        the messenger brought back to Scipio the other's answer, namely that on the
                        contrary it remained for him to complete the rest of his business, Juba also
                        sent him a courier, to say, in the hearing of Saserna: </p>



                    <pb n="235"/>

                    <p> ' The king forbids you to hold this conversation.' Alarmed by this message,
                        Aquinus withdrew in deference to the king's injunction. To think that it had
                        come to this, that a Roman citizen, one, moreover, who had received office
                        at the hands of the Roman people, at a time when his country and all his
                        fortunes stood secure, should rather have obeyed Juba, a foreigner, than
                        deferred to Scipio's instructions or else, if he preferred, let his own
                        partisans be massacred, while he himself returned home safe and sound! Still
                        more arrogant even was Juba's behaviour, not towards M. Aquinus, a mere
                        upstart and junior member of the Senate, but towards Scipio, whose family,
                        rank and magistracies were such as to make him an outstanding man. For
                        Scipio had been in the habit of wearing a purple cloak before the king
                        arrived and Juba—so it is said—took the matter up with him, saying that
                        Scipio ought not to wear the same dress as he himself wore. And so it came
                        about that Scipio changed to white dress in deference to Juba—that by-word
                        of arrogance and indolence. <note type="margin" n="58"/> On the next day the

                        certain prominent knoll, arrayed their battle line not far from Caesar's
                        camp, and took up their position there. Caesar likewise led forth his
                        forces, speedily arrayed them and took up a position in front of his
                        fortifications which were in the plain; for he thought, no doubt, that his
                        opponents, seeing they were equipped with such substantial forces and the
                        reinforcements supplied by the king, and had previously been quite prompt to
                        sally forth, would now take the initiative, advance towards him and join
                        battle. After riding round </p>

                        For he himself had good reason not to advance too far from his
                        fortifications, since the town of Uzitta, held by Scipio, contained enemy
                        cohorts under arms; moreover, his right-hand wing lay opposite the said
                        town, and he was afraid that, if he advanced beyond it, the enemy might make
                        a sally from the town, attack him in flank, and maul him severely. Apart
                        from this there was another reason too to make him pause, namely that in
                        front of Scipio's line there was a patch of very broken ground, which he
                        believed would prevent his troops from going over to the offensive. <note
                            type="margin" n="59"/> I do not think 1 ought to pass over without
                        mention the manner in which the armies of either side were deployed in
                        battle formation. Scipio's order of battle was as follows. In front he
                        placed his own and Juba's legions: behind these, in a support line, the
                        Numidians, drawn out in so thin and long a formation as to give the
                        impression at a distance that the centre was a single line composed of
                        legionary troops. His elephants he had placed at regular intervals on his
                        right and left wings, and behind the elephants his light-armed troops and
                        Numidian auxiliaries were stationed in support. On his right wing he had
                        posted his entire force of bridled cavalry for his left wing was covered by
                        the town of Uzitta, and there was no room to deploy cavalry. In addition he
                        had posted some Numidians and a vast multitude of light-armed troops to
                        cover the right flank of his line at a distance of at least a mile or so,
                        pushing them more towards the foothills and so withdrawing them farther away
                        both from the enemy and his own forces. His purpose in doing this was that
                        when </p>


                    <pb n="239"/>

                    <p> the two battle lines charged one another, his cavalry would only have to
                        continue their outflanking movement a little farther in the early stages of
                        the action, and then by sheer weight of numbers they could surprise and
                        envelop Caesar's army, throw it into disorder, and riddle it with lances.
                        Such was Scipio's plan of battle that day. <note type="margin" n="60"/>
                        Caesar's battle line, on the other hand, was disposed as follows, my
                        description beginning with his left wing and working round to his right. On
                        his left wing he had the Tenth and Ninth legions: in the centre the
                        Twenty-Fifth, Twenty-Ninth, Thirteenth, Fourteenth, Twenty-Eighth and
                        Twenty-Sixth. As for the actual right wing, he had posted there some of the
                        cohorts of his veteran legions as well as a few cohorts from the legions of
                        recruits besides. His third line he had concentrated on his left wing,
                        extending it right up to the central legion of his line, and had arranged it
                        in such a formation that his left wing was composed of three lines. His
                        motive for doing this was the fact that, whereas his right flank was
                        supported by his fortifications, he was hard put to it to know how his left
                        Hank could bear up under the hordes of enemy cavalry; and it was on this
                        same left flank that he had concentrated the whole of his own cavalry and,
                        not feeling too confident in it, had detached the Fifth legion to support
                        this cavalry, and drafted light-armed troops at intervals among the horse.
                        As for his archers, he had posted them in various formations at definite
                        points throughout the line, but chiefly on the wings. <note type="margin"
                            n="61"/> Such was the manner in which the armies on either side were
                        drawn up, with a distance of no more than three hundred paces separating
                        them—a situation </p>

                    <pb n="241"/>

                    <p> which had never, perhaps, arisen before without leading to an engagement;
                        and there they remained continuously from early morning right until the
                        tenth hour. And now, while Caesar was beginning to lead his army back within
                        his fortifications, suddenly the entire force of cavalry—the more distant
                        one, comprising Numidians and Gaetulians riding without bridles—began a
                        movement on the right and to advance closer to Caesar's camp on the high
                        ground, while Labienus' bridled cavalry maintained their positions and
                        distracted the attention of the legions. Whereupon part of Caesar's cavalry
                        together with the light-armed troops, acting without orders and without
                        discretion, suddenly advanced too far, crossed a marshy tract and found
                        themselves too far outnumbered to be able to contain the enemy. Abandoning
                        the light-armed troops, the cavalry were driven back and fled to their own
                        lines not without casualties—one horseman missing, many horses wounded and
                        twenty-seven light-armed soldiers killed. It was now night when Scipio,
                        delighted with this successful cavalry engagement, withdrew his forces into
                        camp. But in vouchsafing him this triumph the fortunes of war saw fit to
                        make it but short-lived. On the following day, in fact, a detachment of
                        Caesar's cavalry which he had sent to Leptis on a foraging mission surprised
                        in the course of their march and attacked about a hundred marauding Numidian
                        and Gaetulian horse, killing some of them and taking the rest alive.
                        Meanwhile Caesar made it his constant and daily practice to lead his legions
                        down into the plain, proceed with his field-works, carry his rampart and
                        trench across the middle of the plain, and thereby hinder his </p>


                    <pb n="243"/>

                    <p> opponents' sallies. Scipio likewise built counter defences, pushing them
                        forward in haste to prevent Caesar from barring him access to the ridge.
                        Thus the generals on both sides were occupied with field-works, but none the
                        less engaged one another daily in cavalry actions. <note type="margin"
                            n="62"/>Meanwhile Varus, who had previously beached his flotilla at
                        Utica for the winter, learned that the Seventh and Eighth legions were on
                        the way from Sieily. Thereupon he promptly launched his flotilla, manned it
                        on the spot with Gaetnlian oarsmen and marines and, setting sail from Utica.
                        arrived at Hadrumetum with fifty-five ships with the object of setting a
                        trap for them. Caesar, who was unaware of his arrival, despatched L. Cispius
                        with a squadron of twenty-seven ships to the area of Thapsus to patrol there
                        and give cover to his convoy; and he also sent Q. Aquila with thirteen
                        warships to Hadrumetum for the same purpose. Cispius speedily reached his
                        destination, whereas Aquila, lashed by a storm and unable to double the
                        headland, gained a certain cove which was sheltered from the storm and
                        afforded him and his squadron a fairly inconspicuous retreat. The rest of
                        the fleet stood at anchor out at sea off Leptis; and as the crews had
                        disembarked and were roaming here and there about the beach, some of them
                        having gone off to the town to buy themselves food, the fleet had no one to
                        defend it. Learning of this situation from a deserter. Varus seized his
                        opportunity: at the second watch he came out of the inner harbour of
                        Hadrumetum and arrived off Leptis in the early morning with his entire
                        squadron and there he set </p>




                    <pb n="245"/>

                    <p> fire to the defenceless transports which were anchored out at sea at some
                        distance from the port, and captured two five-banked warships, which offered
                        no resistance. <note type="margin" n="63"/> Meanwhile a message speedily
                        acquainted Caesar with the news as he was touring the defence works in his
                        camp, which was six miles distant from the harbour. Putting everything else
                        on one side and giving his horse its head he speedily reached Leptis, where
                        he insisted that all the ships should follow his lead: he himself then went
                        aboard a small cutter. As he sailed on he came up with Aquila, who was
                        filled with panic and confusion at the large number of the enemy ships, and
                        then set off in pursuit of the enemy squadron. Meanwhile Varus, disconcerted
                        by Caesar's promptitude and boldness, had turned about with his entire
                        squadron and was now beating a hasty retreat to Hadrumetum. In four miles'
                        sail Caesar overhauled him, recovered one of his quinqueremes, complete with
                        all its crew, and capturing in addition the enemy prize-crew aboard her, one
                        hundred-and-thirty strong, and then captured the nearest enemy trireme,
                        which in the course of the action had lagged behind the rest, with its full
                        complement of rowers and marines. The rest of the enemy fleet doubled the
                        headland, and one and all sought refuge in the inner harbour of Hadrumetum.
                        But the wind did not hold for Caesar also to be able to double the headland;
                        so after riding out that night at anchor in deep water he approached
                        Hadrumetum at dawn. There he set fire to the transports which were outside
                        the inner harbour and then, as all the others had either been beached by the
                        enemy or massed inside the inner harbour, he waited </p>





                    <pb n="247"/>

                    <p> a little while to see if by chance the enemy were disposed to fight a naval
                        action and then withdrew back to his camp. <note type="margin" n="64"/>
                        Among those made prisoner aboard that trireme was P. Vestrius. a Roman
                        knight, and P. Ligarius, once a supporter of Afranius. Caesar had set the
                        latter free in Spain along with the other Afraniaus,<note type="footnote"
                            n="1" place="opposite">1 After the battle of Ilerda, in August 49 B.

                        after the battle (of Pharsalus), had come to Varus in Africa. In view of his
                        falseness and treachery Caesar bade him be executed. P. Vestrius, on the
                        other hand, he pardoned; for his brother had paid the stipulated ransom at
                        Rome, and Vestrius himself had satisfied Caesar as to the honesty of his
                        motives, explaining that he had been taken prisoner by the fleet of
                        Nasidius, his life had been saved through the kindness of Varus just as he
                        was being led off to execution, and after that he had been given no
                        opportunity of going over to Caesar's side. <note type="margin" n="65"/>
                        There is in Africa a custom among the natives whereby both in the open
                        fields and in practically all their farm buildings they have a secret
                        underground vault for the storage of corn, the main motive for this
                        provision being wars and the sudden appearance of an enemy. When Caesar got
                        to know of this custom through an informer, at the third watch of the night
                        he sent two legions and some cavalry a distance of ten miles from his
                            camp,<note type="footnote" n="2" place="opposite">2 Perhaps S. E. to the
                            fertile district round Moknine.</note> and later saw them return to camp
                        laden with a large quantity of corn. When Labienus learned of this, he
                        advanced seven miles from his camp across the hilly plateau across which
                        Caesar had marched the day before, encamped two legions there and, supposing
                        that Caesar would frequently pass along that same route for foraging </p>

                    <p> purposes, established himself daily at suitable points to lie in wait for
                        him with a large force of cavalry and light-armed troops. <note
                            type="margin" n="66"/>In the meantime information reached Caesar from
                        deserters about Labienus' trap. He waited in camp there a few days for the
                        constant repetition of the same daily routine to lead the enemy into
                        carelessness and then, early one morning, he suddenly gave the order that
                        three veteran legions and a detachment of cavalry should follow him by way
                        of the rear gate. Then, sending on the cavalry ahead, he suddenly surprised
                        the enemy ambush lurking in the ravines, killing some five hundred of their
                        light-armed troops and throwing the rest into a very unseemly rout.
                        Whereupon Labienus dashed up with his entire cavalry force to the relief of
                        his routed troops and as the odds were now too great for the Caesarian horse
                        to contain their powerful onslaught. Caesar displayed to the enemy forces
                        his legions in battle formation. This action utterly daunted and checked
                        Labienus, and Caesar thereupon withdrew his own cavalry without loss. On the
                        following day Juba crucified those Numidians who had quitted their posts and
                        fled back to their camp. <note type="margin" n="67"/> Caesar meanwhile was
                        embarrassed by lack of corn; for which reason he mustered all his forces in
                        camp and, leaving troops to garrison Leptis, Ruspina and Acylla, and
                        assigning his fleet to Cispius and Aquila to maintain the naval blockade,
                        the one of Hadrumetum and the other of Thapsus, he himself set fire to his
                        camp and at the fourth watch of the night in battle formation with his
                        baggage concentrated on the left wing evacuated that position and came to
                        the town of Aggar. This town had pre- </p>




                    <pb n="251"/>

                    <p> viously been repeatedly attacked by the Gaetulians only to be very stoutly
                        defended by the inhabitants themselves. Here in the plain he pitched a
                        single camp and then set off in person with part of his army on a foraging
                        mission round the farmsteads; and finding a large quantity of barley, oil,
                        wine and figs, and a little wheat, he returned to camp with his army duly
                        refreshed. Meanwhile Scipio, who had got to know of Caesar's departure,
                        proceeded to follow him across the plateau with his entire forces and
                        established himself six miles away from Caesar's camp, with his forces
                        divided among three separate camps. <note type="margin" n="68"/> There was a
                        town called Zeta, which was ten miles distant from Scipio but situated in
                        the general direction of his camp; whereas it was relatively distant and
                        remote—fourteen miles in fact—from Caesar.<note type="footnote" n="1"
                            place="opposite">1 The distances given in the MSS.—10 and 14 (or 18, or
                            19) have been much disputed, and editors have amended to suit their own
                            identification of the towns. But the general meaning seems clear—that
                            Zeta lay closer to Scipio. I have adopted Veith's identification of
                            Aggar, Zeta and Tegea.</note> To this town Scipio sent two legions to
                        forage. When Caesar learned of this from a deserter he moved his camp from
                        the plain to a safer position on the high ground; and leaving a covering
                        force there, he himself set out at the fourth watch, marched on past the
                        enemy's camp, and took possession of the town. He then ascertained that
                        Scipio's legions were foraging farther afield: and he was just proceeding to
                        march in their direction when he observed enemy forces hastening up to
                        support those legions. This circumstance made him loath to attack. And so,
                        taking prisoner C. Minucius Reginus, the commandant of that town, who was a
                        Roman knight and a very intimate friend of Scipio. and P. Atrius, a Roman
                        knight and a member of the corporation of Utica, and leading away twenty-two
                        of the king's camels, he proceeded to retire to camp, leaving his
                        lieutenant, Oppius, with a garrison in the town. </p>

                        camp, which of necessity he had to pass, Labienus and Afranius with all
                        their cavalry and light-armed troops sprang up and revealed themselves from
                        behind the nearby hills where they had been lurking in ambush, and flung
                        themselves upon his rearguard. Seeing himself thus attacked. Caesar deployed
                        his cavalry to bear the brunt of the enemy onslaught and ordered his
                        legionaries to pile their packs and promptly deliver a counter-attack. As
                        soon as this was under way the enemy cavalry and light-armed troops were
                        without difficulty driven back and dislodged from the hill directly the
                        legions charged. No sooner had Caesar come to the conclusion that the enemy,
                        beaten back and demoralised as they were, would now stop their harrying, and
                        no sooner had he begun to resume his march, than once again they promptly
                        flung themselves from the cover of the nearby hills and attacked Caesar's
                        legionaries, employing the same tactics as I described above—Numidians and
                        light-armed troops they were, possessed of a marvellous turn of speed,
                        fighting in the ranks of the cavalry and used to keeping pace with the
                        horsemen and doubling forward or retreating at their side. As they repeated
                        this manoeuvre quite frequently, chasing the Julians as they marched and
                        taking to flight when their opponents turned to attack them, and as they
                        would not approach at all close, but employed peculiar tactics and were
                        content with wounding the horses with their javelins, Caesar realised that
                        what they were trying to do was no less than force him to pitch camp at a
                        spot where there was not a drop of water, so that his famished army, which
                        had tasted nothing at all from </p>

                    <pb n="255"/>

                    <p> the fourth watch of the night right up till the tenth hour of the day,
                        should die of thirst—both men and beasts. <note type="margin" n="70"/> It
                        was now nearly sundown and less than a hundred paces had been covered all
                        told in four hours, when Caesar withdrew his cavalry—in view of the
                        casualties among their horses—from the rearguard, and called on the legions
                        to replace them. By employing the legionary troops in this manner and
                        advancing calmly and at a gentle pace he found it less awkward to contain
                        the enemy's violent onslaught. Meanwhile detachments of the Numidian cavalry
                        kept charging ahead along the high ground to his right and left and availing
                        themselves of their superior numbers to surround Caesar's forces with a kind
                        of continuous circle of troops, while others of them pursued his rear-guard.
                        Meanwhile on Caesar's part it needed no more than three or four of his
                        veterans to wheel round and brandish and hurl amain their heavy javelins at
                        the Numidians who menaced them for more than two thousand of the latter to
                        turn tail to a man and then, wheeling their horses round on all sides, they
                        would regroup once more for battle and resume their pursuit at a set
                        distance, hurling their javelins at the legionaries. In this manner, now
                        advancing, now pausing to fight back, Caesar completed his march, albeit
                        somewhat slowly for it was the first hour of the night when he brought all
                        his men back to camp, with not a single man lost and ten wounded. Labienus
                        retired to his lines with roughly three hundred men missing, many wounded,
                        and all his troops exhausted by their continuous offensive. Meanwhile
                        Scipio, who had deployed his legions, with the elephants posted in </p>


                    <pb n="257"/>

                    <p> battle array in front of his camp in full view of Caesar to inspire terror,
                        now led them back to camp. <note type="margin" n="71"/> Faced with an enemy
                        of this kind Caesar proceeded to train his forces, not as a commander trains
                        a veteran army with a magnificent record of victorious achievements, but as
                        a gladiatorial instructor trains his recruits. How many feet they were to
                        retreat from the enemy the manner in which they must wheel round upon their
                        adversary; the restricted space in which they must offer him resistance—now
                        doubling forward, now retiring and making feint attacks; and almost the spot
                        from which, and the manner in which they must discharge their missiles—these
                        were the lessons he taught them. For it was surprising the amount of worry
                        and anxiety the enemy's light-armed troops were causing our army, what with
                        their making the cavalry chary of engaging for fear of losing their mounts,
                        since the light-armed troops kept killing them with their javelins, and with
                        their wearing the legionaries out by their speediness; for no sooner had a
                        heavy-armed soldier, when pursued by them, halted and then made an attack on
                        them than their speed of movement enabled them easily to avoid the danger.
                            <note type="margin" n="72"/> As a result of this Caesar was seriously
                        perturbed, since as often as an engagement had occurred he had been quite
                        unable to be a match with his own cavalry, unsupported by legionary troops,
                        for the enemy cavalry and their light-armed units. Moreover, there was this
                        other problem which worried him: as yet he had had no experience of the
                        enemy legions; and how, he wondered, could he cope with their cavalry and
                        amazing light-armed troops if they </p>

                    <pb n="259"/>

                    <p> were backed up by their legions too. He had yet another cause for
                        anxiety—the panic with which the size and number of the elephants gripped
                        the minds of his soldiers. Here, however, was one problem to which he had
                        found an answer; for he had ordered elephants to be brought across from
                        Italy to enable our troops not only to become familiar with them, but also
                        to get to know both the appearance and capabilities of the beast, what part
                        of its body was readily vulnerable to a missile and, when an elephant was
                        accoutered and armoured, what part of its body was still left uncovered and
                        unprotected, so that their missiles should be aimed at that spot. He had
                        also this further object in mind, that his horses should learn by
                        familiarity with these beasts not to be alarmed by their scent, trumpeting
                        or appearance. From this experiment he had profited handsomely: for the
                        troops handled the beasts and came to appreciate their sluggishness: the
                        cavalry hurled dummy javelins at them; and the docility of the beasts had
                        brought the horses to feel at home with them. <note type="margin" n="73"/>
                        For the reasons above-mentioned Caesar was worried, and his old habitual
                        dashing tactics had now given place to a more sedate and deliberate policy.
                        And no wonder: for the troops he now commanded had been used to fighting in
                        the flat terrain of Gaul against Gauls—men of forthright character with
                        barely a trace of deceit, whose habit it is to rely on valour, not on guile,
                        in their fighting: whereas now he had to perform the arduous task of
                        accustoming his troops to recognise the tricks, traps and stratagems of the
                        enemy, and what tactics could fittingly be adopted, and what avoided.
                        Accordingly, to speed up this training of theirs, he took pains not to </p>


                    <pb n="261"/>

                    <p> keep the legions confined to one area, but to keep them constantly on the
                        move, first to one spot, then to another, ostensibly for foraging purposes,
                        for the very reason that he reckoned the enemy forces would not fail to
                        follow in his tracks. And two days later, when he had led forth his forces
                        duly and carefully deployed, he marched past close to the enemy's camp and
                        challenged them to battle on level ground but when he saw the enemy
                        reluctant to accept, he led his legions back to camp as evening was
                        approaching. <note type="margin" n="74"/> Meanwhile envoys arrived from the
                        town of Vaga, which was near Zeta, the occupation of which by Caesar we have
                        already described. They prayed and besought Caesar to send them a garrison,
                        saying they would assist him by furnishing various supplies useful in war.
                        At this point, by the good will of the gods and their favour towards Caesar,
                        a deserter informed his compatriots that king Juba had speedily hastened to
                        the town with his forces to forestall the arrival there of Caesar's garrison
                        that at his coming he had surrounded the town with vast forces, won control
                        of it, slaughtered all the inhabitants to a man, and then given it over to
                        his troops to plunder and destroy. <note type="margin" n="75"/> Meanwhile
                        Caesar ceremonially purified his army on March 21st. On the following day he
                        led forth his entire forces, advanced five miles from his own camp, and took
                        his stand in battle array at a distance of some two miles from Scipio's
                        camp. On perceiving that his opponents, despite this adequate and sustained
                        challenge, declined his offer of battle, he led his forces back: and on the
                        following day he struck camp and took the road to the town of Sarsura, where
                        Scipio had posted a garrison of </p>

                    <pb n="263"/>

                    <p> Numidians and laid in a stock of corn. When Labienus perceived this he
                        proceeded to harry Caesar's rear-guard with his cavalry and light-armed
                        troops; and having by this means cut off the baggage trains of the sutlers
                        and merchants who were carrying their wares in carts, he was thereby the
                        more encouraged to grow bolder and come closer to the legions, since he
                        supposed that the soldiers were worn out with carrying their heavy packs and
                        so in no condition to fight. But this contingency had not escaped Caesar's
                        attention: he had in fact given instructions that three hundred men out of
                        each legion should be in light order; and these he accordingly despatched
                        against Labienus' cavalry to give support to his own squadrons. Whereupon
                        Labienus, dismayed at the sight of the standards, wheeled round his horses
                        and beat a hasty and highly undignified retreat. The legionary troops,
                        having killed many of his men and wounded not a few, retired to their
                        standards and proceeded to resume their march. Labienus still kept up his
                        pursuit at a distance, moving along the crest of the ridge of hills upon the
                        right. <note type="margin" n="76"/> When Caesar came to the town of Sarsura
                        he massacred Scipio's garrison while his opponents looked on, not daring to
                        assist their friends. Its commander, however, P. Cornelius, a reservist
                        recalled by Scipio, offered a gallant resistance, but was surrounded by
                        overwhelming numbers and killed. Then Caesar gained control of the town,
                        distributed corn to his army on the spot, and arrived next day at the town
                        of Thysdra. Considius was in the town at this time with a considerable
                        garrison force and his own bodyguard of gladiators. Caesar </p>




                    <pb n="265"/>

                    <p> studied the characteristics of the town, and the lack of water discouraged
                        him from attacking it: he then set out forthwith and pitched a camp some
                        four miles away near water, only to quit it at the fourth watch and return
                        once again to the camp he had occupied near Aggar. Scipio followed suit and
                        led his forces back to his old camp. <note type="margin" n="77"/> Meanwhile
                        the inhabitants of Thabena,<note type="footnote" n="1" place="opposite">1

                            mentioned by Strabo and located by some editors far south, opposite the
                            islands of Cercina, seems dubious.</note> who dwelt on the coast at the
                        extreme verge of Juba's kingdom and were his traditional lieges and
                        subjects, had none the less massacred the royal garrison, and now sent
                        envoys to Caesar informing him of their action and earnestly soliciting that
                        the Roman people should give them succour in their present plight, as they
                        had deserved well at their hands. Caesar approved their policy and sent
                        Marcius Crispus with three cohorts and numerous archers and pieces of
                        artillery to Thabena as a garrison force. It was at this same time that
                        Caesar was reinforced by the troops from all his legions who, whether
                        prevented by sickness or because they had been granted leave, had previously
                        been unable to cross to Africa with the colours: these comprised about four
                        thousand infantry, four hundred cavalry and a thousand slingers and archers,
                        and all came in one convoy. And so, leading out all his legions, including
                        these forces, he took up a position in battle array in the plain five miles
                        away from his own camp and two miles distant from Scipio's. <note
                            type="margin" n="78"/> Below Scipio's camp there was a town called
                        Tegea, where he kept a standing garrison force of cavalry numbering some two
                        thousand men. This cavalry he now deployed in line on the right- and
                        left-hand flanks of the town, while he himself led his </p>

                    <pb n="267"/>

                    <p> legions out of camp and after advancing not much more than about a mile from
                        his defences drew them up arrayed in battle formation on the lower slopes of
                        a ridge. After some little time had elapsed without Scipio's shifting his
                        position, and as the daylight hours were being frittered away in inaction,
                        Caesar ordered some squadrons of his own horse to make a charge against the
                        enemy cavalry which were posted on guard near the town, and despatched some
                        light-armed units, archers and slingers to the same objective in support.
                        When this manoeuvre was under way and the Julians had delivered their attack
                        at full gallop, Pacideius began to deploy his horsemen on a broader front,
                        to enable them to swarm round the flanks of the Julian cavalry and still
                        fight with the utmost gallantry and spirit. When Caesar observed these
                        tactics he instructed the three hundred men in light order—-it was his
                        normal practice that this number of men in each of his legions should be in
                        light order—from the legion which was posted in the line nearest the seene
                        of this action to hasten to the assistance of the cavalry. Meanwhile
                        Labienus sent cavalry reinforcements to support his own horsemen, furnishing
                        unscathed troopers and those whose strength was relatively unspent to take
                        the place of their wounded or exhausted comrades. Now that the four hundred
                        Julian cavalry were finding it impossible to contain the violent onslaught
                        of an enemy some four thousand strong, and were suffering casualties at the
                        hands of the light-armed Numidians and giving ground very slightly, Caesar
                        despatched a second wing of cavalry to dash speedily to the help of his
                        hard-pressed men. This action raised the spirits of his troops, who
                        delivered a massed charge against the </p>

                    <p> enemy and turned their opponents to flight; and after killing many and
                        wounding not a few and chasing the enemy for three miles and driving them
                        right up to the high ground they retired to their lines. Caesar waited till

                        <note type="margin" n="80"/> There was a lagoon of salt water, separated
                        from the sea by a certain narrow strip of land not more than a mile and a
                        half wide: and this corridor Scipio now attempted to enter to bring help to
                        the men of Thapsus. The likelihood of such a move had not escaped Caesar's
                        attention: in fact, the day before he had built a fort at this spot and left
                        behind a force of three cohorts to hold it. while he himself with the rest
                        of his forces established a crescent-shaped camp and invested Thapsus with a
                        ring of siege works. Meanwhile Scipio, foiled in his undertaking, bypassed
                        the lagoon to the north by a march which he completed in the ensuing day and
                            night,<note type="footnote" n="1" place="opposite">1 Apparently he
                            marched round its western side. The words postero die et note have been
                            variously explained and amended. Seipio's abortive attempt to penetrate
                            the eastern corridor was made, as pridie shews, on April 5th: postero
                            die is, I think, relative to pridie (April 4th) and denotes the

                            involved—perhaps some eighteen hours is certainly long for the distance
                            of about 20 miles; but, as R. Holmes has pointed out. Scipio may well
                            have rested en route and timed his march so as to begin his
                            entrenchments under cover of darkness.</note> and then, at the first

                            type="margin" n="81"/> When Caesar arrived there and observed Scipio's
                        battle line arrayed in front of the rampart, with the elephants posted on
                        the right and left wings, while none the less part of his troops were busily
                        engaged in fortifying the. camp, he himself disposed his army in three
                        lines: the Tenth and Seventh legions he posted on the right wing, the Eighth
                        and Ninth on the left, while five cohorts of the Fifth legion were stationed
                        on each of the actual wings, forming a fourth line to contain the elephants
                        and his archers and slingers were deployed on either wing, and the
                        light-armed units interspersed among the cavalry. Caesar himself hurriedly
                        went the rounds of his troops on foot, reminding the veterans of their
                        gallant bearing in previous combats and raising their morale by flattering
                        appeals. As for tin recruits, seeing they had never so far fought in pitched
                        battle, he urged them to emulate the gallantry of the veterans and to make
                        it their ambition by gaining a victory to enjoy a fame, status and renown
                        equal to theirs. <note type="margin" n="82"/> Now in the course of making
                        these rounds of his army he observed that the enemy in the neighbourhood of
                        their rampart were excited, rushing hither and thither in alarm, now
                        retiring inside the gates, now trooping out in a spasmodic and undisciplined
                        fashion. Several others were beginning to observe the same symptoms when

                        signal, saying that it was decisive victory that the immortal gods were thus
                        foretelling them. Caesar still hesitated, opposing their impetuous
                        eagerness, repeated 1 y protesting that a precipitate sally was not his
                        approved way of fighting, and again and again holding his battle line in
                        check; when suddenly on the right wing, without orders from Caesar but under
                        coercion of the troops, a trumpeter began to sound the charge. Whereupon
                        even- single cohort began to attack the enemy, despite the resistance of the
                        centurions, who planted themselves in the path of the troops and sought to
                        hold them back by force to prevent their attacking without orders from the
                        commander-in-chief, but all in vain. <note type="margin" n="83"/> When
                        Caesar realised that it was quite out of the question to hold back his
                        troops in their present state of excitement, he signalled ' Good Luck ' and
                        giving his horse its head rode in hot haste against the enemy front ranks.
                        Meanwhile on the right wing the slingers and archers in crowds launched
                        rapid volleys of missiles against the elephants. Whereupon the beasts,
                        terrified by the whizzing sound of the slings and by the stones and leaden
                        bullets launched against them, speedily wheeled round. trampled under foot
                        the massed and serried ranks of their own supporting troops behind them, and
                        rushed towards the half-completed gates of the rampart. The Moorish cavalry.
                        who were posted on the same wing as the elephants, followed suit and,
                        abandoned by their protective screen, started the rout. Having thus speedily
                        got round the elephants, the legions gained possession of the enemy's

                        killed, the remainder precipitately sought refuge in the camp from which
                        they had issued the day before. <note type="margin" n="84"/> I ought not, I
                        think, to omit to mention the gallantry of a veteran soldier of the Fifth
                        legion. On the left wing an elephant, maddened by the pain of a wound it had
                        received, had attacked an unarmed sutler, pinned him underfoot, and then
                        knelt upon him and now. with its trunk ereet and swaying, and trumpeting
                        loudly, it was crushing him to death with its weight. This was more than the
                        soldier could bear he could not but confront the beast, fully armed as he
                        was. When it observed him coming towards it with weapon poised to strike,
                        the elephant abandoned the corpse, encircled the soldier with its trunk, and
                        lifted him up in the air. The soldier, perceiving that a dangerous crisis of
                        this sort demanded resolute action on his part, hewed with his sword again
                        and again at the encircling trunk with all the strength he could muster. The
                        resulting pain caused the elephant to drop the soldier, wheel round, and
                        with shrill trumpetings make all speed to rejoin its fellows. <note
                            type="margin" n="85"/> Meanwhile the members of the garrison of Thapsus
                        made a sortie from the town by way of the seaward gate and, whether their
                        object was to hasten to the aid of their fellows, or to abandon the town and
                        secure their own safety by flight, out they came and accordingly, wading
                        waist-high into the sea, made for the land. They were, however, prevented
                        from reaching land by stones and heavy javelins hurled by the slaves and
                        lackeys in the camp: <note type="footnote" n="1" place="opposite">1 It would

                        back into the town. Meanwhile Scipio's forces, now </p>


                    <pb n="279"/>

                    <p> thrown into utter confusion, were in wholesale retreat in every sector of
                        the field, and Caesar's legions promptly pursued them without giving them
                        any respite in which to pull themselves together. When the fugitives reached
                        the camp they were making for, with the objeet of making a recovery there
                        and defending themselves once more, and of trying to find someone to lead
                        them—someone to look up to, under whose authority and command they could
                        carry on the tight; when they got there and perceived that there was nobody
                        guarding it, they forthwith discarded their armour and beat a hasty retreat
                        to the royal camp. This too on their arrival they saw to be in the hands of
                        the Julians. Abandoning all hope of salvation, they now halted on a hill and
                        gave the military salute by lowering their arms. This gesture, unhappily for
                        them, stood them in but little stead. For Caesar's veterans were filled with
                        such burning indignation and resentment that, so far from any possibility of
                        inducing them to spare the enemy, they actually wounded or killed several
                        men of culture and distinction among the ranks of their own side, calling
                        them ringleaders. Among these was Tullius Rufus, an ex-quaestor, who was
                        mortally wounded by a soldier who deliberately ran him through with a heavy
                        javelin; and similarly Pompeius Rufus was stabbed in the arm with a sword
                        and would have been done to death, had he not promptly rushed to Caesar's
                        side. This behaviour caused grave alarm among quite a number of Roman
                        knights and senators, who retired from the battle lest they themselves
                        should also be massacred by the soldiers, who after so resounding a victory
                        had apparently taken it for granted that they were free to perpetrate </p>

                    <p> any excesses, on the assumption that they would go unpunished in view of
                        their magnificent achievements. Accordingly, although all these troops of
                        Scipio implored Caesar's protection, they were massacred to a man, despite
                        the fact that Caesar himself was looking on and entreating his troops to
                        spare them. <note type="margin" n="86"/> Having made himself master of three
                        camps and killed ten thousand of the enemy and routed a large number, Caesar
                        retired to camp with fifty soldiers missing and a few wounded. Immediately
                        on his arrival he established himself in front of the town of Thapsus. He
                        then took sixty-four elephants, equipped, armed and complete with towers and
                        harness, and these he now drew up in array in front of the town: his object
                        in so doing was to see if Vergilius and the others who were being besieged
                        with him could be induced to abandon their obstinate resistance by the
                        evidence of their comrades' failure. He then addressed a personal appeal to
                        Vergilius inviting him to surrender and reminding him of his own leniency
                        and clemency: but on failing to observe any response he withdrew from the
                        town. On the following day, after offering sacrifice, he held a parade and
                        in full view of the occupants of the town congratulated his troops,
                        rewarding his entire veteran force and bestowing decorations publicly in
                        front of the dais for conspicuous gallantry and meritorious service.
                        Thereupon he immediately withdrew from the town, leaving behind the

                        with two at Thysdra, where Considius was in command, to continue the
                        blockades of these places: and then, </p>

                    <p> sending M. Messalla on ahead to Utica with the cavalry, he himself also
                        proceeded with despatch to the same destination. <note type="margin" n="87"
                        /> Meanwhile those horsemen of Scipio's who had escaped from the battle were
                        proceeding in the direction of Utica when they came to the town of Parada.
                        Being refused admittance by the inhabitants—for the tidings of Caesar's
                        victory had preceded them—they gained possession of the town by force; then,
                        making a pile of faggots in the middle of the market-place and heaping on
                        top all the inhabitants' possessions, they set fire to it and then flung
                        into the flames, alive and bound, the inhabitants of the town themselves,
                        irrespective of rank or age, thereby meting out to them the most cruel of
                        all punishments. Whereupon they came straight to Utica. Now earlier on M.
                        Cato had come to the conclusion that on account of the benefit they had
                        received from the Julian law<note type="footnote" n="1" place="opposite">1
                            Nothing is known of the details of this law, passed in his consulship in
                            59 B. C., as affecting the citizens of Utica.</note> the men of Utica
                        were but lukewarm supporters of his cause and so he had expelled the unarmed
                        mob from the town, built a concentration camp in front of the military gate,
                        protected by quite a shallowish trench, and forced them to live there
                        cordoned off by sentries. As for the town's senate, he kept it under
                        restraint. This concentration camp of theirs Scipio's horsemen now attacked
                        and began to storm, for the very reason that they knew that its occupants
                        had been adherents of Caesar's side: and if they massacred them their
                        destruction might serve to avenge their own sense of disappointment. But the
                        people of Utica, emboldened as a result of Caesar's victory, drove back the
                        horsemen with stones and clubs. And so, finding it impossible to gain
                        possession of the camp, the </p>

                    <p> horsemen hurled themselves upon the town of Utica, where they massacred many
                        of the inhabitants and stormed and looted their houses. As Cato could not
                        persuade them by any means to join him in defending the town or cease from
                        their butchery and pillaging, and as he was aware of their intentions, he
                        distributed a hundred sestcrees to each of them by way of appeasing their
                        wanton attitude. Faustus Sulla followed suit and bribed them out of his own
                        pocket; he then left Utica with them and proceeded on his way to Juba's
                        kingdom. <note type="margin" n="88"/> Meanwhile a considerable number of the
                        fugitives reached Utica. All these, together with the Three Hundred,<note

                        had contributed money to Scipio for the prosecution of the war. Scipio now
                        called together and urged them to set their slaves at liberty and defend the
                        town. On perceiving that, while some of them agreed with him, others were
                        thoroughly scared at heart and had set their minds on flight, he refrained
                        from further mention of the subject and assigned ships to the latter to
                        enable them to leave for the destination of their individual choice. As for
                        himself, having made all arrangements with the greatest care and entrusted
                        his children to L. Caesar, who at the time was acting as his quaestor, he
                        retired to bed without arousing any suspicions, there being nothing unusual
                        either about the way he looked or the way he talked: and then, having
                        secretly smuggled a dagger into his bedroom, he accordingly stabbed himself.
                        He had collapsed but was still breathing when his doctor and some members of
                        his household, suspecting something amiss, forced their way into the bedroom
                        and proceeded to staunch and bind up the wound; but with his own hands he </p>

                        Despite, their hatred of him on party grounds, yet, on account of his unique
                        integrity, and because he had proved so very different from the other
                        leaders and had fortified Utica with wonderful defences and extended its
                        battlements, the men of Utica accorded him burial. After Cato's suicide L.
                        Caesar, intending to turn this incident somehow to his personal advantage,
                        delivered a speech to the assembled people in which he urged them all to
                        open their gates, saying that he set great store by C. Caesar's clemency.
                        Accordingly, the gates were thrown open and he came out from Utica and set
                        forth to meet Caesar, the commander-in-chief. Messalla arrived at Utica in
                        accordance with his instructions and posted guards at all the gates. <note
                            type="margin" n="89"/> Caesar meanwhile advanced from Thapsus and
                        arrived at Usseta, where Scipio had kept a large quantity of stores
                        including, amongst other things, corn, arms and weapons: there was also a
                        small garrison force. Of this arsenal he gained possession on his arrival,
                        and then came to Hadrumetum. Entering this town without opposition, he made
                        an inventory of the arms, corn and money in it, and spared the lives of Q.
                        Ligarius and C. Considius, the son, both of whom were present at that time.
                        Then, quitting Hadrumetum the same day and leaving Livineius Regulus behind
                        there with a legion he hastened on to Utica. On the way he was met by L.
                        Caesar, who incontinently threw himself at his feet and prayed him for one
                        boon, for one alone—to spare him his life. Caesar readily granted him this
                        boon—an act which accorded both with his natural temperament and principles
                        and in the same way </p>


                    <pb n="289"/>

                    <p> he followed his normal procedure in sparing the lives of Caeeina, C. Ateius,
                        P. Attius, L. Cella (both father and son), M. Eppius, M. Aquinus, as well as
                        Cato's son and the children of Damasippus. He then arrived at Utica when it
                        was just about dusk and spent that night outside the town. <note
                            type="margin" n="90"/> Early the following morning he entered the town
                        and summoned an assembly, at which he addressed the citizens of Utica in a
                        stirring speech and thanked them for the zealous support they had given him.
                        As, however, for the Roman citizens who were engaged in trade and those
                        members of the Three Hundred who had contributed sums of money to Varus and
                        Scipio, he brought a very detailed accusation against them and dilated at
                        some length upon their crimes, but finally announced that they could come
                        out into the open without fear: their lives at any rate he would spare:
                        their property indeed he would sell, yet on the following condition, that if
                        any man among them personally bought in his own property, he himself would
                        duly register the sale of the property and enter up the money paid under the
                        heading of a fine, so as to enable the man in question to enjoy full
                        security thereafter. For these men, pale with fear and, considering their
                        deserts, with little hope of saving their lives, here was an unexpected
                        offer of salvation. Gladly and eagerly they accepted the terms and besought
                        Caesar to fix a lump sum of money to be paid by the entire Three Hundred as
                        a whole. Accordingly, he required them to pay to the Roman people the sum of
                        two hundred million sesterces in six instalments spread over three years;
                        and this they accepted gladly and without a single murmur, expressing their
                        gratitude to </p>

                    <pb n="291"/>

                    <p> Caesar and declaring that this day finally marked for them the start of a
                        new life. <note type="margin" n="91"/> Meanwhile king Juba had fled from the
                        battle and, accompanied by Petreius, by lying up in farms by day and
                        travelling by night, arrived at length in his kingdom and came to the town
                        of Zama. In this town he had his own residence and his wives and children;
                        and it was here he had collected all his money and most precious possessions
                        from all over his kingdom, having fortified the town at the outset of
                        hostilities with very strong defences. But the townsfolk, who had already
                        heard the much-desired tidings of Caesar's victory, refused him admittance
                        on the following grounds: when he entered upon hostilities with the Roman
                        people he had collected a mass of wooden billets and built a vast pyre in
                        the town of Zama in the middle of the market-place, so that, should it so
                        chance he was beaten in the war, he might pile all his possessions on it,
                        then massacre all his citizens and fling them also on to it, set it alight,
                        and then finally slay himself on top of it, and thus be consumed by fire
                        along with his children, wives, citizens and the entire royal treasure. For
                        a long time Juba earnestly treated with the men of Zama before the gates of
                        the town, employing threats in the first place, as his authority warranted;
                        secondly, realising that he was making but little headway, he besought them
                        with entreaties to let him have access to his own hearth and home; and
                        thirdly, when he observed that they persisted in their determination, and
                        that neither threats nor entreaties on his part had any effect upon them or
                        disposed them the more to admit him, he begged them to hand over to him his
                        wives and children, so </p>

                    <pb n="293"/>

                    <p> that he could carry them away with him. On observing that the townsfolk
                        vouchsafed him no answer at all he left Zama without gaining any
                        satisfaction from them, and then betook himself to a country residence of
                        his, attended by M. Petieius and a few horsemen. <note type="margin" n="92"
                        />Whereupon the men of Zama sent envoys to Caesar at Utica to discuss this
                        situation, asking him to send them help before the king should collect a
                        force and attack them: at all events, they said, they were prepared to
                        preserve the town and themselves for him so long as the breath of life
                        remained in them. Caesar congratulated the envoys and bade them return home:
                        he would follow them, and they must make known his coming in advance. He
                        himself left Utica the following day with his cavalry and proceeded with
                        despatch into the royal territory. Meanwhile in the course of his march
                        there came to Caesar several leaders of the royal forces, who begged him to
                        forgive them. To these suppliants he granted pardon, and then came to Zama.
                        Meanwhile the tidings of his leniency and clemency had spread abroad, with
                        the result that practically all the horsemen in the kingdom came to Caesar
                        at Zama and there they were set free by him from their fears and the danger
                        winch involved them. <note type="margin" n="93"/> During the course of these
                        proceedings on either side Considius, who was in command at Thysdra and was
                        accompanied by his household slaves, a bodyguard of gladiators and some
                        Gaetulians, learned of the massacre of his comrades; and being seriously
                        perturbed by the arrival of Domitius and his legions, and despairing of
                        saving his life, he abandoned the town, made a secret withdrawal with a
                        handful of his </p>


                    <pb n="295"/>

                    <p> foreign troops and a large sum of money, and beat a hasty retreat to Juba's
                        kingdom. But while he was on the road the Gaetulians who bore him company
                        cut him down in their impatience to loot his treasure, and then made off, as
                        best they could, in various directions. Meanwhile C. Vergilius. who was cut
                        off alike by land and sea. perceived that he was making no progress: that
                        his comrades were either killed or put to flight: that M. Cato had taken his
                        own life at Utica: that the king was a wanderer at large, abandoned by his
                        subjects and held in universal contempt: that Saburra and his troops had
                        been destroyed by Sittius: that Caesar had been received without opposition
                        at Utica; and that out of all that vast army there was nothing left
                        whatever. For his own part, therefore, he accepted the safeguard for himself
                        and his children offered him by the pro-consul Caninius, who was blockading
                        him, and surrendered himself to the latter with all his effects and the
                        town. <note type="margin" n="94"/>. Meanwhile king Juba, outlawed by all his
                        townships, despaired of saving his life. And so finally, after dining with
                        Petreius, he fought a duel with him with swords, so as to create the
                        impression that both had met a gallant death; and the sword of the stronger
                        man, Juba, easily put an end to Petreius, his weaker adversary. Juba then
                        endeavoured to run himself through the chest with his sword; but not being
                        able to do it, he successfully entreated a slave of his to kill him, and so
                        achieved his purpose. <note type="margin" n="95"/> Meanwhile P. Sittius had
                        routed the army of Saburra, Juba's lieutenant, killing Saburra himself, and
                        was marching with a small force through Mauretania to join Caesar when he
                        happened to fall </p>


                    <pb n="297"/>

                    <p> in with Faustus and Afranius, who were in command of the party—some thousand
                        strong—with which they had plundered Utica, and were now making tracks for
                        Spain. And so he promptly laid an ambush by night and attacked them at dawn.
                        A few of the cavalry in their vanguard escaped; but all the rest were either
                        killed or else they surrendered, and Sittius captured alive Afranius as well
                        as Faustus with his wife and children. A few days later some disagreement
                        arose in the army and Faustus and Afranius were killed. As for Pompeia and
                        the children of Faustus, Caesar spared their lives and allowed them to
                        retain all their property. <note type="margin" n="96"/> Meanwhile Scipio,
                        Damasippus, Torquatus and Plaetorius Rustianus were making for Spain aboard
                        some warships; and after a long and very stormy passage they were carried
                        towards Royal Hippo, where P. Sittius had his fleet at that time.
                        Outnumbered as they were by the latter, Scipio's vessels were surrounded and
                        sunk; and Scipio and those I have just named perished aboard them. <note
                            type="margin" n="97"/> Meanwhile at Zama Caesar held an auction of the
                        royal property and sold the goods of those who, albeit Roman citizens, had
                        borne arms against the Roman people. He bestowed rewards upon the
                        inhabitants of Zama, who had adopted the policy of barring their gates to
                        the king, farmed out the collection of the royal taxes, and turned the
                        kingdom into a province. Then, leaving C. Sallustius behind there in
                        military command with the powers of proconsul, he himself left Zama and
                        returned to Utica. There he sold the property of those who had held military
                        commands under Juba and Petreius, and exacted the following payments under
                        the title of </p>

                        corporation—three million likewise from the men of Hadrumetum—three million
                        and from their corporation—five million. But he protected their cities and
                        property from all injury and looting. As for the inhabitants of Leptis,
                        whose property had been plundered in former years by Juba but had been
                        restored to them after the Senate had appointed arbitrators on receiving a
                        deputation of theirs lodging a formal complaint, Caesar now required them to
                        pay by way of fine three million pounds weight of oil annually, because at

                        they had entered into an alliance with Juba, and had assisted him with arms,
                        troops and money. The men of Thysdra—not a well-to-do community—were fined a
                        certain quantity of corn. <note type="margin" n="98"/> After making these
                        arrangements he went aboard his fleet at Utica on June 13th, and arrived two
                        days later at Caralis in Sardinia. There he fined the men of Sulei one
                        hundred thousand sesterces for having harboured Nasidius and his fleet and
                        assisted him by supplying troops, and directed that they should pay as tax
                        one-eighth of their produce instead of one-tenth. He also sold up the
                        property of a few individuals. Then he embarked on June 27th, and leaving
                        Caralis, sailed along the coast. Twenty-seven days later—for bad weather
                        kept holding him up in the various ports—he arrived at the city of Rome.

                        to throw himself upon the protection of each individual state. Having in

                        violent measures, he was now playing havoc with the province. In these
                        circumstances some states sent reinforcements of their own accord, while on
                        the other hand some shut their gates against him. And if, whenever he took

                        requesting assistance to be sent to them. <note type="margin" n="2"/> C.
                        Caesar, who was now in his third dictatorship and had been appointed to a
                        fourth, had had much business to complete before he took to the road but
                        this was now disposed of, and he had come post haste to Spain to finish off
                        the war. Envoys from those in Corduba who had deserted the cause of Cn.
                        Pompeius had met Caesar and now reported that the town of Corduba could be
                        captured by night, because it was by surprise that Pompeius had mastered his
                        rivals in that province, and moreover, Pompeius himself had revealed his own
                        fears of Caesar's arrival by the fact that he had posted couriers at all
                        points to notify him of Caesar's coming. They also advanced many other
                        plausible reasons besides this. Caesar was thereby encouraged and informed
                        Q. Pedius and Q. Fabius Maximus, the two officers he had previously
                        appointed to command his army, that he had arrived, adding instructions that
                        the cavalry which had been raised in the province should support him. Rut he
                        came up with them more expeditiously than they themselves anticipated, and
                        so did not have the cavalry to support him as he himself had wished. <note

                        Pompeius, who was holding Corduba with a garrison force, that town being
                        regarded as the capital of the province; whereas the young Cn. Pompeius
                        himself was attacking the town of Ulia, and had now been engaged there for
                        some months or so. On learning </p>

                        the earliest opportunity. Caesar, who was aware that the township in
                        question had always deserved well of the Roman people, promptly gave orders
                        that six infantry cohorts and a corresponding number of cavalry should set
                        out at the second watch and in command of them he put L. Vibius Paeiaeeus, a
                        well-known member of that province, and one that knew it pretty well.<note

                        Pompeius' outposts he was beset by bad weather and a violent gale. So severe
                        was the storm and so dark did it make the approaches to the town that they
                        could scarcely recognise their next-door neighbours. To them indeed this
                        drawback proved of the utmost .advantage. And so, when they had got thus
                        far, he bade the horsemen go up in file,<note type="footnote" n="2"
                            place="opposite">2 Or possibly—' bade the infantry mount pillion '. The
                            subsequent rapid advance, as well as the mention of the cavalry's being
                            numerically equal to the infantry, tends, I rather think, to support
                            this interpretation. It would, however, fit much better in the next
                            chapter, where the infantry undoubtedly took to the horses for a time.

                            the two sorties, and attributed somewhat allusively to both the tactics

                        forward to the town straight through their opponent's positions. When they
                        were in the middle of their positions someone asked who they were and one of
                        our men told the questioner to hold his tongue: 'just at the moment they
                        were trying to come up to the wall so as to capture the town.' It was in
                        fact partly the disconcerting effect of this reply, partly the difficulties
                        of the storm, which prevented the sentries from displaying proper attention
                        to their duties. When they came up to the gate they gave the pass-word and
                        were admitted by the townsfolk: the infantry were deployed in various
                        sectors of the town and </p>

                    <p> stayed inside, while the cavalry raised a shout and sallied forth against
                        the enemy camp. Thus, in the course of this operation, which had taken the
                        enemy unawares, well nigh the majority of the troops in this camp thought
                        they were as good as captured. <note type="margin" n="4"/> Having despatched
                        this relief force to Ulia, Caesar marched to Corduba with the object of
                        inducing Pompeius to abandon his assault of Ulia; and while on the march he
                        sent on ahead some heavy-armed infantry troops—brave soldiers—accompanied by
                        cavalry. No sooner had they come within sight of the town than they all took
                        to the horses; but this manoeuvre it was quite impossible for the men of
                        Corduba to observe. Now as they were approaching Corduba. a good large force
                        came out of the town to cut the cavalry to pieces, and the heavy-armed
                        infantry we have just mentioned now dismounted. They then fought a great
                        battle, to such effect that out of that countless host but few men retired
                        back into the town. In his alarm at this reverse Sextus Pompeius was
                        constrained to send a despatch to his brother urging him to come promptly to
                        his aid, to prevent Caesar's capturing Corduba before Gnaeus himself could
                        arrive there. Accordingly, though Cn. Pompeius had almost captured Ulia, he
                        was disturbed by his brother's despatch and proceeded to march to Corduba
                        with his forces. <note type="margin" n="5"/> When Caesar came to the river
                        Baetis he could not cross it owing to the depth of the stream so he lowered
                        into it wicker baskets filled with stones, laid beams on top of them, and
                        thus made a bridge, by which he brought his forces across to a camp divided
                        into three sections. He was now encamped over against the town in the area
                        of the bridge, and </p>



                    <pb n="319"/>

                    <p> his camp was. as we have just mentioned, divided into three sections. When
                        Pompeius arrived there with his forces he pitched a camp on the same
                        principle on the opposite side. In order to cut him off from the town and
                        the supplies it afforded, Caesar began to carry a line of fortifications to
                        the bridge,<note type="footnote" n="1" place="opposite">1 viz. the permanent
                            bridge over the Baetis (Guadalquivir), the northern end of which must
                            have been in the hands of Sextus: Caesar's object was to deny its use to
                            Gnaeus. Caesar's line presumably ran from his own bridgehead at the
                            southern end of his pile bridge to the southern end of the permanent
                            bridge: Gnaeus' line must have been a contravallation.</note> and
                        Pompeius adopted tactics on similar lines. Whereupon a race took place
                        between the two commanders as to which of them should seize the bridge first
                        and this race gave rise to daily skirmishes on a small scale in which now
                        our troops, now theirs, would come out on top. This situation had now
                        developed into a more intensive struggle, and both sides being more
                        passionately bent on holding their ground had embarked upon hand-to-hand
                        fighting and formed a solid mass near the bridge and as they approached the
                        river's banks they were flung headlong into it, packed tightly as they were.
                        At this point the two sides vied with each other not merely in piling one
                        death upon another but in matching mound of dead with mound.<note

                            likely that the purpose of the whole sentence is merely to emphasise the
                            extent of the carnage, the tumuli are probably the burial mounds, or
                            possibly the piles of corpses. The elaborate balance of expression
                            suggests, I think, that tumulos tumulis are the rival barrows. Klotz,
                            however, interprets the latter phrase as meaning ' they made the barrows
                            to look like hills.'</note> Several days were passed in this fashion,
                        and Caesar was anxious to bring his opponents down to favourable ground, if
                        by any means he could do so, and fight a decisive action at the earliest
                        opportunity. <note type="margin" n="6"/> Observing that his opponents were
                        by no means willing to do this, Caesar led his forces across the river and
                        ordered large fires to be lit at night, so as </p>

                    <p> to entice them into the plain just as he had drawn them away from Ulia; and
                        in this manner he set out for Ategua, the strongest garrison of Pompeius.
                        When Pompeius got to know of this from deserters, on the first day that
                        afforded him the opportunity he quitted the mountain passes and retired to
                        Corduba with a numerous train of carts and laden mules.<note type="footnote"
                            n="1">1 See Appendix B, p. 397.</note> Caesar began to assault Ategua by
                        surrounding it with siege works and fortified lines. Now a message had been
                        brought to him concerning Pompeius to the effect that he was setting out
                        that day: and by way of safeguarding himself against Pompeius' coming Caesar
                        had occupied several forts where in some cases cavalry, in others infantry
                        forces could be posted as outlying pickets and sentries to protect his camp:
                        yet, in these circumstances, it so chanced that when Pompeius did arrive
                        there was a very thick mist in the early morning. And so in the resulting
                        gloom the Pompeians surrounded Caesar's cavalry with a number of infantry
                        cohorts and squadrons of horse, and cut them up so severely that but few men
                        barely managed to escape that massacre. <note type="margin" n="7"/> The
                        following night Pompeius burned his camp and. passing through the valleys on

                        Ategua and Ueubi. Meanwhile Caesar had completed his emplacements and all
                        his other dispositions which were required for assaulting the town, and
                        proceeded to carry forward a ramp furnished with mantlets. Now this area is

                            and Dii Pontet.</note> It was in this direction, namely that of Ategua.
                        that Pompeius had his camp pitched in the mountains in sight of both towns,
                        without, however, venturing to come to the aid of his comrades. He had the
                        eagles and standards of thirteen legions: but among those which he thought
                        afforded him any solid support two were native legions, having deserted from
                        Trebonius; a third had been raised from the local Roman settlers; a fourth
                        was one which was once commanded by Afranius and which Pompeius had brought
                        with him from Africa <note type="footnote" n="2" place="opposite">2 It seems
                            very difficult to identify these four reliable legions with any
                            certainty. The only Pompeian legions definitely named in the narrative
                            are:—the First (ch. 18); the Second (ch. 13); and the Thirteenth (ch.
                            34). From Bell. Alex. chs. 50-54 it is clear that Cassius, whom
                            Trebonius succeeded as governor of Further Spain, had five legions: the
                            Twenty-first and the Thirtieth (raised in Italy); the Second (long
                            quartered in .Spain); the 'native legion' (always thus named); and the
                            Fifth (newly raised in Spain by Cassius himself). Of these the Second,
                            Fifth and the native legion joined the mutiny against Cassius, and
                            shewed Pom-<pb n="323"/>peian sympathies; for which reason it would not
                            seem surprising if they were opposing Caesar now. Holmes was satisfied
                            that the other of the two native legions here mentioned was the Fifth;
                            but he assumed, without accounting for the reference in ch. 13, that the
                            Second had now joined Caesar. Klotz, on the other hand, asserting that
                            there was never more than one native legion in Spain, adopts Mommsen's
                            emendation and reads vernacula et secunda . This drastic course seems
                            indeed the only method of including the Second; and the Fifth might well
                            be the one described as ' raised from the local Roman settlers'. But the
                            whole problem is obscure. See also ch. 13, note 1 (trans.).</note>:
                        while the rest were made up of runaways or auxiliaries. As for light-armed
                        units and cavalry, our troops were in fact far superior both in quality and
                        quantity. <note type="margin" n="8"/> Besides this, there was another factor
                        which prompted Pompeius to protract hostilities<note type="footnote" n="3">3
                            i.e. his strategic decision not to relieve Ategua was influenced not
                            only by his inferiority in troops, but also by the terrain.</note>—the
                        hilly type of country by no means unsuitable for the fortification of camps.
                        In fact, practically the whole region of Further Spain, fertile as it is and
                        correspondingly well watered, makes a siege a fruitless </p>

                    <p> and difficult task. Here too. in view of the constant sallies of the
                        natives, all places which are remote from towns are firmly held by towers
                        and fortifications, as in Africa, roofed over with rough-east, not tiles.
                        Moreover, they have watch-towers in them, commanding a view far and wide by
                        reason of their altitude. Again, a large proportion of the towns of this
                        province are more or less protected by the mountains and are established in
                        naturally elevated positions, with the result that the approach to them,
                        involving as it does a simultaneous climb, proves a difficult task. Thus it
                        is their natural position that holds them aloof from sieges, and as a result
                        the townships of Spain are no easy prey to an enemy, as proved to be the
                        ease in this war. To take the present instance: Pompeius had his camp
                        established between the above-mentioned towns of Ategua and Ueubi, in sight
                        of both of them and some four miles distant from his camp there lies a
                        hillock—a natural elevation which goes by the name of the Camp of Postumius
                            <note type="footnote" n="1" place="opposite">1 This is usually
                            identified with the modern hill of Harinilta, some 3 miles S. W. of
                            Teba. It was probably named after L. Postumius Albinus, propraetor of
                            Further Spain in 180-179.</note>: and there Caesar had established a
                        fort for purposes of defence. <note type="margin" n="9"/> Now Pompeius
                        observed that this fort was screened by its natural position on the same
                        ridge of hills and was some distance away from Caesar's camp; and he further
                        observed that Caesar, cut off as he was from it by the river Salsum, was not
                        likely to let himself be committed to sending support, considering the very
                        difficult character of the ground. Accordingly, with the courage of his
                        convictions, he set out at the third watch and proceeded to attack the fort.
                        On their approach they suddenly raised a shout and began to launch heavy
                        volleys of missile weapons, with the result that they wounded a large

                        and when the tidings were brought to Caesar in his main camp he set out with
                        three legions to succour our hard-pressed troops. When he reached them the
                        enemy retired in rout and panic,<note type="footnote" n="1" place="opposite"

                        the following day Arguetius arrived with cavalry from Italy. He brought with

                        legions. <note type="margin" n="11"/> On the next day our cavalry fared
                        somewhat far afield in the direction of Corduba in pursuit of those who were

                        captured and brought with their pack animals to our camp. That day Q.

                            whenever his chronology has got out of hand. Thus, just as in ch. 10 the

                            similar. Klotz, however, apparently takes it to mean ' when this time

                        soldiers from one of the native legions were captured by our cavalry: they
                        asserted they were slaves. Immediately on their arrival they were recognised
                        by troops who had formerly been with Fabius and Pedius and had deserted from
                            Trebonius.<note type="footnote" n="2">2 cf. p. 322 note 2 (trans.). It
                            is clear that not all the troops who had mutinied against Cassius and
                            later deserted Trebonius were now on Pompey's side. Some editors,
                            however, suspect the text.</note> No opportunity was afforded of
                        reprieving them, and they were executed by our troops. At the same time some

                        come to our camp in error: their hands were cut off and they were then let
                        go. At the second watch the enemy observed his usual custom of hurling from
                        the town a large quantity of fire-brands and missiles, spending a good long
                        time in the process and wounding a large number. When the night had now
                        passed they made a sally against the Sixth legion when our men were busily

                        fortifications from his camp to the river Salsum; and when a few of our
                        horsemen on outpost duty were discovered by the enemy, who were in greater
                        strength, they were driven from their post, and three of them were killed.
                        It was on that day that A. Valgius—his father was a senator and his brother
                        was in Pompeius' camp—left all his kit behind, mounted his horse and
                        deserted. A spy from the Second legion, on Pompeius' side,<note

                            Klotz regards the addition of Pompeiana as 'remarkable, since Caesar did
                            not have a Second legion.' It is true that in the narrative there is no
                            mention of the Second as fighting on Caesar's side. But neither is there
                            any mention of the Twenty-first, Twenty-eighth, or Thirtieth, all of
                            which may well have participated. I am inclined to think that Pompeiana
                            is no accidental addition, but that it signified clearly one of two
                            things: either that there were two Second legions (just as there were
                            apparently two Fifth legions), and that this was not Caesar's Second;
                            or, if there was but one Second legion, that now, after months of
                            wavering loyalty, it was on Pompey's side. To the author's
                            contemporaries it was doubtless perfectly clear which was the meaning

                            seems to me to suit the context better. Though apparently in the
                            singular number (Fleischer conjectured posituros), the message was no
                            doubt interpreted as reflecting the attitude of many of the

                        confident that they could now climb the wall and gain possession of the town

                        adjoining the wall; and having demolished a good large section of the first

                        the town by Pompeius. Caesar's reply to them was that his habit was to
                        impose conditions, not to accept them. On their return to the town with this
                        reply, the inhabitants raised a shout, discharged volleys of missiles of all
                        sorts, and went into action along the entire circuit of the battlements; and
                        this led to a strong conviction among quite a large number of the men in our
                        lines that they would make a sally that day. As a result a cordon of troops
                        was thrown round the town and very violent fighting went on for some time in
                        the course of which a missile was discharged by our men from a piece of
                        heavy artillery and demolished a tower, knocking out five members of the

                        action took place in view of both camps, and now the Pompeians were boasting

                            change of subject exceptionally harsh. It is perhaps more reasonable to
                            assume that Pompeiani is subject throughout, and that recipio is here

                        <note type="margin" n="15"/> With nearly all armies what normally happens in
                        a cavalry battle is this: when a cavalryman is once dismounted and closes in
                        with an infantryman to engage him, he is not by any means regarded as a
                        match for the latter. However, it turned out quite otherwise in this battle.
                        When picked light-armed infantry took our cavalry by surprise by coming
                        forward to engage them, and when this manoeuvre was observed in the course
                        of the fighting, quite a number of our horsemen dismounted. As a result, in
                        a short time our cavalry began to fight an infantry action, to such good
                        purpose that they dealt death right up close to the rampart. In this battle

                            killed out of several squadrons and some light-armed troops overrun by

                            suppression of casualty figures, ch. 18.) But I rather suspect that
                            cavalry reinforcements were despatched by Caesar and fought a second,
                            and more evenly-matched action closer to Pompey's camp; and that brief
                            details of this were originally given towards the end of ch. 14. If it
                            is to this second action that the casualty figures relate, then it is
                            not surprising that the Pompeians refused a third challenge on ground

                        Pompeians sent a courier, without the knowledge of our men, with

                        our towers and rampart on fire and make a sally at the third watch.
                        Accordingly, after they had hurled fire-brands and a quantity of missile
                        weapons and spent a very large part of the night in so doing, they opened
                        the gate which lay directly opposite Pompeius' camp and was in sight of it,
                        and made a sally with their entire forces. With them they brought out
                        brushwood and hurdles to fill up the trenches, as well as hooks for
                        demolishing and then burning the strawthatched huts which had been built by
                        our men to serve as winter quarters they also brought silver and clothing
                        besides, so that, while our men were busily engaged in looting it, they
                        could wreak havoc upon them and then retire to Pompeius' lines. For in the
                        belief that they could carry through their enterprise he spent the whole

                        deserve such punishment: rather had they themselves polluted hospitality by
                        a crime. Junius had said a lot more besides, according to the deserter's
                        account, and his words had frightened them and caused them to refrain from
                        further massacres. <note type="margin" n="17"/> So the next day Tullius came
                        as an envoy, accompanied by Cato and Antonius, and held talk with Caesar as
                        follows: ' Would indeed that the immortal gods had caused me to have become
                        a soldier of vours, rather than one of Pompeius', and vouchsafed that I

                            have sent such a message to Caesar from Pompey's camp. Whether it was
                            his master or his mistress he killed (in eh. 20 most MSS. read dominam),
                            and whether he was loyal to Caesar or to Pompey, it seems impossible to
                            account consistently for his actions and subsequent fate.</note> At a
                        later period two brothers, Lusitanians, deserted and reported a speech which
                        Pompeius had delivered, to the effect that, since he could not come to the
                        assistance of the town, they must withdraw by night out of sight of their
                        opponents in the direction of the sea. One man, according to this account,
                        retorted that they should rather go into battle than display the signal for
                        retreat; whereupon the author of this remark had his throat cut. At the same
                        time some of Pompeius' couriers were arrested on their way to the town.
                        Caesar presented their despatches <note type="footnote" n="2">2 Klotz

                        that any of the couriers who wanted his life to be spared must set fire to a

                        amnesty if he did so. But it was a difficult task for anyone to set fire to
                        that tower without risking disaster; thus when any of them came close up to
                        it, his legs were tied with a rope and he was killed by the townsfolk. That
                        same night a deserter reported that Pompeius and Labienus had been filled

                    <p> mother of a family leapt down from the battlements and slipped across to our
                        lines and told us that she had arranged with her household to desert to
                        Caesar all together but her household, she said, had been taken by surprise
                        and massacred. It was at this time also that a missive was thrown down from
                        the wall, which was found to contain the following message: ' L. Munatius
                        greets Caesar. If you grant me my life, now that I am abandoned by Cn.
                        Pompeius, I will guarantee to display the same unwavering courage in support
                        of you as I have shewn to him.' At the same time the envoys from the
                        townsfolk who had come out to Caesar before now came to him, saving that, if
                        he would spare their lives, they would surrender the town the following day.
                        His reply to them ran thus: ' I am Caesar and I will be as good as my word.'
                        Accordingly, on February 19th he took possession of the town and was hailed
                        as Imperator. <note type="margin" n="20"/> When Pompeius got to know from
                        deserters that the surrender of the town had taken place, he moved his camp
                        towards Ueubi, built forts at intervals in that locality, and proceeded to
                        keep within his emplacements. Caesar struck his camp and moved it closer to
                        that of Pompeius. It was at this same time that early in the morning one of
                        the heavy-armed troops from a native legion deserted to us and reported that
                        Pompeius had assembled the inhabitants of the town of Ueubi and given them

                        the enemy cavalry and quite a number of our light-armed troops died of their
                        wounds. That night some scouts were caught— three slaves and one soldier
                        from a native legion. The slaves were crucified, the soldier beheaded. <note

                        reached Ursao, our men. who comprised Roman knights and senators, did not
                        venture to enter the town, apart from those who were members of that
                        community. An exchange of views then took place between the </p>

                    <p> two sides; whereupon, as the envoys were rejoining our men who were outside
                        the town, the townsmen followed them up from behind with an armed party and
                        then massacred them. There were two survivors, who fled and reported the
                        incident to Caesar . . . and the men of Ursao sent investigators to the town
                        of Ategua. And when they had definitely established that the envoys' account
                        was correct, and that the incidents had occurred just as they had related, a
                        crowd of townsfolk quickly gathered, and they began to stone and shake their
                        fists at the man who had massacred the envoys, shouting that he had been
                        responsible for their own undoing. So when he had barely been rescued from
                        his perilous plight, he besought the townsfolk for leave to go on a mission
                        to Caesar, saying that he would satisfy the latter. Permission being
                        granted, he set out from the town, collected a bodyguard and, when he had
                        made it a good large force, contrived by treachery to be taken back into the
                        town by night. Whereupon he carried out a wholesale massacre, killed the
                        leading men who had been opposed to him. and took the town under his own

                        fair number of the enemy swooped down upon them from higher ground and, as
                        our men carried on with their work, there were not a few casualties among
                        them from the heavy volleys of enemy missiles. Hereupon, as Ennius puts it,
                        •¦ our men gave ground for a brief space." Consequently, when our men
                        observed that they were giving ground more than their wont, two centurions
                        from the Fifth legion crossed the river and restored the battle line <note
                            type="footnote" n="2">2 It would seem that Caesar's main camp was still
                            N. of the river Salsum, whereas Pompeius was S. of it. But Caesar may

                            Castra Postumiana. ch. 8); and the present context suggests, I think,
                            that his sappers were working S. of the river and that their desperate
                            plight was observed by their comrades, and relieved by the cavalry, from

                        succumbed to a heavy volley of missiles discharged from higher ground. And
                        so his colleague now began an uphill fight and when he observed that he was
                        being completely surrounded, he retreated and lost his footing. As this

                        decorations: but our cavalry crossed the river and from lower ground

                        within the area of the latter's defence positions, they were cut off by
                        enemy squadrons and light-armed troops. Had not their gallantry been of the
                        highest order, they would have been captured alive; for they were, moreover,
                        hemmed in so tightly by the emplacements of the camp as to make it well nigh
                        impossible for a horseman to defend himself in the restricted space. As a
                        result of both types of engagement <note type="footnote" n="1"

                        from the two centurions, who bore themselves with outstanding distinction.

                        so that it almost seemed as if their duel meant the final decision and

                        cavalry were withdrawing to camp, the enemy pursued them too eagerly,
                        whereupon the light-armed troops one and all raised a shout and charged

                        inexperienced army into the field, and, pinned down so far by our

                        accordingly not only protect the townships which belong to our side, but

                        his principal camp. Later on Caesar proceeded to assault the town of
                        Ventipo; and when it capitulated he marched to Carruca,<note type="footnote"

                        over against Pompeius. <note type="margin" n="28"/> On the following day
                        Caesar was minded to take the road with his forces when scouts came back
                        with the news that Pompeius had been in battle formation since the third
                        watch. On receipt of this news Caesar displayed the flag-signal for action.
                        Now the reason why Pompeius had led out his forces was this: </p>

                    <p> he had previously sent a despatch to the citizens of Ursao, who were
                        supporters of his. saying that Caesar was unwilling to come down info the
                        valley because the greater part of his army was inexperienced. This despatch
                        stiffened the morale of the townsfolk considerably. Pompeius therefore,
                        relying on this conviction.<note type="footnote" n="1" place="opposite">1
                            Klotz takes this to mean the more confident attitude of the men of
                            Ursao. But would their increased confidence by itself lead Pompey to
                            think he could carry the whole thing off? It seems to me more likely
                            that what the author really meant was this: " The reason why Pompey had
                            led his forces out was that Caesar—so he had told the men of<pb n="363"

                            unwilling to come down to engage. Pompey accordingly, relying on this
                            conviction (viz. that Caesar would decline battle), supposed he could

                        whole thing off; for where he had established his camp he was protected not
                        only by the natural conformation of the ground but also by the
                        fortifications of the town itself. For, as we have pointed out earlier,<note

                            supposition that Munda was on the site of the modern Montilla, rather

                        bastioned by hills with an occasional intervening plain; and this, it so
                        happened, was the case on the present occasion. <note type="margin" n="29"/>
                        Between the two camps ran a plain, extending for some five miles, so that
                        there were two factors which made for the protection of Pompeius' troops—the
                        town, and the lofty nature of the ground. Extending from the town the plain
                        ground nearest to it levelled out, and ran down to where a stream ran in
                        front of it, which made the ground there extremely awkward for Caesar's
                        troops to approach the Pompeians; for the soil to the right of the river's
                        course was marshy and full of bog-holes. Consequently, when Caesar saw their
                        battle line deployed, he had no doubt that </p>







                    <pb n="365"/>

                    <p> his opponents would advance to the level ground to do battle in the middle
                        of the plain. This area was in full view of all. Moreover, with a level
                        plain like that and a calm, sunny day, it was a tempting situation for
                        cavalry—a wonderful, longed-for and well-nigh heaven-sent opportunity for
                        engaging-battle. Our men were delighted—though some also had misgivings—at
                        the thought that the welfare and fortunes of everyone Mere being brought to
                        the point that no one could tell for certain what would prove to be the luck
                        vouchsafed them an hour later. And so our men advanced to do battle and we
                        supposed that the enemy would do likewise: but our opponents would not
                        venture to advance far from the defences of the town: on the contrary, they
                        were establishing themselves in the town close to the wall. And so our men
                        advanced. From time to time the favourable nature of the ground would sorely
                        tempt the enemy to press on to victory under such conditions but, none the
                        less, they would not depart from their accustomed tactics so as to forsake
                        either the high ground or the town. And when our men. advancing at a
                        moderate pace, came up closer to the stream, their opponents remained
                        consistently on the defensive on the steep ground. <note type="margin"

                        to avoid any blunder being perpetrated owing to rashness or faulty judgment,
                        he began to restrict the operational area.<note type="footnote" n="1"

                            as yet of the strength of the enemy's prepared positions on the

                        doing so, they were bitterly disgusted, as they took it to mean that their
                        chance of deciding the conflict was being hampered. This delay made the
                        enemy keener: it was fear, they thought, that was preventing Caesar's forces
                        from joining battle: and although by displaying themselves they gave our men
                        the opportunity of engaging them on steep ground, yet it was only at great
                        risk that one could approach them. On our side the men of the Tenth legion
                        held their proper post—the right wing; while the men of the Third and Fifth
                        legions together with all the rest of our forces—the auxiliary troops and
                        the cavalry—held the left wing. The shout was raised and the battle joined.
                            <note type="margin" n="31"/> Hereupon, although our men were superior in
                        point of valour, their opponents offered a very spirited resistance from
                        their higher position and so furious proved the shouting on both sides, so
                        furious the charging with its attendant volley of missiles, that our men
                        well nigh lost their confidence in victory. In fact, as regards attacking
                        and shouting—the two chief methods of demoralising an enemy—both sides stood
                        on equal terms of comparison. But, though they accordingly brought to the
                        contest an equal fighting capacity in both these departments of battle, yet
                        the enemy masses were pinned down by our volleys of heavy javelins, and fell
                        in heaps. Our right wing, </p>

                        their small numbers, their gallantry none the less enabled them by their
                        exertions to inspire no little panic among their opponents. They proceeded,
                        in fact, to exert strong pressure on the enemy, driving him back from his
                        positions, with the result that he began to transfer a legion from his
                        right, to give support and to prevent our men from outflanking him. As soon
                        as this legion had been set in motion Caesar's cavalry began to exert
                        pressure on the enemy left wing,<note type="footnote" n="1" place="opposite"

                            increased pressure by the cavalry on the enemy's left wing might well
                            have made effective reinforcement impracticable.</note> so that, no
                        matter how gallantly the enemy might fight, he was afforded no opportunity
                        of reinforcing his line. And .so, as the motley din—shouts, groans, the
                        clash of swords—assailed their ears, it shackled the minds of the
                        inexperienced with fear. Hereupon, as Ennius puts it, " foot forces against
                        foot and weapons grind ' gainst weapons " and in the teeth of very strong
                        opposition our men began to drive the enemy back. The town, however, stood
                        them in good stead. And so they were routed and put to flight on the very

                        made the town of Munda their refuge, and our men were of necessity compelled
                        to blockade them. Shields and javelins taken from among the enemy's weapons
                        were placed to serve as a palisade, dead bodies as a rampart on top, impaled
                        on sword points, severed human heads were ranged in a row all facing -the
                        town, the object being not merely to enclose the enemy by a palisade, but to
                        afford him an awe-inspiring spectacle by displaying before him this evidence
                        of valour. Having thus encircled the town with the javelins and spears taken
                        from the corpses of the enemy, the Gallic troops now proceeded to assault
                        it. From this battle the young Valerius escaped to Corduba with a few
                        horsemen, and delivered his report of it to Sextus Pompeius, who was present
                        there. On learning of these events, the latter divided what money he had
                        with him among his present cavalry force, told the townsfolk that he was
                        setting out for peace talks with Caesar, and left the town at the second
                        watch. Cn. Pompeius, attended by a few horsemen and some infantry, pressed
                        forward on the other hand to the naval fortified base of Carteia, a town
                        which lies one hundred and seventy miles away from Corduba. When he had

                        been in command of Pompeius' camp, sent a message dictated by Pompeius
                        saying that he was in a bad way, and they must send a litter in which he
                        could be earned into the town. A litter and bearers were despatched, and
                        Pompeius was earned to Carteia. His partisans forgathered at the house to
                        which he had been brought—each supposing his visit to have been a private
                        one—to make enquiry </p>

                        Munda with a ting of emplacements and came to Corduba. The survivors of the
                        carnage who had taken refuge there seized the bridge; and when Caesar <note

                            they began to jeer, viz. at the members of the Caesarian faction, who
                            wished them further, since their presence would lessen the chances of

                        resin and nard. Accordingly, at the latest possible moment, he bade a slave
                        and a freedman— the latter was his concubine—the one to cut his throat, the

                        <note type="margin" n="34"/> Now as soon as Caesar pitched his camp over
                        against the town its occupants proceeded to quarrel; so much so that the
                        sound of the shouting and brawling between the supporters of Caesar on the
                        one hand, and Pompeius on the other, reached our camp. There were two
                        legions in this town which had been raised partly from deserters, while
                        others were slaves of the townsmen who had been set free by Sextus Pompeius
                        and now in view of Caesar's approach they began to desert. The Thirteenth
                        legion proceeded to defend the town, whereas the men of the Ninth, as soon
                        as they became involved in the fray, seized some of the towers and
                        battlements. Once again <note type="footnote" n="1" place="opposite">1 cf.
                            ch. 2.</note> they sent envoys to Caesar, requesting that he should send
                        in his legions to support them; and when the refugees got to know of it they
                        proceeded to set fire to the town.<note type="footnote" n="2"
                            place="opposite">2 The state of the text makes the sketchy narrative

                            33?) were still bent fanatically on resistance, while the Ninth (?) was
                            ready to surrender.</note> But they were overpowered by our men and put
                        to death, to the number of twenty-two thousand men, not counting those who
                        lost their lives outside the battlements. Thus did Caesar gain possession of
                        the town. While he was occupied here, the survivors of the battle who had
                        been shut up (in Munda), as we described above,<note type="footnote" n="3">3
                            in ch. 32.</note> made a sally, only to be driven back into the town

                        Hispalis envoys came to him to entreat his pardon. So when he reached the
                        town, he sent in Caninius as his deputy, accompanied by a garrison force,
                        while he himself pitched camp near the town. Now inside the town there was a </p>






                    <pb n="377"/>

                    <p> good large group of supporters of Pompeius, who thought it scandalous that a
                        garrison should have been admitted unbeknown to a certain Philo—the man who
                        had been the most ardent champion of the Pompeian faction, and was a very
                        well-known figure throughout Lusitania. This man now set out for Lusitania
                        without the knowledge of our garrison troops, and at Lennium met Caecilius
                        Niger, a foreigner, who had a good large force of Lusitaniam. Returning to
                        Hispalis. he penetrated the fortifications by night and thus gained
                        re-admission to the town; whereupon they massacred the garrison and
                        sentries, barred the gates, and renewed hostilities. <note type="margin"
                            n="36"/> In the course of these proceedings envoys from Carteia duly
                        reported that they had Pompeius in their hands. They thought they stood to
                        gain by this good deed, which might offset their previous offence in having
                        barred their gates to Caesar. At Hispalis the Lusitanians kept up the fight
                        without a moment's pause; and when Caesar observed their stubbornness he was
                        afraid that, if he made strenuous efforts to capture the town, these
                        desperadoes might fire the town and destroy the walls. So after holding
                        consultations he allowed the Lusitanians to make a sally by night—a course
                        which the latter never supposed was deliberate policy. Accordingly, they
                        made a sally, and in the process fired some ships which were alongside the
                        river Baetis. While our men were occupied with the fire, the Lusitanians
                        took to flight and were cut down by our cavalry. This led to the recovery of
                        the town; whereupon Caesar proceeded to march to Asta. from which township
                        envoys came to him to surrender it. As for the survivors of the battle who
                        had taken refuge in the </p>

                    <p> town of Munda, a somewhat protracted siege led a good large number to
                        surrender: and on being drafted to form a legion they swore a mutual oath
                        that during the night at a given signal their comrades in the town should
                        make a sally, while they carried out a massacre in the camp. Rut this plot
                        was discovered; and when at the third watch on the following night the
                        pass-word was given, they were all cut down outside the rampart.<note
                            type="footnote" n="1" place="opposite">1 This rendering assumes that
                            tessera refers to signo; that the plot was allowed to take place by

                            advance, intervened and cut down all the insurgents (omnes = both
                            groups?) outside the rampart. Klotz, however, holds the view that the
                            conspirators were arrested as soon as the plot was discovered, and then,
                            very early next morning, led outside the rampart and there executed. The
                            fact that, as he observes,<pb n="379"/> such executions commonly took
                            place around dawn and outside the rampart (cf. Bell. Afr. ch. 46)
                            favours this view: against it it may perhaps be argued that the verb
                            concidere is more appropriate to a surprise attack.</note>
                        <note type="margin" n="37"/> While Caesar was on the move and attacking the
                        remaining towns, the men of Carteia began to fall out on the question of
                        Pompeius. There was the party which had sent envoys to Caesar: there was
                        another party which espoused the cause of Pompeius. Civil discord being thus
                        stirred up, they seized the gates: much blood was shed: Pompeius, who was
                            wounded,<note type="footnote" n="2">2 That Pompey had been wounded at

                        as the news of his escape reached Didius, who was at Gades in command of a
                        squadron, he forthwith began to give chase and from Carteia too the hunt was
                        likewise taken up forthwith by infantry and cavalry marching in swift
                        pursuit. On the fourth day of their voyage Pompeius' party put in to land,
                        since they had been ill provided and without water when they sailed from
                        Carteia. While they were getting water Didius hastened up with his fleet,
                        captured some of their ships, and burned the rest. </p>





                    <pb n="381"/>


                    <p>
                        <note type="margin" n="38"/> Pompeius took to flight with a few companions
                        and occupied a certain spot which possessed natural defences. When the
                        cavalry and infantry cohorts which had been despatched in his pursuit
                        learned of this from scouts they had sent on ahead, they pushed on day and
                        night. Now Pompeius was seriously wounded in the shoulder and left leg added
                        to which he had also sprained his ankle, which hampered him very much. So a
                        litter was employed to carry him off to this redoubt and. once arrived
                        there, he continued to be carried about in it. One of the Lusitanians who
                        had been despatched from his escort on reconnaissance in accordance with
                        normal military routine was now spotted by the Caesarian force, and Pompeius
                        was promptly surrounded by the cavalry and cohorts. It was a difficult place
                        to approach: that in fact was the very reason why Pompeius had chosen
                        himself a naturally fortified position, so that, no matter how great a force
                        was brought up to it, a handful of men might be able to defend it from
                        higher ground. On their arrival our men came up close to it only to be
                        driven back with javelins. As they gave ground the enemy pressed upon them
                        the more eagerly and called an immediate halt to their advance. When this
                        manoeuvre had been repeated several times it became obvious that it was a
                        very risky business for our men. The enemy <note type="footnote" n="1">1 In

                        began to fortify his position with a circumvallation; our men, however,
                        acting with speed and despatch, carried a similar circumvallation along the
                        high ground, to enable them to </p>




                    <pb n="383"/>

                    <p> encounter their opponents on an equal footing. When the latter observed this
                        move they took refuge in flight. <note type="margin" n="39"/> Pompeius, as
                        we have pointed out above, was wounded and had sprained his ankle, and this
                        handicapped him in flight; moreover, the difficult nature of the ground made
                        it impossible for him to have recourse to riding horseback or driving to
                        assist his escape to safety. On all sides our troops were carrying on the
                        work of slaughter. Cut off from his entrenchment and having lost his
                        supporters, Pompeius now resorted to a ravine, to a spot where the ground
                        was eaten away; and there in a eave he proceeded to hide himself, so that,
                        short of his being given away by a prisoner, it was no easy matter for our
                        men to find him. By such means in fact he was discovered there and put to
                        death. When Caesar was at Gades, the head of Pompeius was brought to
                        Hispalis on April 12th, and there publicly exhibited. <note type="margin"
                            n="40"/> Filled with delight at the death of the young Pompeius, Didius,
                        whom we mentioned above, withdrew to a nearby stronghold, beached some of
                        his ships for a refit, and . . . Those Lusitanians who survived the battle
                        rallied to their standard and, when a good large force had been mustered,
                        duly proceeded against Didius. Although he displayed no lack of care in
                        guarding his ships, yet their constant sallies enticed him on occasions to
                        leave his stronghold, with the result that in the course of almost daily
                        battles they laid a trap for him, dividing up their forces into three
                        groups. There were some who were detailed to burn the ships some to repel an
                        enemy relief force, when the ships had once been </p>

                        view, whereas the remainder marched into battle in full view of all.
                        Accordingly, when Didius advanced with his forces from his stronghold to
                        drive them back, the signal was displayed by the Lusitanians, the ships were
                        set on fire, and simultaneously those who had advanced to battle from the
                        stronghold—they were now pursuing the retreating bandits, who had turned
                        tail on that same signal—were surprised by the ambushing party, which raised
                        a shout and surrounded them from the rear.<note type="footnote" n="1"

                        some pinnaces which were close inshore, while quite a number, on the other

                        began to row them out to sea, thereby saving their lives. The Lusitanians
                        gained possession of the booty. Caesar left Gades and hastened back to
                        Hispalis. <note type="margin" n="41"/> Fabius Maximus, who had been left
                        behind by Caesar to attack the enemy garrison at Munda, besieged that town
                        in a continuous series of operations by day and night. Now that they were
                        cut off the enemy fell to fighting amongst themselves; and after a welter of
                        bloodshed they made a sally. Our troops did not fail to take this
                        opportunity of recovering the town and captured the remaining men alive, to
                        the number of fourteen thousand. Our men now set out for Ursao, a town which
                        was buttressed by massive fortifications, to such an extent that in itself
                        the place seemed adapted to </p>

                            appears to mean ' to assail a (besieging) enemy ", the implication
                            possibly being 'go over to the offensive against'; but the text is very

                        artificial fortification. Added to this, apart from a single fountain in the
                        town itself, there was no water to be found anywhere in the neighbourhood
                        under eight miles from the town: and this was a great advantage to the
                        townsfolk. Then again there was the additional circumstance that materials
                        for a rampart, . . . and timber, which they habitually used for the
                        construction of towers and mantlets, was not to be found under six miles'
                        distance from the town; and in order the more to safeguard himself against
                        an attack upon it, Pompeius had had all the timber in the neighbourhood
                        felled and dumped inside it. Thus our troops were under the necessity of
                        detaching men to carry timber thither from Munda, the town they had just
                        recently captured. <note type="margin" n="42"/> While these operations were
                        proceeding at Munda and Ursao, Caesar left Gades and returned to Hispalis,
                        and on the day after his arrival there summoned an assembly of the people.
                        He reminded them that at the outset of his quaestorship <note

                        concern, and had liberally bestowed on it such benefits as lay in his power
                        at that time that when subsequently he had been promoted to the praetor-ship

                        secured the province immunity from paying the money in question that having
                        once taken upon himself to champion the province he had defended it, not
                        only introducing numerous deputations into the Senate </p>

                    <p> but also undertaking legal actions both public and private, and thereby
                        incurring the enmity of many men. Similarly, during the period of his
                        consulship <note type="footnote" n="1" place="opposite">1 59 B.C. with
                            Bibulus.</note> he had bestowed on the province in his absence such
                        advantages as lay in his power. Yet both in the present war and in the
                        period before it he was well aware that they had been unmindful of all these
                        advantages, and ungrateful for them, both towards himself and towards the
                        Roman people. ' You,' he went on, ' who are well acquainted with the law of
                        nations and the established usages of Roman citizens, have none the less
                        behaved like savages and have laid violent hands more often than once upon
                        the inviolable magistrates of the Roman people, and designed the dastardly

                        always so hated peace that this province has never ceased to be occupied by
                        the legions of the Roman people. With you good deeds count as misdeeds, and
                        vice versa. Consequently you have never been able to maintain harmony in
                        peace or high morale in war. It was you who harboured the young Cn. Pompeius
                        after his flight it was at your instigation that, albeit a private citizen,
                        he seized the rods of office and usurped military command, put many citizens
                        to death, raised armed forces to fight the Roman people, and laid waste the
                        territories of the province. On what field did you come out victorious? Or
                        didn't you take into consideration the fact that, if I were done away with,
                        the Roman people possessed legions which could not only offer you resistance
                        but could also cause the heavens to fall? By their glorious deeds of valour
