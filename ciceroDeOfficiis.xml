    <ab><title>INTRODUCTION</title></ab>
    <p> In the de Officiis we have, save for the latter Philippics, the great orator's last
     contribution to literature. The last, sad, troubled years of his busy life could not be given
     to his profession; and he turned his never-resting thoughts to the second love of his student
     days and made Greek philosophy a possibility for Roman readers. The senate had been abolished;
     the courts had been closed. His occupation was gone; but Cicero could not surrender himself to
     idleness. In those days of distraction (46-43 B.C.) he produced for publication almost as much
     as in all his years of active life. The liberators had been able to remove the tyrant, but they
     could not restore the republic. Cicero's own life was in danger from the fury of mad Antony and
     he left Rome about the end of March, 44 B.C. He dared not even stop permanently in any one of
     his various country estates, but, wretched, wandered from one of his villas to another nearly
     all the summer and autumn through. He would not suffer himself to become a prey to his
     overwhelming sorrow at the death of the republic and the final crushing of the hopes that had
     risen with Caesar's downfall, but worked at the highest tension on his philosophical studies.
     The Romans were not philosophical. In 161 B.C. the senate passed a decree excluding all
     philosophers and teachers of rhetoric from the city. They had no taste for philosophical
     speculation, in which the Greeks were the world's masters. They were intensely, narrowly
     practical. And Cicero was thorough-</p>
    <pb n="ix"/>
    <p>ly Roman. As a student in a Greek university he had had to study philosophy. His mind was
     broad enough and his soul great enough to give him a joy in following after the mighty masters,
     Socrates, Plato, Zeno, Cleanthes, Aristotle, Theophrastus, and the rest. But he pursued his
     study of it, like a Roman, from a 'practical" motive—to promote thereby his power as an orator
     and to augment his success and happiness in life. To him the goal of philosophy was not
     primarily to know but to do. Its end was to point out the course of conduct that would lead to
     success and happiness. The only side of philosophy, therefore, that could make much appeal to
     the Roman mind was ethics; pure science could have little meaning for the practical Roman;
     metaphysics might supplement ethics and religion, without which true happiness was felt to be
     impossible. Philosophical study had its place, therefore, and the most important department of
     philosophy was ethics. The treatise on Moral Duties has the very practical purpose of giving a
     practical discussion of the basic principles of Moral Duty and practical rules for personal
     conduct. As a philosopher, if we may so stretch the term as to include him, Cicero avows
     himself an adherent of the New Academy and a disciple of Carneades. He had tried Epicureanism
     under Phaedrus and Zeno, Stoicism under Diodotus and Posidonius; but Philo of Larissa converted
     him to the New Academy. Scepticism declared the attainment of absolute knowledge impossible.
     But there is the easily obtainable golden mean of the probable; and that appealed to the
     practical Roman. It appealed especially to Cicero; and the same indecision that had been
     his</p>
    <pb n="x"/>
    <p>bane in political life naturally led him first to scepticism, then to eclecticism, where his
     choice is dictated by his bias for the practical and his scepticism itself disappears from
     view. And while Antiochus, the eclectic Academician of Athens, and Posidonius, the eclectic
     Stoic of Rhodes, seem to have had the strongest influence upon him, he draws at his own
     discretion from the founts of Stoics, Peripatetics, and Academicians alike; he has only
     contempt for the Epicureans, Cynics, and Cyrenaics. But the more he studied and lived, the more
     of a Stoic in ethics he became. The cap-sheaf of Cicero's ethical studies is the treatise on
     the Moral Duties. It takes the form of a letter addressed to his son Marcus (see Index), at
     this time a youth of twenty-one, pursuing his university studies in the Peripatetic school of
     Cratippus in Athens, and sowing for what promised to be an abundant crop of wild oats. This
     situation gives force and definiteness to the practical tendencies of the father's ethical
     teachings. And yet, be it observed, that same father is not without censure for contributing to
     his son's extravagant and riotous living by giving him an allowance of nearly £870 a year. Our
     Roman makes no pretensions to originality in philosophic thinking. He is a follower—an
     expositor—of the Greeks. As the basis of his discussion of the Moral Duties he takes the Stoic
     Panaetius of Rhodes (see Index), Περὶ Καθήκοντος, drawing also from many other sources, but
     following him more or less closely in Books I and II; Book III is more independent and much
     inferior. He is usually superficial and not always clear. He translates and</p>
    <pb n="xi"/>
    <p>paraphrases Greek philosophy, weaving in illustrations from Roman history and suggestions of
     Roman mould in a form intended to make it, if not popular, at least comprehensible, to the
     Roman mind. How well he succeeded is evidenced by the comparative receptivity of Roman soil
     prepared by Stoic doctrine for the teachings of Christianity. Indeed, Anthony Trollope labels
     our author the "Pagan Christian." "You would fancy sometimes," says Petrarch, "it is not a
     Pagan philosopher but a Christian apostle who is speaking." No less an authority than Frederick
     the Great has called our book the best work on morals that has been or can be written." Cicero
     himself looked upon it as his masterpiece. It has its strength and its weakness—its sane common
     sense and noble patriotism, its self-conceit and partisan politics; it has the master's
     brilliant style, but it is full of repetitions and rhetorical flourishes, and it fails often in
     logical order and power; it rings true in its moral tone, but it shows in what haste and
     distraction it was composed; for it was not written as a contribution to close scientific
     thinking; it was written as a means of occupation and diversion.</p>

      at Mainz is a little older. Both appeared in 1465. The latter was the first to print the Greek
      words in Greek type. The de Officiis is, therefore, the first classical book to be issued from
      a printing press, with the possible exception of Lactantius and Cicero's de Oratore which bear
      the more exact date of October 30, 1465, and were likewise issued from the Monastery press at

      year under Cratippus, and that too in Athens, and you should be fully equipped with the
      practical precepts and the principles of philosophy; so much at least one might expect from
      the preeminence not only of your teacher but also of the city; the former is able to enrich
      you with learning, the latter to supply you with models. Nevertheless, just as I for my own
      improvement have always combined Greek and Latin studies—and I have done this not only in the
      study of philosophy but also in the practice of oratory—so I recommend that you should do the
      same, so that you may have equal command of both languages. And it is in this very direction
      that I have, if I mistake not, rendered a great service to our countrymen, so that not only
      those who are unacquainted with Greek literature but even the cultured consider that they have
      gained much both in oratorical power and in mental training. <note type="margin" n="2"

      you are making. For all that, if you will read my philosophical books, you will be helped; my
      philosophy is not very different from that of the Peripatetics (for both they and I claim to
      be followers of Socrates and Plato). As to the conclusions you may reach, I leave that to your

     <p> writings you will be sure to render your mastery of the Latin language more complete. But I
      would by no means have you think that this is said boastfully. For there are many to whom I
      yield precedence in knowledge of philosophy; but if I lay claim to the orator's peculiar
      ability to speak with propriety, clearness, elegance, I think my claim is in a measure
      justified, for I have spent my life in that profession. <note type="margin" n="3">3</note> And

      mine on philosophy, which are now about as extensive. For while the orations exhibit a more
      vigorous style, yet the unimpassioned, restrained style of my philosophical productions is
      also worth cultivating. Moreover, for the same man to succeed in both departments, both in the
      forensic style and in that of calm philosophic discussion has not, I observe, been the good
      fortune of any one of the Greeks so far, unless, perhaps, Demetrius of Phalerum can be
      reckoned in that number—a clever reasoner, indeed, and, though rather a spiritless orator, he
      is yet charming, so that you can recognize in him the disciple of Theophrastus. But let others
      judge how much I have accomplished in each pursuit; I have at least attempted both. <note
       type="margin" n="4">4</note> I believe, of course, that if Plato had been willing to devote
      himself to forensic oratory, he could have spoken with the greatest eloquence and power; and
      that if Demosthenes had continued the studies he pursued with Plato and had wished to expound
      his views, he could have done so with elegance and brilliancy. I feel the same way about
      Aristotle and Isocrates, each of whom, engrossed in his own profession, undervalued that of
      the other. </p>

      possible, to begin with a matter most suited at once to your years and to my position.
      Although philosophy offers many problems, both important and useful, that have been fully and
      carefully discussed by philosophers, those teachings which have been handed down on the
      subject of moral duties seem to have the widest practical application. For no phase of life,
      whether public or private, whether in business or in the home, whether one is working on what
      concerns oneself alone or dealing with another, can be without its moral duty; on the
      discharge of such duties depends all that is morally right, and on their neglect all that is
      morally wrong in life. <note type="margin" n="5">5</note> Moreover, the subject of this
      inquiry is the common <note type="margin">The philosophic schools and ethical teaching</note>
      property of all philosophers; for who would presume to call himself a philosopher, if he did
      not inculcate any lessons of duty? But there are some schools that distort all notions of duty
      by the theories they propose touching the supreme good and the supreme evil. For he who posits
      the supreme good as having no connection with virtue and measures it not by a moral standard
      but by his own interests— if he should be consistent and not rather at times over-ruled by his
      better nature, he could value neither friendship nor justice nor generosity; and brave he
      surely cannot possibly be that counts pain the supreme evil, nor temperate he that holds
      pleasure to be the supreme good. <note type="margin" n="6">6</note> Although these truths are
      so self-evident that the <note type="margin">Reasons for subject and authorities</note>does
      not call for discussion, still I have dis cussed it in another connection. If, therefore,

     <p> schools should claim to be consistent, they could not say anything about duty; and no
      fixed, invariable, natural rules of duty can be posited except by those who say that moral
      goodness is worth seeking solely or chiefly for its own sake. Accordingly, the teaching of
      ethics is the peculiar right of the Stoics, the Academicians, and the Peripatetics; for the
      theories of Aristo, Pyrrho, and Erillus have been long since rejected; and yet they would have
      the right to discuss duty if they had left us any power of choosing between things, so that
      there might be a way of finding out what duty is. I shall, therefore, at this time and in this
      investigation follow chiefly the Stoics, not as a translator, but, as is my custom, I shall at
      my own option and discretion draw from those sources in such measure and in such manner as

      absolute; whether one duty is more important than another; and so on. But as regards special
      duties for which positive rules are laid down, though they are affected by the doctrine of the

       short of the 'absolute ' and occupying a middle ground; common; ordinary. hon stum is '
       morally right'; as a noun, ' moral goodness' (= honestas); its opposite is turpe, 'morally
       wrong.' honestas is 'moral rectitude,'—' moral goodness'; 'morality '; its opposite
       turpitudo,' moral wrong,'' immorality.'</note> duty, so-called, and "absolute" duty. Absolute
      duty we may, I presume; call " right," for the Greeks call it καθῆκον, while the ordinary duty
      they call καθῆκον. And the meaning of those terms they fix thus: whatever is right they define
      as absolute duty, but 1 mean" duty, they say, is duty for the performance of which an adequate
      reason may be rendered. <note type="margin" n="9">9</note> The consideration necessary to

      the contemplated act is morally right or morally wrong; and in such deliberation their minds
      are often led to widely divergent conclusions. And then they examine and consider the question
      whether the action contemplated is or is not conducive to comfort and happiness in life, to
      the command of means and wealth, to influence, and to power, by which they may be able to help
      themselves and their friends; this whole matter turns upon a question of expediency. The third
      type of question arises when that which seems to be expedient seems to conflict with that
      which is morally right; for when expediency seems to be pulling one way, while moral right
      seems to be calling back in the opposite direction, the result is that the mind is distracted
      in its inquiry and brings to it the irresolution that is born of deliberation. <note

      thought threefold ought, we find, to be divided into five parts. First, therefore, we must

      establishments and the comforts of life in elegance and abundance also afford pleasure, and
      the desire to secure it gives rise to the insatiable thirst for wealth. Still, I do not mean
      to find fault with the accumulation of property, provided it hurts nobody, but unjust
      acquisition of it is always to be avoided.:6 The great majority of people, however, when they
      fall a prey to ambition for either military or civil authority, are carried away by it so
      completely that they quite lose sight of the claims of justice. For Ennius says: <note

      competition for it usually becomes so keen that it is an extremely difficult matter to
      maintain a fellowship inviolate." We saw this <note type="margin">Caesar</note> proved but now

      trouble about this matter is that it is in the greatest souls and in the most brilliant

      which I laid down at the outset: first, that no harm be done to anyone; second, that the
      common interests be conserved. When these are modified under changed circumstances, moral duty
      also undergoes a change, <note type="margin" n="32">32</note> and it does not always remain
      the same. For a given promise or agreement may turn out in such a way <note type="margin"
       >Non-fulfilment of promises</note>that its performance will prove detrimental either to the
      one to whom the promise has been made or to the one who has made it. If, for example, Neptune,
      in the drama, had not carried out his promise to Theseus, Theseus would not have lost his son
      Hippolytus; for, as the story runs, of the three wishes<note type="footnote" n="a">a The three
       wishes were: (1) safe return from Hades; (2) escape from the Labyrinth; (3) the death of
       Hippolytus.</note> that Neptune had promised to grant him the third was this: in a fit of
      anger he prayed for the death of Hippolytus, and the granting of this prayer plunged him into
      unspeakable grief. Promises are, therefore, not to be kept, if the keeping of them is to prove
      harmful to those to whom you have made them; and, if the fulfilment of a promise should do
      more harm to you than good to him to whom you have made it, it is no violation of moral duty
      to give the greater good precedence over the lesser good. For example, if you have made an
      appointment with anyone to appear as his advocate in court, and if in the meantime your son
      should fall dangerously ill, it would be no breach of your moral duty to fail in what you
      agreed to do; nay, rather, he to whom your promise was given would have a false conception of
      duty, if he should complain that he had been deserted in his time of need. Further than this,

      inalienable for ever in dealings with a stranger" (hostis). What can exceed such charity, when
      he with whom one is at war is called by so gentle a name? And yet long lapse of time has given
      that word a harsher meaning: for it has lost its signification of "stranger" and has taken on

      not fail to start from the same motives which I said a moment ago were the only righteous

      with less bitterness. For we contend, for example, with a fellow-citizen in one way, if he is
      a personal enemy, in another, if he is a rival: with the rival it is a struggle for office and
      position, with the enemy for life and honour. So with the Celtiberians and the Cimbrians we
      fought as with deadly enemies, not to determine which should be supreme, but which should
      survive; but with the Latins, Sabines, Samnites, Carthaginians, and Pyrrhus we fought for
      supremacy. The Carthaginians violated treaties; Hannibal was cruel; the others were more
      merciful. From Pyrrhus we have this famous speech on the exchange of prisoners: Gold will I
      none, nor price shall ye give; for I ask none; Come, let us not be chaff'rers of war, but
      warriors embattled. Nay; let us venture our lives, and the sword, not gold, weigh the outcome. </p>

     <p>guilty of perjury in not returning. And they punished in like manner the one who had
      incurred guilt by an evasion of his oath: with Hannibal's permission this man left the camp
      and returned a little later on the pretext that he had forgotten something or other; and then,
      when he left the camp the second time, he claimed that he was released from the obligation of
      his oath; and so he was, according to the letter of it, but not according to the spirit. In
      the matter of a promise one must always consider the meaning and not the mere words. Our
      forefathers have given us another striking example of justice toward an enemy: when a deserter
      from Pyrrhus promised the senate to administer poison to the king and thus work his death, the
      senate and Gaius Fabricius delivered the deserter up to Pyrrhus. Thus they stamped with their
      disapproval the treacherous murder even of an enemy who was at once powerful, unprovoked,
      aggressive, and successful. With this I will close my discussion of the duties connected with
      war. But let us remember that we must have regard <note type="margin">Justice to ward
       slaves</note>for justice even towards the humblest. Now the humblest station and the poorest
      fortune are those of slaves; and they give us no bad rule who bid us treat our slaves as we

      an injury either to the object of our beneficence or to others; in the second place, that it
      shall not be beyond our means; and finally, that it shall be proportioned to the worthiness of
      the recipient; for this is the corner-stone of justice; and by the standard of justice all
      acts of kindness must be measured. For those who confer a harmful favour upon some one whom
      they seemingly wish to help are to be accounted not generous benefactors but dangerous
      sycophants; and likewise those who injure one man, in order to be generous to another, are
      guilty of the same injustice as if they diverted to their own accounts the property of their
      neighbours. Now, there are many—and especially those who <note type="margin">Generosity must

      another; and they expect to be thought one' generous towards their friends, if they put them
      in the way of getting rich, no matter by what means. Such conduct, however, is so remote from
      moral duty that nothing can be more completely opposed to duty. We must, therefore, take care

      no element of virtue, but its nature is barbarous and revolting to all our finer 'feelings.
      The Stoics, therefore, correctly define courage as that virtue which champions the cause of

      by treachery and cunning; for nothing that lacks justice can be morally right. <note

      even the courage that is prompt to face danger, if it is inspired not by public spirit, but by
      its own selfish purposes, should have the name of effrontery rather than of courage." And so
      we demand that men who are courageous and high-souled shall at the same time be good and
      straightforward, lovers of truth, and foes to deception; for these qualities are the centre
      and soul of justice. </p>

      <note type="margin" n="64">64</note> But the mischief is that from this exaltation and
      greatness of spirit spring all too readily self-will and excessive lust for power. For just as
      Plato tells us that the whole national character of the Spartans was on fire with passion for
      victory, so, in the same way, the more notable a man is for his greatness of spirit, the more
      ambitious he is to be the foremost citizen, or, I should say rather, to be sole ruler. But
      when one begins to aspire to preeminence, it is difficult to preserve that spirit of fairness
      which is absolutely essential to justice. The result is that such men do not allow themselves
      to be constrained either by argument or by any public and lawful authority; but they only too
      often prove to be bribers and agitators in public life, seeking to obtain supreme power and to
      be superiors through force rather than equals through justice. But the greater the difficulty,
      the greater the glory; for no occasion arises that can excuse a man for being guilty of
      injustice. <note type="margin" n="65">65</note> So then, not those who <note type="margin"
       >True greatness of spirit</note>do injury but those who True greatness prevent it are to be
      considered brave and courageous. Moreover, true and philosophic greatness of spirit regards
      the moral goodness to which nature most aspires as consisting in deeds, not in fame, and
      prefers to be first in reality rather than in name. And we must approve this view; for he who
      depends upon the caprice of the ignorant rabble cannot be numbered among the great. Then, too,
      the higher a man's ambition, the more easily he is tempted to acts of injustice by his desire
      for fame. We are now, to be sure, on very slippery ground; for scarcely can the man be found
      who has passed through trials and encountered dangers and does not then wish for glory as a
      reward for his achievements. </p>

      passion or any accident of fortune. The second characteristic is that, when the soul is

      takes a brave and heroic soul to hold as slight what most people think grand and glorious, and
      to disregard it from fixed and settled principles. And it requires strength of character and
      great singleness of purpose to bear what seems painful, as it comes to pass in many and

      there is nothing so characteristic of narrowness and littleness of soul as the love of riches;

     <p> aside all hesitation, enter the race for public office, and take a hand in directing the

      This is easier for the philosophers; as their life is less exposed to the assaults of fortune,
      their wants are fewer; and if any misfortune overtakes them, their fall is not so disastrous.
      Not without reason, therefore, are stronger emotions aroused in those who engage in public
      life than in those who live in retirement, and greater is their ambition for success; the
      more, therefore, do they need to enjoy greatness of spirit and freedom from annoying cares. If
      anyone is entering public life, let him beware of thinking only of the honour that it brings;
      but let him be sure also that he has the ability to succeed. At the same time, let him take
      care not to lose heart too readily through discouragement nor yet to be over-confident through

      avoiding war rather than for the sake of public expediency. War, however, should be undertaken

      the proposal of those who thought he ought to withdraw his fleet from the Arginusae and not to
      risk an engagement with the Athenians. His answer to them was that ." the Spartans could build
      another fleet, if they lost that one, but he could not retreat without dishonour to himself."
      And yet what he did dealt only a slight blow to Sparta; there was another which proved

       type="margin" n="94">94</note> that it is inseparable from moral goodness; for what is proper
      is morally right, and what is morally right is proper. The nature of the difference between
      morality and propriety can be more easily felt than expressed. For whatever propriety may be,
      it is manifested only when there is preexisting moral rectitude. And so, not only in this
      division of moral rectitude which we have now to discuss but also in the three preceding
      divisions, it is clearly brought out what propriety is. For to employ reason and speech <note
       type="margin">Propriety and the Cardinal Virtues</note> rationally, to do with careful
      consideration what ever one does, and in everything to discern the truth and to uphold it—that
      is proper. To be mistaken, on the other hand, to miss the truth, to fall into error, to be led
      astray—that is as improper as to be deranged and lose one's mind. And all things just are
      proper; all things unjust, like all things immoral, are improper. The relation of propriety to
      fortitude is similar. What is done in a manly and courageous spirit seems becoming to a man
      and proper; what is done in a contrary fashion is at once immoral and improper. <note
       type="margin" n="95">95</note>This propriety, therefore, of which I am speaking belongs to

     <p> there is a certain element of propriety perceptible in every act of moral rectitude; and
      this can be separated from virtue theoretically better than it can be practically. As
      comeliness and beauty of person are inseparable from the notion of health, so this propriety
      of which we are speaking, while in fact completely blended with virtue, is mentally and
      theoretically distinguishable from it. <note type="margin" n="96">96</note> The classification

      a general sort of propriety, which is found in moral goodness as a whole; then (2) there is
      another propriety, subordinate to this, which belongs to the several divisions of moral
      goodness. The former is usually defined somewhat as follows: Propriety is that which
      harmonizes with man's superiority in those respects in which his nature differs from that of
      the rest of the animal creation." And they so define the special type of propriety which is
      subordinate to the general notion, that they represent it to be that propriety which
      harmonizes with nature, in the sense that it manifestly embraces temperance and self-control,
      together with a certain deportment such as becomes a gentleman. <note type="margin" n="97"

     <p> that would seem improper, because we are told that they were just men. But when Atreus
      speaks those lines, they call forth applause; for the sentiment is in keeping with the
      character. But it will rest with the poets to decide, according to the individual characters,
      what is proper for each; but to us Nature herself has assigned a character of surpassing
      excellence, far superior to that of all other living creatures, and in accordance with that we
      shall have to decide what propriety requires. <note type="margin" n="98">98</note> The poets
      will observe, therefore, amid a great variety of characters, what is suitable and proper for
      all—even for the bad. But to us Nature <note type="margin">Moral propriety</note>has assigned
      the roles of steadfastness, temperance, self-control, and considerateness of others; Nature
      also teaches us not to be careless in our behaviour towards our fellow-men. Hence we may
      clearly see how wide is the application not only of that propriety which is essential to moral
      rectitude in general, but also of the special propriety which is displayed in each particular
      subdivision of virtue. For, as physical beauty with harmonious symmetry of the limbs engages
      the attention and delights the eye, for the very reason that all the parts combine in harmony
      and grace, so this propriety, which shines out in our conduct, engages the approbation of our

      their feelings; and in this the essence of propriety is best seen. With the foregoing
      exposition, I think it is clear what the nature is of what we term propriety. <note

      but we shall be pursuing that which is in its nature clear-sighted and penetrating (Wisdom),
      that which is adapted to promote and strengthen society (justice), and that which is strong
      and courageous (Fortitude). But the very essence of propriety is found in the division of
      virtue which is now under discussion (Temperance). For it is only when they agree with
      Nature's laws that we should give our approval to the movements not only of the body, but
      still more of the spirit. Now we find that the essential activity of the <note type="margin"

      ὁρμή, in Greek), which impels a man this way and that; the other is reason, which teaches and
      explains what should be done and what should be left undone. The result is that reason
      commands, appetite obeys. XXIX. Again, every action ought to be free from undue haste or

      despise it and cast it from us; but if some one should be found who sets some value upon
      sensual gratification, he must keep strictly within the limits of moderate indulgence. One's
      physical comforts and wants, therefore, should be ordered according to the demands of health
      and strength, not according to the calls of pleasure. And if we will only bear in mind the
      superiority and dignity of our nature, we shall realize how wrong it is to abandon ourselves
      to excess and to live in luxury and voluptuousness, and how right it is to live in thrift,
      self-denial, simplicity, and sobriety. <note type="margin" n="107">107</note> We must realize

      arising from the fact of our being all alike endowed with reason and with that superiority
      which lifts us above the brute. From this all morality and propriety are derived, and upon it
      depends the rational method of ascertaining our duty. The other character is the one that is
      individual assigned to individuals in particular. In the matter endowments-of physical
      endowment there are great differences: some, we see, excel in speed for the race, others in
      strength for wrestling; so in point of personal appearance, some have stateliness, others
      comeliness. <note type="margin" n="108">108</note> Diversities of character are greater still.

     <p> Contemporary with them, Marcus Scaurus and Marcus Drusus, the younger, were examples of
      unusual seriousness; Gaius Laelius, of unbounded jollity; while his intimate friend, Scipio,
      cherished more serious ideals and lived a more austere life. Among the Greeks, history tells
      us, Socrates was fascinating and witty, a genial conversationalist; he was what the Greeks
      call εἴρων—in every conversation, pretending to need information and professing admiration for
      the wisdom of his companion. Pythagoras and Pericles, on the other hand, reached the heights
      of influence and power without any seasoning of mirthfulness. We read that Hannibal, among the
      Carthaginian generals, and Quintus Maximus, among our own, were shrewd and ready at concealing
      their plans, covering up their tracks, disguising their movements, laying stratagems,
      forestalling the enemy's designs. In these qualities the Greeks rank Themistocles and Jason of
      Pherae above all others. Especially crafty and shrewd was the device of Solon, who, to make
      his own life safer and at the same time to do a considerably larger service for his country,
      feigned insanity. <note type="margin" n="109">109</note> Then there are others, quite

      still who will stoop to anything, truckle to anybody, if only they may gain their ends. Such,
      we saw, were Sulla and Marcus Crassus. The most crafty and most persevering man of this type
      was Lysander of Sparta, we are told; of the opposite type was Callicratidas, who succeeded

      well deserved ridicule upon ourselves, so we ought not to introduce anything foreign into our

      predicament, and were the others, who surrendered to Caesar in Africa, in another? And yet,
      perhaps, they would have been condemned, if they had taken their lives; for their mode of life
      had been less austere and their characters more pliable. But Cato had been endowed by nature
      with an austerity beyond belief, and he himself had strengthened it by unswerving consistency

      And as he saw two paths, the path of Pleasure and the path of Virtue, he sat down and debated
      long and earnestly which one it were better for him to take." This might, perhaps, happen to a
      Hercules, scion of the seed of Jove"; but it cannot well happen to us; for we copy, each the
      model he fancies, and we are constrained to adopt their pursuits and vocations. But usually,
      we are so imbued with the teachings of our parents, that we fall irresistibly into their

      by Nature, and the next most powerful by Fortune, we must, of course, take account of them
      both in deciding upon our calling in life; but of the two. Nature claims the more attention.
      For Nature is so much more stable and steadfast, that for Fortune to come into conflict with
      Nature seems like a combat between a mortal and a goddess. If, therefore, anyone has conformed
      his whole plan of life to the kind of nature that is his (that is, his better nature), let him

      included also our concern for the good opinion of those with whom and amongst whom we live.
      For these reasons I should like to say a few words about this kind of propriety also. First of
      all. Nature seems to have had a wonderful plan in the construction of our bodies. Our face and
      our figure generally, in so far as it has a comely appearance, she has placed in sight; but
      the parts of the body that are given us only to serve the needs of nature and that would
      present an unsightly and unpleasant appearance she has covered up and <note type="margin"
       n="127">127</note> concealed from view. Man's modesty has followed <note type="margin"
       >Modesty</note> this careful contrivance of Nature's; all right-minded people keep out of
      sight what Nature has hidden and take pains to respond to nature's demands as privately as
      possible; and in the case of those parts of the body which only serve nature's needs, neither
      the parts nor the functions are called by their real names. To perform these functions—if only
      it be done in private—is nothing immoral; but to speak of them is indecent. And so neither
      public performance of those acts nor vulgar mention of them is free from indecency. </p>

      of discourse to be employed in pleadings in court and speeches in popular assemblies and in

      there are, however, none who make conversation a subject of study, whereas pupils throng about

      Scaurus demolished, and on its site he built an addition to his own house. Octavius, then, was
      the first of his family to bring the honour of a consulship to his house; Scaurus, though the

      with moderation [modestia], derived from moderate; but this is the εὐταξία by which we
      understand orderly conduct. And so, if we may call it also moderation, it is defined by the
      Stoics as follows: Moderation is the science of disposing aright everything that is done or
      said." So the essence of orderliness and of right-placing, it seems, will be the same; for
      orderliness they define also as 1 the arrangement of things in their suitable and appropriate
      places." By place of action," moreover, they mean seasonableness of circumstance; and the
      seasonable circumstance for an action is called in Greek εὐκαιρία, in Latin occasio

       <note type="margin" n="143">143</note> A similar definition can be given for prudence, of
      which I have spoken in an early chapter. But in this part we are considering temperance and
      self-control and related virtues. Accordingly, the properties which, as we found, are peculiar
      to prudence, were discussed in their proper place, while those are to be discussed now which
      are peculiar to these virtues of which we have for some time been speaking and which relate to
      considerateness and to the approbation of our fellow-men. <note type="margin" n="144"

      When Pericles was associated with the poet Sophocles as his colleague in command and they had
      met to confer about official business that concerned them both, a handsome boy chanced to pass
      and Sophocles said: Look, Pericles; what a pretty boy!" How pertinent was Pericles's reply: "
      Hush, Sophocles, a general should keep not only his hands but his eyes under control." And
      yet, if Sophocles had made this same remark at a trial of athletes, he would have incurred no
      just reprimand. So great is the significance of both place and circumstance. For example, if
      anyone, while on a journey or on a walk, should rehearse to himself a case which he is
      preparing to conduct in court, or if he should under similar circumstances apply his closest
      thought to some other subject, he would not be open to censure: </p>

      study and ponder over everything that is worth knowing, still, if the solitude were so
      complete that he could never see a human being, he would die. And then, the foremost of all
      virtues is wisdom—what the Greeks call σοφία; for by prudence, which they call φρόνησις, we
      understand something else, namely, the practical knowledge of things to be sought for and of
      things to be avoided. (2) Again, that wisdom which I have given the foremost place is the
      knowledge of things human and divine, which is concerned also with the bonds of union between
      gods and men and the relations of man to man. If wisdom is the most important of the virtues,
      as it certainly is, it necessarily follows that that duty which is connected with the social
      obligation is the most important duty.<note type="footnote" n="a">a Cicero is guilty of a
       curious fallacy. If it follows from his premises, (1) some one virtue is the highest virtue,
       and (2) the duties derived from the highest virtue are the highest duties, and if (3) wisdom
       is the highest virtue, then it can only follow that the duties derived from wisdom are the
       highest duties. But Cicero throws in a fourth premise that the "bonds of union between gods
       and men and the relations of man to man" are derived from wisdom, and therewith sidetracks
       wisdom and gives the duties derived from the social</note> And (3) service is better than
      mere theoretical knowledge, for the study and knowledge of the universe would somehow be lame
      and defective, were no practical results to follow. Such results, moreover, are best seen in

      their conduct. For who is so absorbed in the investigation and study of creation, but that,
      even though he were working and pondering over tasks never so much worth mastering and even
      though he thought he could number the stars and measure the length and breadth of the
      universe, he would drop all those problems and cast them aside, if word were suddenly brought
      to him of some critical peril to his country, which he could relieve or repel? And he would do
      the same to further the interests of parent or friend or to save him from danger. From all
      this we conclude that the duties prescribed by justice must be given precedence over the
      pursuit of knowledge and the duties imposed by it; for the former concern the welfare of our
      fellow-men; and nothing ought to be more sacred I in men's eyes than that. XLIV. And yet

      better citizens and to render larger service to their country. So, for example, the
      Pythagorean Lysis taught Epaminondas of Thebes; Plato, Dion of Syracuse; and many, many
      others. As for me myself, whatever service I have rendered to my country—if, indeed, I have

      some one to share his studies; he would wish to teach, as well as to learn; to hear, as well
      as to speak. Every duty, therefore, that tends effectively to maintain and safeguard human

      large collection of them; but some of them are so shocking, so indecent, that it seems immoral
      even to mention them. The wise man, therefore, will not think of doing any such thing for the
      sake of his country; no more will his country consent to have it done for her. But the problem
      is the more easily disposed of because the occasion cannot arise when it could be to the
      state's interest to have the wise man do any of those things. 60 This, then, may be regarded
      as settled: in choosing <note type="margin">Order of precedence of duties.</note>between

      inactive) speculation.] So much must suffice for this topic. For, in its essence, it has been
      made so clear, that in determining a question of duty it is not difficult to see which duty is
      to be preferred to any other. Moreover, even in the social relations themselves there are
      gradations of duty so well defined that it can easily be seen which duty takes precedence of
      any other: our first duty is to the immortal gods; our second, to country; our third, to
      parents; and so on, in a descending scale, to the rest. <note type="margin" n="161">161</note>
      From this brief discussion, then, it can be understood that people are often in doubt not only

      moral actions, which one is morally better. This point, as I remarked above, has been

      the task in hand. <note type="margin" n="9">9</note> III. Five principles, accordingly, have
      been laid <note type="margin">Expediency and Moral Rectitude identical.</note>down for the
      pursuance of duty: two of them have to do with propriety and moral rectitude; two, with the
      external conveniences of life—means, wealth, influence; the fifth, with the proper choice, if
      ever the four first mentioned seem to be in conflict. The division treating of moral
      rectitude, then, has been completed, and this is the part with which I desire you to be most
      familiar. The principle with which we are now dealing is that one which is called Expediency.
      The usage of this word has been corrupted and perverted and has gradually come to the point
      where, separating moral rectitude from expediency, it is accepted that a thing may be morally
      right without being expedient, and expedient without being morally right. No more pernicious
      doctrine than this could be introduced into human life. <note type="margin" n="10">10</note>
      There are, to be sure, philosophers of the very highest reputation who distinguish theoretical
      between these three conceptions,1 although they are indissolubly blended together; and they do
      this, I assume, on moral, conscientious principles. [For whatever is just, they hold, is also
      expedient; and in like manner, whatever is morally right is also just. It follows, then, that
      whatever is morally right, is also expedient.] Those who fail to comprehend that 1That is,
      they make a false distinction between (1) moral rectitude that is at the same time expedient;
      (2) moral rectitude that is (apparently) not expedient; and (3) the expedient that is
      (apparently) not morally right. </p>

       >Co-operation us. Fortune</note>power of Fortune for weal and for woe? When we enjoy her
      favouring breeze, we are wafted over to the wished for haven; when she blows against us, we
      are dashed to destruction. Fortune herself, then, does send those other less usual calamities,
      arising, first, from inanimate nature—hurricanes, storms, shipwrecks, catastrophes,
      conflagrations; second, from wild beasts—kicks, bites, and attacks. But these, as I have said,
      are comparatively rare. <note type="margin" n="20">20</note> But think, on the one side, of
      the destruction of armies (three lately, and many others at many different times), the loss of
      generals (of a very able and eminent commander recently), the hatred of the masses, too, and
      the banishment that as a consequence frequently comes to men of eminent services, their
      degradation and voluntary exile; think, on the other hand, of the successes, the civil and
      military honours, and the victories;—though all these contain an element of chance, still they
      cannot be brought about, whether for good or for ill, without the influence and the
      cooperation of our fellow-men. With this understanding of the influence of Fortune, I may
      proceed to explain how we can win the affectionate cooperation of our fellows and enlist it in
      our service. And if the discussion of this point is unduly prolonged, let the length be
      compared </p>

      than love; nothing is more foreign to that end than fear. For Ennius says admirably: " Whom

      discovered, if it was not known before, that no amount of power can withstand the hatred of

      illustrates the deadly effects of popular hatred; and the same lesson is taught by the similar
      fate of all other despots, of whom practically no one has ever escaped such a death. For fear
      is but a poor safeguard of lasting power; while affection, on the other hand, may be trusted
      to keep it safe for ever. <note type="margin" n="24">24</note> But those who keep subjects in
      cheek by force would of course have to employ severity—masters, for example, toward their
      servants, when these cannot be held in control in any other way. But those who in a free state
      deliberately put themselves in a position to be feared are the maddest of the mad. For let the
      laws be never so much overborne by some one individual's power, let the spirit of freedom be
      never so intimidated, still sooner or later they assert themselves either through unvoiced
      public sentiment, or through secret ballots disposing of some high office of state. Freedom

      public life. Furthermore, those who wish to be feared must inevitably be afraid of those whom

      We read in history that he dearly loved his wife Thebe; and yet, whenever he went from the
      banquet hall to her in her chamber, he used to order j a barbarian—one, too, tattooed like a
      Thracian, as ' the records state—to go before him with a drawn sword; and he used to send
      ahead some of his bodyguard to pry into the lady's caskets and to search and see whether some

      more faithful than his own wife! Nor was he mistaken. For he was murdered by her own hand,
      because she suspected him of infidelity. And indeed no power is strong enough to be lasting,
      if it labours under the weight of fear. Witness Phalaris, whose cruelty is notorious beyond
      that of all others. He was slain, not treacherously (like that Alexander whom I named but

       type="margin">The old Republic and the new despotism.</note>illustrations from foreign
      history rather than from our own. Let me add, however, that as long as the empire of the Roman
      People maintained itself by acts of service, not of oppression, wars were waged in the
      interest of our allies or to safeguard our supremacy; the end of our wars was marked by acts
      of clemency or by only a necessary degree of severity; the senate was a haven of refuge for
      kings, tribes, <note type="margin" n="27">27</note> and nations; and the highest ambition of
      our magistrates and generals was to defend our provinces and <note type="margin">(27)</note>
      allies with justice and honour. And so our government could be called more accurately a
      protectorate of the world than a dominion. This policy and practice Ave had begun gradually to
      modify even before Sulla's time; but since his victory Ave have departed from it altogether.
      For the time had gone by when any oppression of the allies could appear wrong, seeing that
      atrocities so outrageous were committed against Roman citizens. In Sulla's case, therefore, an
      unrighteous victory disgraced a righteous cause. For when he had planted his spear <app n="1">

      without whose help our generals have never gained a triumph for their wars beyond the Alps. I

      that spear, when his kinsman was dictator, so again thirty-six years later he did not shrink
      from a still more criminal spear. And still another Sulla, who was a mere clerk under the
      former dictatorship, was under the later one a city quaestor. From this, one would realize
      that, if such rewards are offered, civil wars will never cease to be. And so in Rome only the
      Avails of her houses remain standing—and even they wait now in fear of the most unspeakable

     <p> fore I am speaking here in the popular sense, when I call some men brave, others good, and
      still others wise; for in dealing with popular conceptions we must employ familiar words in
      their common acceptation; and this was the practice of Panaetius likewise. But let us return
      to the subject. <note type="margin" n="36">36</note> The third, then, of the three conditions
      I named <note type="margin">(3) through esteem and admiration</note> as essential to glory is
      that we be accounted worthy of the esteem and admiration of our fellowmen. While people admire
      in general everything that is great or better than they expect, they admire in particular the
      good qualities that they find unexpectedly in individuals. And so they reverence and extol
      with the highest praises those men in whom they see certain preeminent and extraordinary
      talents; and they look down with contempt upon those who they think have no ability, no
      spirit, no energy. For they do not despise all those of whom they think ill. For some men they
      consider unscrupulous, slanderous, fraudulent, and dangerous; they do not despise them, it may
      be; but they do think ill of them. And therefore, as I said before, those are despised who are
      of no use to themselves or their neighbours," as the saying is, who are idle, lazy, and
      indifferent. <note type="margin" n="37">37</note> On the other hand, those are regarded with
      admiration who are thought to excel others in ability and to be free from all dishonour and
      also from those vices which others do not easily resist. For sensual pleasure, a most
      seductive mistress, turns the hearts of the greater part of humanity away from virtue; and
      when the fiery trial of affliction draws near, most people are terrified beyond measure. Life

      circumstances, whether prosperous or adverse, and when some noble and virtuous purpose,

      popularity? above all, on the basis of which alone men are called good men," seems to people
      generally a quite marvellous virtue—and not without good reason; for no one can be just who
      fears death or pain or exile or poverty, or who values their opposites above equity. And
      people admire especially the man who is uninfluenced by money; and if a man has proved himself
      in this direction, they think him tried as by fire. Those three requisites, therefore, which
      were presupposed as the means of obtaining glory, are all secured by justice: (l) good-will,
      for it seeks to be of help to the greatest number; (2) confidence, for the same reason; and
      (3) admiration, because it scorns and cares nothing for those things, with a consuming passion
      for which most people are carried away. <note type="margin" n="39">39</note> Now, in my
      opinion at least, every walk and vocation in life calls for human cooperation—first and above

      easy, unless one is looked upon as a good man. So, even to a man who shuns society and to one

      Captain" should not divide the plunder impartially, he would be either deserted or murdered by
      his comrades. Why, they say that robbers even have a code of laws to observe and obey. And so,
      because of his impartial division of booty, Bardulis, the Illyrian bandit, of whom we read in
      Theopompus, acquired great power, Viriathus, of Lusitania, much greater. He actually defied
      even our armies and generals. But Gaius Laelius—the one surnamed the Wise"—in his praetorship
      crushed his power, reduced him to terms, and so checked his intrepid daring, that he left to
      his successors an easy conquest. Since, therefore, the efficacy of justice is so great that it

      fragile flowers, and nothing counterfeit can be lasting. There are very many witnesses to both
      facts; but for brevity's sake, I shall confine myself to one family: Tiberius Gracchus,
      Publius's son, will be held in honour as long as the memory of Rome shall endure; but his sons

      enable us most easily to secure the reputation of being what we are. For if anyone in his

      that credit accorded to you came to nothing along with the fall of the republic. The subject

      Mucius assisted young Publius Rutilius to gain a reputation for integrity of character and for
      ability as a jurisconsult. Not so, however, Lucius Crassus; for though he was a mere boy, he
      looked to no one else for assistance, but by his own unaided ability he won for himself in
      that brilliant and famous prosecution3 a splendid reputation as an orator. And at an age when
      young men are accustomed with their school exercises to win applause as students of oratory,

      eloquence) counts for more toward the attainment of glory; and yet, it is not easy to say how
      far an affable and courteous manner in conversation may go toward winning the affections. We
      have, for instance, the letters of Philip to Alexander, of Antipater to Cassander, and of
      Antigonus to Philip the Younger. The authors of these letters were, as we are informed, three
      of the wisest men in history; and in them they instruct their sons to woo the hearts of the
      populace to affection by words of kindness and to keep their soldiers loyal by a winning

      they are divided into arguments for the prosecution and arguments for the defemce. And while
      the side of the defence is more honourable, still that of the prosecution also has very often

      the same success. A prosecution brought the eloquence of Publius Sulpicius into favourable
      notice, when he brought an action against Gaius Norbanus, a sediious <note type="margin"

      except in the interest of the state (as in the cases of those above mentioned) or to avenge
      wrongs (as the two Luculli, for example, did) or for the protection of our provincials (as I
      did in the defence of the Sicilians, or Julius in the prosecution of Albucius in behalf of the
      Sardinians). The activity of Lucius Fufius in the impeachment of Manius Aquilius is likewise
      famous. This sort of work, then, may be done once in a lifetime, or at all events not often.
      But if it shall be required of anyone to conduct more frequent prosecutions, let him do it as
      a service to his country; for it is no disgrace to be often employed in the prosecution of her </p>

      also the position of Panaetius, that strictest of Stoics. Then, too, briefs for the defence
      are most likely to bring glory and popularity to the pleader, and all the more so, if ever it

       type="margin">Generosity of two kinds:</note> a young man, in so far as they may be exerted
      for the attainment of glory, I must next in order discuss kindness and generosity. The manner
      of showing it is twofold: kindness is shown to the needy either by personal service, or by
      gifts of money. The latter way is the easier, especially for a rich man; but the former is
      nobler and more dignified and more becoming to a strong and eminent man. For although both
      ways alike betray a generous wish to oblige, still in the one case the favour makes a draft
      upon one's bank account, in the other upon one's personal I energy; and the bounty which is
      drawn from one's material substance tends to exhaust the very fountain of liberality.
      Liberality is thus forestalled by liberality: for the more people one has helped with <note
       type="margin" n="53">53</note> gifts of money, the fewer one can help. But if people are
      generous and kind in the way of personal service—that is, with their ability and personal
      effort—various advantages arise: first, the more people they assist, the more helpers they
      will have in works of kindness; and second, by acquiring the habit of kindness they are better
      prepared and in better training, as it were, for bestowing favours upon many. In one of his
      letters Philip takes his son Alexander sharply to task for trying by gifts of money to secure
      the good-will of the Macedonians: "What in the mischief induced you to entertain such a hope,"

      object. Thus Orestes recently won .great honour by his public dinners given in the streets, on
      the pretext of their being a tithe-offering. Neither did anybody find fault with Marcus Seius
      for supplying grain to the people at an as<note type="footnote" n="a">a The as was a copper

      conclude, the whole system of public bounties in such extravagant amount is intrinsically

     <p> gifts of money, those which are prompted by a spirit of generosity, we ought to look at

      from that of the one who is seeking to better his condition, though <note type="margin" n="62"
       >62</note> he suffers from no actual distress. It will be the duty of charity to incline more
      to the unfortunate, unless, perchance, they deserve their misfortune. But of course we ought
      by no means to withhold our assistance altogether from those who wish for aid, not to save
      them from utter ruin but to enable them to reach a higher degree of fortune. But in selecting
      worthy cases, we ought to use judgment and discretion. For, as Ennius says so admirably, "Good
      deeds misplaced, methinks, are evil deeds." <note type="margin" n="63">63</note> Furthermore,
      the favour conferred upon a man who is good and grateful finds its reward, in such a case, not
      only in his own good-will but in that of others. For when generosity is not indiscriminate
      giving, it wins most gratitude and people praise it with more enthusiasm, because goodness of
      heart in a man of high station becomes the common refuge of everybody. Pains must, therefore,
      be taken to benefit as many as possible with such kindnesses that the memory of them shall be
      handed down to children and to children's children, so that they too may not be ungrateful.
      For all men detest ingratitude and look upon the sin of it as a wrong committed against
      themselves also, because it discourages generosity; and they regard the ingrate as the common

      admiration of one's hearers or the hopes of the distressed or the gratitude of those whom it
      has protected? It was to eloquence, therefore, that our fathers assigned the foremost rank
      among the civil professions. The door of opportunity for generous patronage to others, then,
      is wide open to the orator whose heart is in his work and who follows the custom of our

      compensation. <note type="margin" n="67">67</note> My subject suggests that at this point I

      that people would think that I were complaining on my own account. We see, nevertheless, what
      orators have lost their lives and how few of any promise are left, how far fewer there are who
      have ability, and how many there are who have nothing but presumption. But though not all —no,
      not even many—can be learned in the law or eloquent as pleaders, still anybody may be of
      service to many by canvassing in their support for appointments, by witnessing to their
      character before juries and magistrates, by looking out for the interests of one and another,
      and by soliciting for them the aid of jurisconsults or of advocates. Those who perform such
      services win the most gratitude and find a most extensive sphere for their activities. <note

      will is more inclined to the one from whom we expect a prompter and speedier return. But we
      should observe more carefully how the matter really stands: the poor man of whom we spoke
      cannot return a favour in kind, of course, but if he is a good man he can do it at least in
      thankfulness of heart. As some one has happily said, A man has not repaid money, if he still
      has it; if he has repaid it, he has ceased to have it. But a man still has the sense of
      favour, if he has returned the favour; and if he has the sense of the favour, he has repaid
      it." On the other hand, they who consider themselves wealthy, honoured, the favourites of
      fortune, do not wish even to be put under obligations by our kind services. Why, they actually

      the future —and he needs the help of many; and his own service, if he happens to render any in
      return, he does not exaggerate, but he actually depreciates it. This fact, furthermore, should
      not be overlooked—that if one defends a wealthy favourite of fortune, the favour does not
      extend further than to the man himself or, possibly, to his children. But if one defends a man
      who is poor but honest and upright, all the lowly who are not dishonest—and there is a large
      proportion of that sort among the people—look upon such an advocate as a tower of defence
      raised up for <note type="margin" n="71">71</note> them. I think, therefore, that kindness to
      the good is a better investment than kindness to the favourites of fortune. We must, of

      comes to a conflict of duty on this point, we must, I should say, follow the advice of

     <p> today is demoralized and depraved by our worship of wealth. Of what concern to any one of

      not always even that. But suppose it is; he may, to be sure, have more money to spend; but how
      is he any the better man for that? Still, if he is a good man, as well as a rich one, let not
      his riches be a hindrance to his being aided, if only they are not the motive to it; but in
      conferring favours our decision should depend entirely upon a man's character, not on his
      wealth. The supreme rule, then, in the matter of kindnesses to be rendered by personal service
      is never to take up a case in opposition to the right nor in defence of the wrong. For the

      was enormous—he brought into our treasury so much money <note type="footnote" n="a">a Nearly

      recalled from banishment six hundred exiles who had been the wealthiest men of the city, and
      by his coming made his country free. But he found great difficulty in the matter of property
      and its occupancy; for he considered it most unjust, on the one hand, that those men should be
      left in want whom he had restored and of whose property others had taken possession; and he
      thought it hardly fair, on the other hand, that tenure of fifty years' standing should be
      disturbed. For in the course of that long period many of those estates had passed into
      innocent hands by right of inheritance, many by purchase, many by dower. He therefore decided

      he convinced that it was more to their interest to take a fair price in cash for their lost

      most happily in his book entitled “Oeconomicus.” When I was about your present age, I
      translated it from the Greek into Latin. But this whole subject of acquiring money, investing
      money (I wish I could include also spending money) is more profitably discussed by certain
      worthy gentlemen on " Change" than could be done by any philosophers of any school. For all
      that, we must take cognizance of them; for they come fitly under the head of expediency, and

      against another;—for this, as I stated, is a fourth point overlooked by Panaetius. For not
      only are physical advantages regularly compared with outward advantages [and outward, with
      physical], but physical advantages are compared with one another, and outward with outward.
      Physical advantages are compared with outward advantages in some such way as this: one may ask
      whether it is more desirable to have health than wealth; [external advantages with physical,
      thus: whether it is better to have wealth than extraordinary bodily strength;] while the
      physical advantages may be weighed against one another, so that good health is preferred to
      sensual pleasure, strength to agility. Outward advantages also may be weighed against one
      another: glory, for example, may be preferred to riches, an income derived from city property
      to one derived from the <note type="margin" n="89">89</note> farm. To this class of

      bore the surname of Africanus, has given us the statement that Scipio used to say that he was
      never less idle than when he had nothing to do and never less lonely than when he was alone.
      An admirable sentiment, in truth, and becoming to a great and wise man. It shows that even in
      his leisure hours his thoughts were occupied with public business and that he used to commune
      with himself when alone; and so not only was he never unoccupied, but he sometimes had no need
      for company. The two conditions, then, that prompt others to Idleness— leisure and
      solitude—only spurred him on. I wish I could say the same of myself and say it truly. But if
      by imitation I cannot attain to such excellence of character, in aspiration, at all events, I
      approach it as nearly as I can; for as I am kept by force of armed treason away from practical
      politics and from my practice at the bar, I am now leading a life of leisure. For that reason
      I have left the city and, wandering in the country from place to place, I am often alone.
       <note type="margin" n="2">2</note> But I should not compare this leisure of mine with that of
      Africanus, nor this solitude with his. For he, to find leisure from his splendid services to
      his country, used to take a vacation now and then and to retreat from the assemblies and the
      throngs of men into solitude, as into a haven of rest. But </p>

     <p> my leisure is forced upon me by want of public <note type="margin">The orator's

      has been abolished and the courts have been closed, what is there, in keeping with my
      self-respect, that I can do either in the senate chamber <note type="margin" n="3">3</note> or
      in the forum? So, although I once lived amid throngs of people and in the greatest publicity,
      I am now shunning the sight of the miscreants with whom the world abounds and withdrawing from
      the public eye as far as I may, and I am often alone. But I have learned from philosophers
      that among evils one ought not only to choose the least, but also to extract even from these
      any element of good that they may contain. For that reason, I am turning my leisure to
      account—though it is not such repose as the man should be entitled to who once brought the
      state repose from civil strife—and I am not letting this solitude, which necessity and not my
      will imposes on me, find me idle. <note type="margin" n="4">4</note> And yet, in my judgment,
      Africanus earned the higher praise. For no literary monuments of his genius have been
      published, we have no work produced in his leisure hours, no product of his solitude. From
      this fact we may safely infer that, because of the activity of his mind and the study of those
      problems to which he used to direct his thought, he was never unoccupied, never lonely. But I
      have not strength of mind enough by means of silent meditation to forget my solitude; and so I
      have turned all my attention and endeavour to this kind of literary work. I have, accordingly,
      written more in this short time since the downfall of the republic than I did in the course of
      many years, while the republic stood. </p>

     <p> return to the remaining section of our subject as outlined. <note type="margin" n="7"
       >7</note> Panaetius, then, has given us what is unquestionably <note type="margin">Panaetius
       on Moral Duties</note>the most thorough discussion of moral duties that we have, and I have
      followed him in the main —but with slight modifications. He classifies under three general
      heads the ethical problems which people are accustomed to consider and weigh: first, the
      question whether the matter in hand is morally right or morally wrong; second, whether it is
      expedient or inexpedient; third, how a decision ought to be reached, in case that which has
      the appearance of being morally right clashes with that which seems to be expedient. He has
      treated the first two heads at length in three books; but while he has stated that he meant to
      discuss the third head in its proper <note type="margin" n="8">8</note> turn, he has never
      fulfilled his promise. And I wonder the more at this, because Posidonius, a pupil of his,
      records that Panaetius was still alive thirty years after he published those three books. And
      I am surprised that Posidonius has but briefly touched upon this subject in certain memoirs of
      his, and especially, as he states that there is no other topic in the whole range of
      philosophy so essentially important as this. <note type="margin" n="9">9</note> Now, I cannot
      possibly accept the view of those <note type="margin">Why Panaetius omitted the “Conflict” of
       the moral and the expedient.</note>who say that that point was not overlooked but purposely
      omitted by Panaetius, and that it was not one the moral and that ever needed discussion,
      because there never can be such a thing as a conflict between expediency and moral rectitude.
      But with regard to this assertion, the one point may admit of doubt—whether that question

     <p> but the other point is not open to debate—that it was included in Panaetius's plan but left
      unwritten. For if a writer has finished two divisions of a threefold subject, the third must
      necessarily remain for him to do. Besides, he promises at the close of the third book that he
      will discuss this division also in its <note type="margin" n="10">10</note> proper turn. We
      have also in Posidonius a competent witness to the fact. He writes in one of his letters that
      Publius Rutilius Rufus, who also was a pupil of Panaetius's, used to say that " as no painter
      had been found to complete that part of the Venus of Cos which Apelles had left unfinished
      (for the beauty of her face made hopeless any attempt adequately to represent the rest of the
      figure), so no one, because of the surpassing excellence of what Panaetius did complete, would
      venture to supply what he had left undone." <note type="margin" n="11">11</note>
      <lb/><note type="margin">III.</note>In regard to Panaetius's real intentions, <note
       type="margin">The conflict between Expediency and Moral Rectitude only apparent.</note>
      therefore, no doubt can be entertained. But whether he was or was not justified in adding this
      third division to the inquiry about duty may, perhaps, be a matter for debate. For whether
      moral goodness is the only good, as the Stoics believe, or whether, as your Peripatetics
      think, moral goodness is in so far the highest good that everything else gathered together
      into the opposing scale would have scarcely the slightest weight, it is beyond question that
      expediency can never conflict with moral rectitude. And so, we have heard, Socrates used to
      pronounce a curse upon those who first drew a conceptual distinction between things naturally
      inseparable. With this doctrine the Stoics are in agreement in so far as they maintain that if

     <p> is morally right, it is expedient, and if anything is not morally right, it is not
      expedient. <note type="margin" n="12">12</note> But if Panaetius were the sort of man to say
      that virtue is worth cultivating only because it is productive of advantage, as do certain
      philosophers who measure the desirableness of things by the standard of pleasure or of absence
      of pain, he might argue that expediency sometimes clashes with moral rectitude. But since he
      is a man who judges that the morally right is the only good, and that those things which come
      in conflict with it have only the appearance of expediency and cannot make life any better by
      their presence nor any worse by their absence, it follows that he ought not to have raised a
      question involving the weighing of what seems expedient against <note type="margin" n="13"
       >13</note> what is morally right. Furthermore, when the Stoics speak of the supreme good as
      "living conformably to nature," they mean, as I take it, something like this: that we are
      always to be in accord with virtue, and from all other things that may be in harmony with
      nature to choose only such as are not incompatible with virtue. This being so, some people are
      of the opinion that it was not right to introduce this counterbalancing of right and
      expediency and that no practical instruction should have been given on this question at all.
      And yet moral goodness, in the true and proper sense of the term, is the exclusive possession
      of the wise and can never be separated from virtue; but those who have not perfect wisdom
      cannot possibly have perfect moral goodness, but only a semblance <note type="margin" n="14"
       >14</note> of it. And indeed these duties under discussion in these books the Stoics call

      the estimation of poems, paintings, and a great many other works of art: ordinary people enjoy
      and praise things that do not deserve praise. The reason for this, I suppose, is that those
      productions have some point of excellence which catches the fancy of the uneducated, because
      these have not the ability to discover the points of weakness in any particular piece of work

      morally right. But if Cratippus<note type="footnote" n="a">a As a Peripatetic, Cratippus
       insisted that there was natural good as well as moral good; thus health, honour, etc., were

       (and Cicero is now speaking as a Stoic) called all those other blessings not " good " nor
       "worth seeking for their own sake," but " indifferent."</note> does not permit this
      assumption, you will still grant this at least—that what is morally right is the object most
      worth the seeking for its own sake. Either alternative is sufficient for my purposes; first
      the one and then the other seems to me the more probable; and besides these, there is no other
      alternative that seems probable at all. <note type="footnote" n="b">b With this he waves
       aside, without even the honour of mentioning them, the Epicureans, Cyrenaics, etc,</note>

       type="margin">Vindication of Panaetius: nothing can be expedient that not morally
       right.</note>of Panaetius on this point; for he has said not that the truly expedient could
      under certain circumstances clash with the morally right (for he could right, not have said
      that conscientiously <note type="footnote" n="c">c Because he was a Stoic.</note>), but only
      that what seemed expedient could do so. For he often bears witness to the fact that nothing is
      really expedient that is not at the same time morally right, and nothing morally right that is
      not at the same time expedient; and he says that no greater curse has ever assailed human life
      than the doctrine of those who have separated these two conceptions. And so he introduced an
      apparent, not a real, conflict between them, not to the end that we should under certain
      circumstances give the expedient preference over the moral, but that, in case they ever should
      get in each other's way, we might decide between them without uncertainty. This part,
      therefore, which was passed over by Panaetius, I will carry to completion without any
      auxiliaries, but fighting my own battle, as the saying is. For of all that has been worked out
      on this line since the time of Panaetius, nothing that has come into my hands is at all

      following are problems of this sort: suppose, for example, a time of dearth and famine at
      Rhodes, with provisions at fabulous prices; and suppose that an honest man has imported a
      large cargo of grain from Alexandria and that to his certain knowledge also several other
      importers have set sail from Alexandria, and that on the voyage he has sighted their vessels
      laden with grain and bound for Rhodes; is he to report the fact to the Rhodians or is he to
      keep his own counsel and sell his own stock at the highest market price? I am assuming the
      case of a virtuous, upright man, and I am raising the question how a man would think and
      reason who would not conceal the facts from the Rhodians if he thought that it was immoral to
      do so, but who might be in doubt whether such silence would really be immoral. <note

      could command favours of all classes, called the fishermen together and asked them to do their
      fishing the next day out in front of his villa, and told them what he wished them to do.

      Fimbria, an ex-consul, was judge in a case of Marcus Lutatius Pinthia, a Roman knight of
      irreproachable character. On that occasion Pinthia had laid a wager to be forfeited " if he
      did not prove in court that he was a good man." Fimbria declared that he would never render a
      decision in such a case, for fear that he might either rob a reputable man of his good name,
      if he decided against him, or be thought to have pronounced some one a good man, when such a
      character is, as he said, established by the performance of countless duties and the
      possession of praiseworthy qualities without number. To this type of good man, then, known not

      dare openly to proclaim. Is it not a shame that philosophers should be in doubt about moral
      questions on which even peasants have no doubts at all? For it is with peasants that the

      was commended by the senate. And yet, if the mere show of expediency and the popular
      conception of it are all we want, this one deserter would have put an end to that wasting war
      and to a formidable foe of our supremacy; but it would have been a lasting shame and disgrace

      supremacy is to be sought for the sake of glory, crime should be excluded, for there can be no
      glory in crime; but if it is power for its own sake that is sought, whatever the price, it
      cannot be expedient if it is linked with shame. That well-known measure, therefore, introduced

      they should again be reduced to the condition of tributary states, without repayment on our
      part of the money that they had paid for their exemption. And the senate accepted his
      proposal. Shame upon our government! The pirates' sense of honour is higher than the senate's.

       and the publicans,</note> friend Cato; it seemed to me that he was too rigorous in his
      watchful care over the claims of the treasury and the revenues; he refused everything that the
      farmers of the revenue asked for and much that the allies desired; whereas, as I insisted, it
      was our duty to be generous to the allies and to treat the publicans as we were accustomed
      individually to treat our tenants—and all the more, because harmony between the orders was
      essential to the welfare of the republic. <note type="footnote" n="a">a The publicans, farmers
       of the revenue, were the moneyed men of the times and belonged to the equestrian order. They
       purchased from the senate the farming of the revenues and then sublet their contract to the
       collectors. Sometimes they found that they had agreed to pay too high a rate and petitioned
       the senate to release them from their contract or reduce their obligations, as on this
       occasion (B.C. 61). The opposition of Cato and others strained the relations between the
       senate, who had control of the business, and the equestrian order, driving many of the
       equites over to Caesar's side. Complete harmony between the senate and the knights, as Cicero
       says, was the only thing that could have saved Rome from the popular party and Caesar.</note>
      Curio, too, was wrong, when he <note type="margin">(4) Curio and the colonies.</note> pleaded
      that the demands of the people beyond the Po were just, but never failed to add Let expediency
      prevail." He ought rather to have proved that the claims were not just, because they were not

      you. Thus there are many things which in and of themselves seem morally right, but which under
      certain circumstances prove to be not morally right: to keep a promise, to abide by an
      agreement, to restore a trust »may, with a change of expediency, cease to be morally right.

      discussed wisdom, which cunning seeks to counterfeit, and likewise justice, which is always
      expedient. There remain for our discussion two divisions of moral rectitude, the one of which

     <p> This argument, at all events, has no more weight <note type="margin">(1) An oath is a

      the keeping of any other oath. But in taking an oath Good Faith; it is our duty to consider
      not what one may have to fear in case of violation but wherein its obligation lies: an oath is
      an assurance backed by religious sanctity; and a solemn promise given, as before God as one's
      witness, is to be sacredly kept. For the question no longer concerns the wrath of the gods
      (for there is no such thing) but the obligations of justice and good faith. For, as Ennius
      says so admirably: "Gracious Good Faith, on wings up borne; thou oath in Jupiter's great
      name!" Whoever, therefore, violates his oath violates Good Faith; and, as we find it stated in
      Cato's speech, our forefathers chose that she should dwell upon the Capitol "neighbour to
      Jupiter Supreme and Best." <note type="margin" n="105">105</note> But," objection was further

      evil? Philosophers 3 of the highest authority assure us that pain is not only not the supreme
      evil but no evil at all. And pray do not disparage Regulus, as no unimportant witness—nay, I
      am rather inclined to think he was the very best witness—to the truth of their doctrine. For
      what more competent witness do we ask for than one of the foremost citizens of Rome, who
      voluntarily faced torture for the sake of being true to his moral duty? Again, they say "Of

      very best authorities, states that of the ten eminent nobles who were sent at that time, nine
      returned when their mission failed at the hands of the senate. But one of the ten, who, a
      little while after leaving the camp, had gone back on the pretext that he had forgotten
      something or other, remained behind at Rome; he explained that by his return to the camp he
      was released from the obligation of his oath. He was wrong; for deceit does not remove the
      guilt of perjury—it merely aggravates it. His cunning that impudently tried to masquerade as
      prudence <note type="margin">The ancient Roman discipline.</note>was, therefore, only folly.
      And so the senate ordered that the cunning scoundrel should be taken back to Hannibal in
      chains. <note type="margin" n="114">114</note> But the most significant part of the story is
      this: the eight thousand prisoners in Hannibal's hands were not men that he had taken in the
      battle or that had escaped in the peril of their lives, but men that the consuls Paulus and
      Varro had left behind in camp. Though these might have been ransomed by a small sum of money,
      the senate voted not to redeem them, in order that our soldiers might have the lesson planted
      in their hearts that they must either conquer or die. When Hannibal heard this news, according
      to that same writer, he lost heart completely, because the senate and the people of Rome
      displayed courage so lofty in a time of disaster. Thus apparent expediency is outweighed when

     <p> for enduring pain. They bring even temperance in —not very easily, to be sure, hut still as
      best they can; for they hold that the height of pleasure is found in the absence of pain.
      Justice totters or rather, I should say, lies already prostrate; so also with all those
      virtues which are discernible in social life and the fellowship of human society. For neither
      goodness nor generosity nor courtesy can exist, any more than friendship can, if they are not
      sought of and for themselves, but are cultivated only for the sake of sensual pleasure or
      personal advantage. Let us now recapitulate briefly. <note type="margin" n="119">119</note> As
      I have shown that such expediency as is opposed <note type="margin">Sensual Pleasure and!
       rectitude incompatible.</note> to moral rectitude is no expediency, so I maintain that any
      and all sensual pleasure is opposed to moral rectitude. And therefore Calliphon and
      Dinomachus, in my judgment, deserve the greater condemnation; they imagined that they should
      settle the controversy by coupling pleasure with moral rectitude; as well yoke a man with a
      beast! But moral rectitude does not accept such a union; she abhors it, spurns it. Why, the
      supreme good, which ought to be simple, cannot be a compound and mixture of absolutely
      contradictory qualities. But this theory I have discussed more fully in another connection;
      for the subject is a large one. Now for the matter before us. <note type="margin" n="120"
       >120</note> We have, then, fully discussed the problem how a question is to be decided, if
      ever that which seems to be expediency clashes with moral rectitude. But if, on the other
      hand, the assertion is made that pleasure admits of a show of expediency also, there can still
      be no possible union between it and moral rectitude. For, to make the most generous admission </p>
