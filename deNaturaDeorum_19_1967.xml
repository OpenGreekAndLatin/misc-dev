                        <p>Subject.—In De Natura Deorum Cicero put before Roman readers the
                            theological views of the three schools of philosophy that were of chief
                            importance in his day and in the two preceding centuries, the Epicurean,
                            the Stoic, and the Academic.</p>

                        <p>Post-Aristotelian Philosophy.—In spite of the strong antagonism between
                            the Epicureans and the Stoics, their doctrines had features in common
                            which indeed characterized all the thought of the period. From Aristotle
                            onward Greek philosophy became systematic; it fell into three recognized
                            departments, Logic, Physics, and Ethics, answering the three fundamental
                            questions of the human mind: (1) How do I know the world? (2) What is
                            the nature of the world? (3) The world being what it is, how am I to
                            live in it so as to secure happiness? And in answer to these questions
                            the Stoics and the Epicureans were agreed (1) that the senses are the
                            sole source of knowledge, (2) that matter is the sole reality, and (3)
                            that happiness depends on peace of mind, undisturbed by passions,
                            fears,and desires. But the ethical systems that they based on these
                            first principles were fundamen- <pb n="viii"/> tally opposed; for
                            Epicurus taught that peace of mind is won by liberating the will from
                            nature's law, the Stoics that it comes by submitting to it. Moreover,
                            though both were materialistic, in their detailed systems of nature they
                            differed widely.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div type="commentary" subtype="epicurean_theology">
                        <p>Epicurean Theology.—With both schools alike, Theology fell under the
                            second department of philosophy, Physics. But with Epicurus it was only
                            an appendix to his main theory of nature. This he based upon the atomism
                            of Democritus, holding that the real universe consists in innumerable
                            atoms of matter moving by the force of gravity through an infinity of
                            empty space. Our world and all its contents, and also innumerable other
                            worlds, are temporary clusters of atoms fortuitously collected together
                            in the void; they are constantly forming and constantly dissolving,
                            without plan or purpose. There are gods, because all men believe in them
                            and some men have seen them, and all sensations are true, and so are all
                            beliefs if uncontradicted by sensations. The gods (like everything else)
                            consist of fortuitous clusters of atoms, and our perceptions of them (as
                            of everything else) are caused by atomic films floating off from the
                            surface of their forms and impinging on the atoms of our minds. But it
                            is impious to fancy that the gods are burdened with the labour of
                            upholding or guiding the universe; the worlds go on of themselves, by
                            purely mechanical causation; the gods live a life of undisturbed bliss
                            in the intermundia, the empty regions of space between the worlds.</p>
                    </div>

                        <p>Stoic Theology.—The Stoics, on the contrary, held that the universe is
                            controlled by God, and in the last resort is God. The sole ultimate
                            reality is the divine Mind, which expresses itself in the world-process,
                                <pb n="ix"/> But only matter exists, for only matter can act and be
                            acted upon; mind therefore is matter in its subtlest form, Fire or
                            Breath or Aether. The primal fiery Spirit creates out of itself the
                            world that we know, persists in it as its heat or soul or ' tension,' is
                            the cause of all movement and all life, and ultimately by a universal
                            conflagration will reabsorb the world into itself. But there will be no
                            pause: at once the process will begin again, unity will again pluralize
                            itself, and all will repeat the same course as before. Existence goes on
                            for ever in endlessly recurring cycles, following a fixed law or formula
                            (λόγος); this law is Fate or Providence, ordained by God: the Stoics
                            even said that the ' Logos ' is God. And the universe is perfectly good:
                            badness is only apparent, evil only means the necessary imperfection of
                            the parts viewed separately from the whole. The Stoic system then was
                            determinist: but in it nevertheless they found room for freedom of the
                            will. Man's acts like all other occurrences are the necessary effects of
                            causes; yet man's will is free, for it rests with him either willingly
                            to obey necessity, the divine ordinance, or to submit to it with
                            reluctance. His happiness lies in using his divine intellect to
                            understand the laws of the world, and in submitting his will
                            thereto.</p>

                        <p>ACADEMIC SCEPTICISM and the Later Reaction.— The Academic position in
                            Theology was not dogmatic at all, but purely critical. Within a century
                            of Plato's death his school had been completely transformed by
                            Arccsilas, its head in the middle of the third century B.C.; he imported
                            into it the denial of the possibility of knowledge that had been set up
                            as a philosophical system by the Sceptic Pyrrho two </p>

                        <p> generations before. Arcesilas was regarded as having refounded the
                            school, which was now called the Second or New Academy. Arcesilas's work
                            was carried further a century later by Carneades, who employed his acute
                            logic in demolishing the natural theology of the Stoics. The next head
                            but one, Philo, Cicero's first Academic master, set on foot a reaction
                            to a more dogmatic position; he asserted that the Academy had not really
                            changed its principles since Plato, and that his predecessors, though
                            attacking the ' criterion ' of the Stoics, had not meant to deny all
                            possibility of knowledge: there was a ' clearness ' about some
                            sense-impressions that carried conviction of their truth. Philo's
                            successor Antiochus went further and abandoned scepticism altogether; he
                            maintained that the Academy had lost the true doctrine of Plato, and he
                            professed to recover it, calling his school the ' Old Academy.'</p>

                            under the heads of all the three leading schools, for Philo of the
                            Academy, Diodotus the Stoic, and Phaedrus the Epicurean all came to Rome
                            to escape the disturbances of the Mithridatic War. He gave two more
                            years to study in his maturity; for at the age of twenty-seven he
                            withdrew for a time from public life, spent six months at Athens
                            studying philosophy under the Epicureans Phaedrus and Zeno, and the
                            Academic Antiochus, and then passed on to Rhodes for rhetoric. There he
                            met Posidonius, who was now the leading Stoic, as Diodotus had stayed in
                            Rome as a guest at Cicero's house and resided there till his death. When
                            Cicero went home and resumed his public career, he still continued his
                            studies in his intervals of leisure, as appears <pb n="xi"/> from many
                            passages in his Letters. And when under the Triumvirate his career
                            flagged, he turned more and more to letters. After his return from exile
                            in 57 B.C he wrote De Oratore, De Republica, and De Legibus (his
                            earliest essay in rhetoric, De Inventione, had been written before he
                            was twenty-five). Rhetoric and political science again engaged him on
                            his return to Rome after reconciliation with Caesar in 46 B.C.; and
                            early in 45, after the death of his daughter and the final downfall of
                            Pompey's party at Pharsalus, he retired to a country-house and gave
                            himself entirely to study and to writing. He seems to have conceived the
                            idea of doing a last service to his country by making the treasures of
                            Greek thought accessible to Roman readers. His intention is described in
                            the preface to De Finibus (i. 1-13), in which he commends the book to
                            his friend Brutus; no doubt it was presented to Brutus when he visited
                            Cicero in August (Ad Att. xiii. 44). Cicero went on with his work
                            through the following year, after the assassination of Caesar in March,
                            till in the autumn he flung himself again into the arena by attacking
                            Antony with the Philippics; and this led on to his proscription and his
                            death in December 43. Thus, excepting the treatises named above, the
                            whole of Cicero's important work in the region of thought was
                            accomplished in 46-44 B.C, within the space of two years. Cicero's
                            service to philosophy must not be underrated. In writing to Atticus
                            (xii. 52) he himself took a modest view: ' You will say " What is your
                            method in compositions of this kind? " They are mere transcripts, and
                            cost comparatively little labour; I supply only the words, of which I
                            have a copious flow.' But <pb n="xii"/> elsewhere he rates his work
                            rather higher: ' As my habit is, I shall draw from the fountains of the
                            Greeks at my own judgement and discretion ' (Off. i. 6), and ' I do not
                            merely perform the office of a translator, but apply my own judgement
                            and my own arrangement ' {Fin. i. 6). His method was unambitious: he
                            took some recent handbook of one or other of the leading schools of
                            philosophy and reproduced it in Latin; but he set passages of continuous
                            exposition in a frame of dialogue, and he added illustrations from Roman
                            history and poetry. His object was to popularize among his
                            fellow-countrymen the work of the great masters of thought; and he had
                            made the masters' thought his own, having read widely and having heard
                            the chief teachers of the day. But to learning and enthusiasm he did not
                            add depth of insight or scientific precision. Nevertheless he performed
                            a notable service to philosophy. With the Greek schools it had now
                            fallen into crabbed technicality: Cicero raised it again to literature,
                            so commending it to all men of culture; and he created a Latin
                            philosophic terminology which has passed into the languages of modern
                            Europe.</p>

                        <p>N.D.: Date of Composition.—In the preface to De Divinatione, book ii.,
                            Cicero gives an account of his philosophical authorship. We read there
                            (§ 3) that he finished his three books De Natura Deorum after he had
                            published Tusculan Disputations; and that then, to complete his
                            treatment of the subject, he began De Divinatione, intending to add a
                            treatise De Fato. The preface quoted was written soon after Caesar's
                            death, but the work itself before it (id. § 7), as was De Natura Deorum
                            (see i. 4). Cicero's letter to Atticus dated the Ides of June in 45 B.C.
                            (Att. xiii. 8) shows xii <pb n="xiii"/> him engaged upon the whole
                            subject; he requests Atticus to send him ' Brutus's epitome of the works
                            of Caelius,' which he quotes N.D. ii. 8 and several times in De
                            Divinatione, and ' Philoxenus's copy of Panaetius's Περὶ Προνοίας,'
                            which he follows at Div. ii. 97 and quotes N.D. ii. 118. In a letter to
                            Atticus a little later (xiii. 8. 1) occur the words ' Before dawn, as I
                            was writing against the Epicureans '— a reference to Cotta's speech in
                            Ν.D. i.; and the next day he writes (Att. xiii. 39. 2) ' I am very busy
                            writing; send me . . . Φαίδρου Περὶ Θεῶν'—which he unquestionably
                            required for A^.D. i. He was therefore engaged on this treatise in the
                            summer of 45 B.C, while at the same time occupied on the Tusculans,
                            which he published first.</p>

                        <p>N.D. not completely Finished.—There is no evidence that he ever actually
                            published N.D.; although he speaks of it as ' finished' (Div. ii. 3) it
                            clearly lacks his final touches. The dialogue as it stands is one
                            continuous conversation, ending at nightfall (iii. 94), but traces
                            remain suggesting that it was first cast into three conversations held
                            on three successive days, each book containing one; see ii. 73, " As you
                            said yesterday " (with note ad loc.); iii. 2," I hope you have come well
                            prepared "; iii. 18, "All that you said the day before yesterday to

                        <p>Contents of N.D.—De Natura Deorum opens with a preface dedicating the
                            work to Cicero's friend Brutus. Cicero explains how philosophy occupies
                            his retirement from public life and consoles him in the bereavement of
                            his daughter's death; and how the undogmatic style of the Academic
                            school of thought, of which he was an adherent, was especially suited to
                            the subject of theology. The scene of the dialogue <pb n="xiv"/> is then
                            laid and the characters introduced. The theology of Epicurus is taken
                            first. It is expounded by Velleius (§§ 18-56), who precedes his
                            exposition by a preliminary attack on the theology and cosmogony of
                            Plato and the Stoics, and a refutation (§§ 25-41) of the theology of the
                            other schools from Thales downward. He is answered (§§ 57 to end by the
                            Academic Cotta, who demolishes the Epicurean theology, and pronounces
                            Epicureanism to be really fatal to religion (§ 115)- In Book ii. the
                            Stoic theology is set out by Balbus, who proves (1) the divine existence
                            (§§ 4-44), and expounds (2) the divine nature (§§ 45-72), (3) the
                            providential government of the world (§§ 73-153), and (4) the care of
                            providence for man (§§ 154 to end). Cotta again replies, in Book iii.,
                            giving the Academic criticism of the Stoic theology under the same four
                            heads: (1) §§ 7-19, (2) §§ 20-64, (3) § 65 (the rest of this division is
                            lost), (4) §§ 66 to end.</p>

                        <p>Dramatis Personae.—Thus although as it stands the dialogue is one
                            continuous conversation with the same persons present throughout, it
                            falls into two separate parts, in which two different speakers take the
                            lead; but the rejoinder in both cases is made by Cotta. Velleius the
                            Epicurean speaker and Balbus the Stoic are only known to us from this
                            book, except that De Oratore (iii. 78) gives Velleius as a friend of the
                            orator L. Licinius Crassus, and mentions ' duo Balbi' among the Stoics
                            of the day. Both spokesmen, and also Cotta the Academic, are spoken of
                            here as leaders in their schools (i. 16). Cotta had already been
                            commended to Cicero by Atticus (Att. xiii. 19-3;, and had been mentioned
                            by Cicero before in De Oratore (iii. 145) as having joined the Academy;
                            Cicero <pb n="xv"/> in his youth had listened eagerly to his oratory
                            (Brutus, 305, 317); he had been banished in 90 B.C. under the Varian law
                            (De Or. iii. 11), had returned to Rome 82 B.C. (Brut. 311), and became
                            consul 75 B.C. and then proconsul of Gaul, but died before his triumph.
                            Cicero is almost a κωΦὸν πρόδωπον; in the Introduction (i. 16 f.) he
                            makes a complimentary reply to Cotta's greeting, and one other short
                            remark when Velleius says that as another pupil of Philo he will be a
                            valuable ally for Cotta. Cotta in his reply to the Epicurean exposition
                            asks leave (ii. 104) to quote Cicero's translation of the astronomical
                            poem of Aratus, but Cicero gives his consent by silence. At the close of
                            the work (iii. 95) Cicero ends by noting the impression that the debate
                            had made on his own mind.</p>

                        <p>Supposed Date of the Dialogue.—The imaginary scene of the dialogue may be
                            dated in 77 or 76 B.C. In a list of political murders given by Cotta
                            (iii. 60) the latest is that of Q. Scaevola, which was in 82 B.C. The
                            Stoic professor Posidonius is spoken of as ' the friend of us all' (i.
                            123), which seems to put the scene after 78 B.C. when Cicero heard him
                            lecture at Rhodes (although he had visited Rome on an embassy from
                            Rhodes in 86 B.C.); but there is no reference to Cotta's consulship, 75
                            B.C The date suggested fits in with the reference to P. Vatinius as '
                            adulescens' (ii. 6); he became quaestor in 63 B.C when Cicero was
                            consul.</p>

                        <p>Sources of N.D.—It is of interest to try to ascertain the sources from
                            which Cicero gets his materials for the treatise. In the Epicurean's
                            review of the earlier Greek philosophers (i. 25-41) there are references
                            to their works, and later there are allusions to Epicurus's writings (§
                            43 Περὶ Κριτηρίου ἤ Κανών, ' a heavenly <pb n="xvi"/> volume,' § 49, and
                            §§ 45 and 85 the Κύριαι Δόξαι). But there is nothing to prove that
                            Cicero had read these first-hand authorities, and it is more probable
                            that he followed his usual method of adapting his exposition of each
                            division of his treatise from a single recent writer. For the exposition
                            of Epicureanism which forms the first half of Book i. this was probably
                            a work of his master, Zeno. This conjecture has been supported by a
                            curious accident. Among the papyri discovered at Herculaneum in 1752 is
                            a mutilated Epicurean treatise (fully published in a volume of
                            Herculanensia in 1862); there is reason to assign this to Zeno's pupil,
                            Philodemus; and the fragments are enough to show considerable agreement
                            with N.D. i. The Epicurean argument in N.D. i. has three parts: a
                            general attack on the Platonic and Stoic cosmology, a review of the
                            older philosophers, and an exposition of Epicurean theology. In the
                            papyrus the first part is lost, but it contains the two latter and they
                            correspond very closely with N.D., in spite of some differences; the two
                            books even agree in quotations from Xenophanes, Antisthenes, Aristotle,
                            Chrysippus, and Diogenes of Babylon (N.D. i. §§ 31, 32, 33, 41). Mayor
                            thinks that both books take their topics and arguments from Zeno, the
                            teacher of both authors, and as the historical review in both stops at
                            the middle of the second century Β.C., Zeno's work may well have been
                            based in turn on one by his predecessor Apollodorus. Coming to the
                            Academic Cotta's criticism of Epicureanism in the second half of Book
                            i., the Stoic Posidonius is referred to (i. 123) as ' the friend of us
                            all,' and his work On Nature is quoted as authority for part of the
                            argument, and may be the source of <pb n="xvii"/> the whole; there are
                            Stoic touches throughout (§ 80 the jest at the Academy, § 95 the
                            divinity of the universe, § 100 the teleological argument, § 103 beasts
                            born in fire, § 110 virtue as an active principle, § 115 the definitions
                            of piety and holiness, §121 the union of man and God). But the Stoic
                            origin of the. passage is disputed by some authorities, and it has
                            indeed an Academic colouring: it may possibly come, like Book iii., from
                            Clitomachus, the editor of Carneades, though Carneades is nowhere quoted
                            here as he is in Book iii. For the Stoic system in Book ii. Cicero
                            probably follows Posidonius. He was unlike most of his school (1) in
                            having literary tastes, and using an easy style with historical
                            illustrations, (2) in being interested in science, and (3) in admiring
                            Plato and Aristotle and adapting Stoicism to suit their doctrines. These
                            features are seen in Cicero's exposition: (1) poetic quotations occur in
                            §§ 4, 65, 89, 104-114, 159, and historical illustrations in §§
                            6-11,61,69,165; (2) § 88 refers to the orrery of Posidonius and to
                            astronomical details, tides, the ether, volcanoes, climate, human diet,
                            the kinship of plant, animal, and human life (an Aristotelian touch,
                            conflicting with the older Stoicism), the eternity of the rational soul
                            (which with the early Stoics perished in the universal Conflagration),
                            the origin of civilization (a rationalization of the myth of the Golden
                            Age); (3) Plato is ' the god of philosophers' § 32, and Aristotle is
                            praised §§ 95, 125, and many details are borrowed from him. The source
                            of the Academic criticism of Stoic theology which occupies Book iii. is
                            certainly Hasdrubal of Carthage, better known under his Greek name of
                            Clitomachus. He was born c. 180 B.C and went to <pb n="xviii"/> Athens
                            about the age of twenty-five, becoming the pupil of Carneades and
                            succeeding him as head of the Academy. He left voluminous records of the
                            doctrines of his master, who left none. Carneades was the great source
                            of all criticism of the Stoics, especially of their theology: he ' was
                            fond of tilting at the Stoics,' N.D. ii. 162. The proof of the mortality
                            of all animal life, N.D. iii. 29-34, and the sorites, §§ 43-52, are
                            explicitly taken from Carneades.</p>

                        <p>MSS.—There are many MSS. of Cicero containing De Natura Deorum, but few
                            are old and none earlier than the ninth century. All go back to one
                            archetype, as is proved by errors, gaps, and transpositions common to
                            all; but none seems to have been copied directly from it, and there
                            appear to have been two lines of tradition from it, exemplified by two
                            of the oldest MSS., which must be deemed the most important; both
                            belonged to Voss and are at Leyden— A dating at the end of the ninth or
                            beginning of the tenth century, and B a little later. They have many
                            errors and some considerable gaps in common, but differ in many readings
                            and transpositions. The other superior MSS. all group with A, viz. V
                            (the Palatine, at Vienna, almost of the same date), N (Bibliothèque
                            Nationale, Paris, twelfth century, descended from V), O (Bodleian, end
                            of twelfth century); and so do all the inferior copies. The present
                            edition merely notes at the foot of the page a few of the variants of A
                            and B and of the other MSS. (grouped together as deteriores) in places
                            where the true reading seems doubtful.</p>

                            announced <pb n="xix"/> 1930, ed. minor, 1917). The foundation of modern
                            texts is the edition of Orelli and Baiter (1861), based on five MSS.,
                            three mentioned above, A, B (called by Orelli P) and V, another at
                            Leyden (Heinsianus, twelfth century), and one at Erlangen, E. The
                            invaluable edition of Joseph Mayor (Cambridge, 18801885) also employs
                            evidence collected from twelve other MSS. by various scholars, and the
                            texts of the four editions published at the revival of learning, at
                            Venice (A.D. 1508), Paris (1511), Leipzig (1520), and Basel (1534): the
                            sources of these texts are not entirely known to modern scholars. In
                            addition to his elaborate critical notes Mayor supplies the student with
                            an exhaustive accumulation of explanatory and illustrative commentary.

                        the inquiry into the nature of the gods, which is both highly interesting in

                        well aware. The multiplicity and variety of the opinions held upon this
                        subject by eminent scholars are bound to constitute a strong argument for
                        the view that philosophy has its origin and starting-point in ignorance, and
                        that the Academic School were well-advised in " withholding assent " from
                        beliefs that are uncertain: for what is more unbecoming than ill-considered
                        haste? and what is so ill-considered or so unworthy of the dignity and
                        seriousness proper to a philosopher as to hold an opinion that is not true,
                        or to maintain with unhesitating certainty a proposition not based on

                        of Cyrene held that there are no gods at all. Moreover, the upholders of the
                        divine existence differ and disagree so widely, that it would be a
                        troublesome task to recount their opinions. Many views are put forward about
                        the outward form of the gods, their dwelling-places and abodes, and mode of
                        life, and these topics are debated with the widest variety of opinion among
                        philosophers; but as to the question upon which the whole issue of the
                        dispute principally turns, whether the gods are entirely idle and inactive,
                        taking no part at all in the direction and government of the world, or
                        whether on the contrary all things both were created and ordered by them in
                        the beginning and are controlled and kept in motion by them throughout
                        eternity, here there is the greatest disagreement of all. And until this
                        issue is decided, mankind must continue to labour under the profoundest
                        uncertainty, and to be in ignorance about matters of the highest moment.

                        philosophers who hold that the gods providence, exercise no control over
                        human affairs whatever. But if their opinion is the true one, how can piety,
                        reverence or religion exist? For all these are tributes which it is our duty
                        to render in purity and holiness to the divine powers solely on the
                        assumption that they take notice of them, and that some service has been
                        rendered by the immortal gods to the race of men. But if on the contrary the
                        gods have neither the power nor the will to aid us, if they pay no heed to
                        us at all and take no notice of our actions, if they can exert no possible

                        to the immortal gods? Piety however, like the rest of the virtues, cannot
                        exist in mere outward show and pretence; and, with piety, reverence and
                        religion must likewise disappear. And when these are gone, life soon becomes
                        a welter of disorder and confusion; <note type="margin" n="4">4</note> and
                        in all probability the disappearance of piety towards the gods will entail
                        the disappearance of loyalty and social union among men as well, and of
                        justice itself, the queen of all the virtues. <note type="margin">Belief

                        eminence and note, who believe that the whole world is ruled and governed by
                        divine intelligence and reason; and not this only, but also that the gods'
                        providence watches over the life of men; for they think that the corn and
                        other fruits of the earth, and also the weather and the seasons and the
                        changes of the atmosphere by which all the products of the soil are ripened
                        and matured, are the gift of the immortal gods to the human race; and they
                        adduce a number of things, which will be recounted in the books that compose
                        the present treatise, that are of such a nature as almost to appear to have
                        been expressly constructed by the immortal gods for the use of man. This
                        view was controverted at great length by Carneades, in such a manner as to
                        arouse in persons of active mind a keen desire to discover the truth. <note

                        appease kindly critics and to silence malicious fault-finders, causing the
                        latter to repent of their censure and the former to welcome an accession to
                        their knowledge. Friendly remonstrance must be met by explanation, hostile

                        that a great deal of talk has been current about the large number of books

                        not been all of one kind; some people have been curious as to the cause of
                        this sudden outburst of philosophical interest on my part, while others have
                        been eager to learn what positive opinions I hold on the various questions.
                        Many also, as I have noticed, are surprised at my choosing to espouse a
                        philosophy that in their view robs the world of daylight and floods it with
                        a darkness as of night; and they wonder at my coming forward so unexpectedly
                        as the champion of a derelict system and one that has long been given up.

                        fact however I am no new convert to the study of philosophy. From my
                        earliest youth I have devoted no small amount of time and energy to it, and
                        I pursued it most keenly at the very periods when I least appeared to be
                        doing so, witness the philosophical maxims of which my speeches are full,
                        and my intimacy with the learned men who have always graced my household, as
                        well as those eminent professors, Diodotus, Philo, Antiochus and Posidonius,
                        who were my instructors. <note type="margin" n="7">7</note> Moreover, if it

                        nothing I can explain more easily. I was languishing in idle retirement, and
                        the state of public affairs was such that an autocratic form of government
                        had become inevitable. In these circumstances, in the first place I thought
                        that to expound philosophy to my fellow-countrymen was actually my duty in
                        the interests of the commonwealth, since in my judgement it would greatly
                        contribute to the honour and glory of the state to have thoughts so
                        important and so lofty enshrined in Latin literature also; <note
                            type="margin" n="8">8</note> and I am the less inclined to repent of my
                        undertaking because I can clearly perceive what a number of my readers have
                        been stimulated not only to study but to become authors themselves. A great
                        many accomplished students of Greek learning were unable to share their
                        acquisitions with their fellow-citizens, on the ground that they doubted the
                        possibility of conveying in Latin the teachings they had received from the
                        Greeks. In the matter of style however I believe that we have made such
                        progress that even in richness of vocabulary the Greeks do not surpass us.
                            <note type="margin" n="9">9</note> Another thing that urged me to this
                        occupation was the dejection of spirit occasioned by the heavy and crushing

                        of enjoying even this consolation to the full extent was to devote myself

                        methods in their entirety; since it is a striking characteristic of
                        philosophy that its topics all hang together and form a consecutive system;
                        one is seen to be linked to another, and all to be mutually connected and

                        disposed to approve the practice traditionally ascribed to the Pythagoreans,
                        who, when questioned as to the grounds of any assertion that they advanced
                        in debate, are said to have been accustomed to reply ' He himself said

                        not perish with them, though perhaps they suffer from the loss of their
                        authoritative exponent. Take for example the philosophical method referred </p>

                        positive judgement. This, after being originated by Socrates, revived by
                        Arcesilas, and reinforced by Carneades, has flourished right down to our own
                        period; though I understand that in Greece itself it is now almost bereft of
                        adherents. But this I ascribe not to the fault of the Academy but to the
                        dullness of mankind. If it is a considerable matter to understand any one of
                        the systems of philosophy singly, how much harder is it to master them all!
                        Yet this is the task that confronts those whose principle is to discover the

                        repeated explanations. Our position is not that we hold that nothing is
                        true, but that we assert that all true sensations are associated with false
                        ones so closely resembling them that they contain no infallible mark to
                        guide our judgement and assent.<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite"

                        Member of the Senate, accounted by the Epicureans as their chief Roman
                        adherent at the time. With them was Quintus Lucilius Balbus, who was so
                        accomplished a student of Stoicism as to rank with the leading Greek
                        exponents of that system. When Cotta saw me, he greeted me with the words: "
                        You come exactly at the right moment, for I am just engaging in a dispute
                        with Velleius on an important topic, in which you with your tastes will be

                        have come at the right moment, as you say. For here are you, three leaders
                        of three schools of philosophy, met in congress. In fact we only want Marcus
                        Piso to have every considerable school represented." " Oh," rejoined Cotta,
                        " if what is said in the book which our master Antiochus lately dedicated to
                        our good Balbus here is true, you have no need to regret the absence of your
                        friend Piso. Antiochus holds the view that the doctrines of the Stoics,
                        though differing in form of expression, agree in substance with those of the
                        Peripatetics. I should like to know your opinion of the book, Balbus." " My
                        opinion? " said Balbus, " Why, I am surprised that a man of first-rate
                        intellect like Antiochus should have failed to see what a gulf divides the
                        Stoics, who distinguish expediency and right not in name only but in
                        essential nature, from the Peripatetics, who class the right and the

                        not of kind, between them. This is not a slight verbal discrepancy, but a

                        which we had begun." " Agreed," cried Cotta; " but to let the newcomer know
                        what is the subject of discussion here he glanced at me—" I will explain
                        that we were debating the nature of the gods: a question which seemed to me,
                        as it always does, an extremely obscure one, and upon which I was therefore
                        inquiring of Velleius as to the opinion of Epicurus. So if you do not mind,
                        Velleius," he continued, " please resume the exposition that you had begun."
                        " I will do so," replied Velleius, " although it is not I but you who have
                        been reinforced by an ally— since both of you," he said, with a smile in our

                        nothing." " What we have learned," I rejoined, " shall be Cotta's affair;
                        but pray don't think I have come to act as his ally, but as a listener, and
                        an impartial and unprejudiced listener too, under no sort of bond or
                        obligation willy nilly to uphold some fixed opinion." <note type="margin"

                        advantages, fools can neither avoid their approach nor endure their
                        presence. <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>X. Those on the other hand who
                        said that the world is itself endowed with life and with wisdom, failed
                        entirely to discern what shape the nature of an intelligent living being
                        could conceivably possess. I will touch on this a little later; <note
                            type="margin" n="24">24</note> for the present I will confine myself to
                        expressing my surprise at their stupidity in holding that a being who is
                        immortal and also blessed is of a spherical shape, merely on the ground that
                        Plato pronounces a sphere to be the most beautiful of all figures. For my
                        own part, on the score of appearance I prefer either a cylinder or a cube or
                        a cone or a pyramid. Then, what mode of existence is assigned to their
                        spherical deity? Why, he is in a state of rotation, spinning round with a
                        velocity that surpasses all powers of conception. But what room there can be
                        in such an existence for steadfastness of mind and for happiness, I cannot
                        see. Also, why should a condition that is painful in the human body, if even
                        the smallest part of it is affected, be supposed to be painless in the
                        deity? Now clearly the earth, being a part of the world, is also a part of
                        god. Yet we see that vast portions of the earth's surface are uninhabitable
                        deserts, being either scorched by the sun's proximity, or frost-bound and
                        covered with snow owing to its extreme remoteness. But if the world is god,
                        these, being parts of the </p>

                    <pb n="29"/>
                    <p> world, must be regarded as limbs of god, undergoing the extremes of heat and
                        cold respectively. <note type="margin" n="25">25</note>
                        <note type="margin">Theology of other schools from Thales downward
                            refuted.</note> "So much, Lucilius, for the doctrines of your school. To
                        show what &lt;the older systems&gt; are like, I will trace their history
                        from the remotest of your predecessors. Thales of Miletus, who was the first
                        person to investigate these matters, said that water was the first principle
                        of things, but that god was the mind that moulded all things out of water—
                        supposing that gods can exist without sensation; and why did he make mind an
                        adjunct of water, if mind can exist by itself, devoid of body? The view of
                        Anaximander is that the gods are not everlasting but are born and perish at
                        long intervals of time, and that they are worlds, countless in number. But
                        how can we conceive of god save as living for ever? <note type="margin"
                            n="26">26</note> Next, Anaximenes held that air is god, and that it has
                        a beginning in time, and is immeasurable and infinite in extent, and is
                        always in motion; just as if formless air could be god, especially seeing
                        that it is proper to god to possess not merely some shape but the most
                        beautiful shape; or as if anything that has had a beginning must not
                        necessarily be mortal. <milestone unit="section" n="11"/>XI. Then there is
                        Anaxagoras, the successor of Anaximenes; he was the first thinker to hold
                        that the orderly disposition of the universe is designed and perfected by
                        the rational power of an infinite mind. But in saying this he failed to see
                        that there can be no such thing as sentient and continuous activity in that
                        which is infinite, and that sensation in general can only occur when the
                        subject itself becomes sentient by the impact of a sensation. Further, if he
                        intended his infinite mind to be a definite living creature, it must have
                        some inner principle of life to justify the name. </p>

                    <pb n="31"/>
                    <p> But mind is itself the innermost principle. Mind therefore will have an
                        outer integument of body. <note type="margin" n="27">27</note> But this
                        Anaxagoras will not allow; yet mind naked and simple, without any material
                        adjunct to serve as an organ of sensation, seems to elude the capacity of
                        our understanding. Alcmaeon of Croton, who attributed divinity to the sun,
                        moon and other heavenly bodies, and also to the soul, did not perceive that
                        he was bestowing immortality on things that are mortal. As for Pythagoras,
                        who believed that the entire substance of the universe is penetrated and
                        pervaded by a soul of which our souls are fragments, he failed to notice
                        that this severance of the souls of men from the world-soul means the
                        dismemberment and rending asunder of god; and that when their souls are
                        unhappy, as happens to most men, then a portion of god is unhappy; which is
                        impossible. <note type="margin" n="28">28</note> Again, if the soul of man
                        is divine, why is it not omniscient? Moreover, if the Pythagorean god is
                        pure soul, how is he implanted in, or diffused throughout, the world? Next,
                        Xenophanes endowed the universe with mind, and held that, as being infinite,
                        it was god. His view of mind is as open to objection as that of the rest;
                        but on the subject of infinity he incurs still severer criticism, for the
                        infinite can have no sensation and no contact with anything outside. As for
                        Parmenides, he invents a purely fanciful something resembling a
                        crown—stephanè is his name for it—, an unbroken ring of glowing lights,
                        encircling the sky, which he entitles god; but no one can imagine this to
                        possess divine form, or sensation. He also has many other portentous
                        notions; he deifies war, strife, lust and the like, things which can be
                        destroyed by disease or sleep or forget- </p>

                    <pb n="33"/>
                    <p> fulness or lapse of time; and he also deifies the stars, but this has been
                        criticized in another philosopher and need not be dealt with now in the case
                        of Parmenides. <note type="margin" n="29">29</note>
                        <milestone unit="section" n="12"/>XII. Empedocles again among many other
                        blunders comes to grief most disgracefully in his theology. He assigns
                        divinity to the four substances which in his system are the constituent
                        elements of the universe, although manifestly these substances both come
                        into and pass out of existence, and are entirely devoid of sensation.
                        Protagoras also, who declares he has no clear views whatever about the gods,
                        whether they exist or do not exist, or what they are like, seems to have no
                        notion at all of the divine nature. Then in what a maze of error is
                            Democritus<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a See infra, §
                            120 n.</note> involved, who at one moment ranks as gods his roving '
                        images,' at another the substance that emits and radiates these images, and
                        at another again the scientific intelligence of man! At the same time his
                        denial of immutability, and therefore of eternity, to everything whatsoever
                        surely involves a repudiation of deity so absolute as to leave no conception
                        of a divine being remaining! Diogenes of Apollonia makes air a god; but how
                        can air have sensation, or divinity in any shape? <note type="margin" n="30"
                            >30</note> The inconsistencies of Plato are a long story. In the

                            c.</note> he says that it is impossible to name the father of this

                            vii. 821.</note> he deprecates all inquiry into the nature of the deity.
                            Again,<note type="footnote" n="d">d This sentence should probably follow
                            the next one.</note> he holds that god is entirely incorporeal (in
                        Greek, asomatos); but divine incorporeity is inconceivable, for an
                        incorporeal deity would necessarily be incapable of sensation, and also of
                        practical wisdom, and of pleasure, all of which </p>


                    <pb n="35"/>
                    <p> are attributes essential to our conception of deity. Yet both in the Timaeus
                        and the Laws he says that the world, the sky, the stars, the earth and our
                        souls are gods, in addition to those in whom we have been taught to believe
                        by ancestral tradition; but it is obvious that these propositions are both
                        inherently false and mutually destructive. <note type="margin" n="31"
                            >31</note> Xenophon also commits almost the same errors, though in fewer
                        words; for in his memoir<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a The
                            Memorabilia.</note> of the sayings of Socrates he represents Socrates as
                        arguing that it is wrong to inquire about the form of god, but also as
                        saying that both the sun and the soul are god, and as speaking at one moment
                        of a single god and at another of several: utterances that involve almost
                        the same mistakes as do those which we quoted from Plato. <note

                        entitled The Natural Philosopher, says that while there are many gods of
                        popular belief, there is one god in nature, so depriving divinity of all
                        meaning or substance. Very similarly Speusippus, following his uncle Plato,
                        and speaking of a certain force that governs all things and is endowed with
                        life, does his best to root out the notion of deity from our minds

                        god. But how could the divine consciousness which he assigns to the heavens
                        persist in a state of such rapid motion? Where moreover are all the gods of
                        accepted belief, if we count the heavens also as a god? Again, in
                        maintaining that god is incorporeal, he robs him entirely of sensation, and
                        also of wisdom. Moreover, how is motion possible for an incorporeal being,
                        and how, if he is always in motion, can he enjoy tranquillity and bliss?
                            <note type="margin" n="34">34</note> Nor was his fellow-pupil Xenocrates
                        any wiser on this subject. His volumes On the Nature of the Gods give no
                        intelligible account of the divine form; for he states that there are eight
                        gods: five inhabiting the planets, and in a state of motion; one consisting
                        of all the fixed stars, which are to be regarded as separate members
                        constituting a single deity; seventh he adds the sun, and eighth the moon.
                        But what sensation of bliss these beings can enjoy it is impossible to
                        conceive. Another member of the school of Plato, Heraclides of Pontus,
                        filled volume after volume with childish fictions; at one moment he deems
                        the world divine, at another the intellect; he also assigns divinity to the
                        planets, and holds that the deity is devoid of sensation and mutable of
                        form; and again in the same volume he reckons earth and sky as gods. <note

                        worthy of attention; in his view the sole repository of divine power is
                        nature, which contains in itself the causes of birth, growth and decay, but
                        is entirely devoid of sensation and of form. <note type="margin" n="36"

                        Stoic school. Zeno's view is that the law of nature is divine, and that its
                        function is to command what is right and to forbid the opposite. How he
                        makes out this law to be alive passes our comprehension; yet we undoubtedly
                        expect god to be a living being. In another passage however Zeno declares
                        that the aether is god—if there is any meaning in a god without sensation, a
                        form of deity that never presents itself to us when we offer up our prayers
                        and supplications and make our vows. And in other books again he holds the
                        view that a ' reason ' which pervades all nature<note type="footnote" n="a"
                            place="opposite">a Cf. M. Aurelius v. 32 ὁ διὰ τὴν οὐσίαν διήκων

                        same powers to the stars, or at another time to the years, the months and
                        the seasons. Again, in his interpretation of Hesiod's Theogony (or Origin of
                        the Gods) he does away with the customary and received ideas of the gods
                        altogether, for he does not reckon either Jupiter, Juno or Vesta as gods, or
                        any being that bears a personal name, but teaches that these names have been

                        combat hedonism he babbles like one demented, now imagining gods of some
                        definite shape and form, now assigning full divinity to the stars, now
                        pronouncing that nothing is more divine than reason. The result is that the
                        god whom we apprehend by our intelligence, and desire to make to correspond
                        with a mental concept as a seal tallies with its impression, has utterly and

                        themselves been called by divine names; he did not even say that they were
                        discoveries of the gods, but speaks of them as actually divine. But what
                        could be more ridiculous than to award divine honours to things mean and
                        ugly, or to give the rank of gods to men now dead and gone, whose worship

                        Anyone pondering on the baseless and irrational character of these doctrines
                        ought to regard Epicurus with reverence, and to rank him as one of the very

                        because nature herself has imprinted a conception of them on the minds of
                        all mankind. For what nation or what tribe of men is there but possesses
                        untaught some preconception and bliss, of the gods? Such notions Epicurus
                        designates by the word prolepsis, that is, a sort of preconceived mental
                        picture of a thing, without which nothing can be understood or investigated
                        or discussed. The force and value of this argument we learn in that work of

                        foundation (for such it is) of our inquiry has been well and truly laid. For
                        the belief in the gods has not been established by authority, custom or law,
                        but rests on the unanimous and abiding consensus of mankind; their existence
                        is therefore a necessary inference, since we possess an instinctive or
                        rather an innate concept of them; but a belief which all men by nature share </p>

                    <p> must necessarily be true; therefore it must be admitted that the gods exist.
                        And since this truth is almost universally accepted not only among
                        philosophers but also among the unlearned, we must admit it as also being an
                        accepted truth that we possess a ' preconception,' as I called it above, or
                        ' prior notion,' of the gods. (For we are bound to employ novel terms to
                        denote novel ideas, just as Epicurus himself employed the word prolepsis in
                        a sense in which no one had ever used it before.) <note type="margin" n="45"

                        are eternal and blessed. If this is so, the famous maxim<note

                        being both eternal and supremely blessed, would receive man's pious worship
                        (for what is highest commands the reverence that is its due); and
                        furthermore all fear of the divine power or divine anger would have been

                        for in what other shape do they ever appear to anyone, awake or asleep? But
                        not to make primary concepts the sole test of all things, reason itself
                        delivers the same pronouncement. <note type="margin" n="47">47</note> For it
                        seems appropriate that the being who is the most exalted, whether by reason

                        what disposition of the limbs, what cast of features, what shape or outline
                        can be more beautiful than the human form? You Stoics at least, Lucilius,
                        (for my friend Cotta says one thing at one time and another at another) are
                        wont to portray the skill of the divine creator by enlarging on the beauty
                        as well as the utility of design displayed in all parts of the human figure.
                            <note type="margin" n="48">48</note> But if the human figure surpasses
                        the form of all other living beings, and god is a living being, god must
                        possess the shape which is the most beautiful of all; and since it is agreed
                        that the gods are supremely happy, and no one can be happy without virtue,
                        and virtue cannot exist without reason, and reason is only found in the
                        human shape, it follows that the gods possess the form of man. <note

                        what value can be assigned to a philosophy which thinks that everything

                        not the being and nature of god, and I shall follow the example of
                        Simonides, who having the same question put to him by the great Hiero,
                        requested a day's grace for consideration; next day, when Hiero repeated the
                        question, he asked for two days, and so went on several times multiplying
                        the number of days by two; and when Hiero in surprise asked why he did so,
                        he replied, ' Because the longer I deliberate the more obscure the matter
                        seems to me.' But Simonides is recorded to have been not only a charming
                        poet but also a man of learning and wisdom in other fields, and I suppose
                        that so many acute and subtle ideas came into his mind that he could not
                        decide which of them was truest, and therefore despaired of truth
                        altogether. <note type="margin" n="61">61</note> But as for your master

                        which of his utterances is, I do not say worthy of philosophy, but
                        compatible with ordinary common sense? " In an inquiry as to the nature of

                        as an article of faith merely but as an ascertained fact. For many
                        disturbing reflections occur to my mind, which sometimes make me think that

                        since almost all men, and I myself no less than any other, believe that the
                        gods exist, and this accordingly I do not challenge. At the same time I

                        either accepting these outrageous notions or surrendering the title of the

                        with your school. You advance a paradox, and then, when you want to escape
                        censure, you adduce in support of it some absolute impossibility; so that
                        you would have done better to abandon the point in dispute rather than to
                        offer so shameless a defence. <note type="margin">Doctrine of the swerve
                            absurd;</note> For instance, Epicurus saw that if the atoms travelled
                        downwards by their own weight, we should have no freedom of the will, since
                        the motion of the atoms would be determined by necessity. He therefore
                        invented a device to escape from determinism (the point had apparently
                        escaped the notice of Democritus): he said that the atom while travelling
                        vertically downward by the force of gravity makes a very slight swerve to
                        one side. <note type="margin" n="70">70</note> This defence discredits him
                        more than if he had had to abandon his original position. <note

                        the two alternatives must be true. Epicurus took alarm; if such a
                        proposition as ' Epicurus either will or will not be alive to-morrow' were
                        granted, one or other alternative would be necessary. Accordingly he denied

                        Zeno because, whereas he himself said that all sense-presentations are
                        false, Zeno said that some were false, but not all. Epicurus feared that if
                        a single sensation were admitted to be false, none would be tru e: he
                        therefore said that all the senses give a true report. In none of these
                        cases did he behave very cleverly, for to parry a lighter blow he laid
                        himself open to one that was more severe. <note type="margin" n="71"

                        his writings, he boasted that he had never had a teacher. This I for my part
                        could well believe, even if he did not proclaim it, just as I believe the
                        owner of an ill-built house when he boasts that he did not employ an
                        architect! He shows not the faintest trace of the Academy or the Lyceum, or
                        even of the ordinary schoolboy studies. He might have heard Xenocrates—by

                        he ought to know! He states that he heard a certain Pamphilus, a pupil of
                        Plato, at Samos (where he resided in his youth with his father and
                        brother—his father Neocles had gone there to take up land, but failing to
                        make a living out of his farm, I believe kept a school). <note type="margin"
                            n="73">73</note> However Epicurus pours endless scorn on this Platonist,
                        so afraid is he of appearing ever to have learnt anything from a teacher. He
                        stands convicted in the case of Nausiphancs, a follower of Democritus, whom
                        he does not deny he heard lecture, but whom nevertheless he assails with
                        every sort of abuse. Yet if he had not heard from him these doctrines of
                        Democritus, what had he heard? for what is there in Epicurus's natural
                        philosophy that does not come from Democritus? Since even if he introduced
                        some alterations, for instance the swrerve of the atoms, of which I spoke
                        just now, yet most of his system is the same, the atoms, the void, the
                        images, the infinity of space, and the countless number of worlds, their
                        births and their destructions, in fact almost everything that is comprised
                        in natural science. <note type="margin" n="74">74</note> "As to your formula

                        is that the gods possess a certain outward appearance, which has no firmness
                        or solidity, no definite shape or outline, and which is free from gross
                        admixture, volatile, transparent. Therefore we shall use the same language
                        as we should of the Venus of Cos: her's is not real flesh but the likeness
                        of flesh, and the mantling blush that dyes her fair cheek is not real blood
                        but something that counterfeits blood; similarly in the god of Epicurus we
                        shall say that there is no real substance but something that counterfeits
                        substance. But assume that I accept as true a dogma that I cannot even

                        men: first because our minds possess a preconceived notion of such a
                        character that, when a man thinks of god, it is the human form that presents
                        itself to him; secondly, because inasmuch as the divine nature surpasses all
                        other things, the divine form also must needs be the most beautiful, and no
                        form is more beautiful than that of man. The third reason you advance is
                        that no other shape is capable of being the abode of intelligence. <note

                        doing they had direct access to the divine presence? These notions moreover
                        have been fostered by poets, painters and artificers, who found it difficult
                        to represent living and active deities in the likeness of any other shape
                        than that of man. Perhaps also man's belief in his own superior beauty, to
                        which you referred, may have contributed to the result. But surely you as a
                        natural philosopher are aware what an insinuating go-between and pander of
                        her own charms nature is! Do you suppose that there is a single creature on
                        land or in the sea which does not prefer an animal of its own species to any
                        other? If this were not so, why should not a bull desire to couple with a
                        mare, or a horse with a cow? Do you imagine that an eagle or lion or dolphin
                        thinks any shape more beautiful than its own? Is it then surprising if
                        nature has likewise taught man to think his own species the most beautiful .

                        of the uncivilized races. Among these you will find a belief in certain
                        animals more firmly established than is reverence for the holiest

                        that Juno has one form for the Argives, another for the people of Lanuvium,
                        and another for us. And indeed our Jupiter of the Capitol is not the same as

                        therefore, that is, the explorer and tracker-out of nature, be ashamed to go
                        to minds besotted with habit for evidence of truth? On your principle it
                        will be legitimate to assert that Jupiter always wears a beard and Apollo
                        never, and that Minerva has grey eyes and Neptune blue. Yes, and at Athens
                        there is a much-praised statue of Vulcan made by Alcamenes, a standing
                        figure, draped, which displays a slight lameness, though not enough to be
                        unsightly. We shall therefore deem god to be lame, since tradition
                        represents Vulcan so. Tell me now, do we also make out the gods to have the
                        same names as those by which they are known to us? <note type="margin"

                        a different name in Italy, in Africa and in Spain. Again, the total number
                        of names even in our pontifical books is not great, but there are gods
                        innumerable. Are they without names? You Epicureans at all events are forced
                        to say so, since what is the point of more names when they are all exactly
                        alike? How delightful it would be, Velleius, if when you did not know a
                        thing you would admit your ignorance, instead of uttering this drivel, which

                        divine. " However, as to that, you may take your choice. What I want to know
                        is, how did such a piece of good luck happen (for according to your school

                        earth, and that thus men came into being resembling their sires? I wish that

                        excellence, so also in bodily. Why then, if we are inferior to god in all
                        else, are we his equals in form? for man came nearer to the divine image in

                        us. You claimed it as axiomatic that reason can only exist in human form;
                        but someone else will claim that it can only exist in a terrestrial
                        creature, in one that has been born, has grown up, has been educated,
                        consists of a soul and a body liable to decay and disease—in fine, that it
                        can only exist in a mortal man. If you stand out against each of these
                        assumptions, why be troubled about shape only? Rational intelligence exists
                        in man, as you saw, only in conjunction with all the attributes that I have
                        set out; yet you say that you can recognize god even with all these
                        attributes stripped off, provided that the outward form remains. This is not
                        to weigh the question, it is to toss up for what you are to say. <note

                        single finger too many! Why is this? Because, given five fingers, there is
                        no need of another either for appearance or for use. But your god has got
                        not merely one finger more than he wants, but a head, neck, spine, sides,
                        belly, back, flanks, hands, feet, thighs, legs. If this is to secure him
                        immortality, what have these members to do with life? What has even the
                        face? It depends more on the brain, heart, lungs and liver, for they are the

                        and Minerva in a helmet; but do you therefore believe that those deities are

                        trident, thunderbolt; and if they cannot see what actions the gods perform,
                        yet they cannot conceive of god as entirely inactive. Even the Egyptians,
                        whom we laugh at, deified animals solely on the score of some utility which
                        they derived from them; for instance, the ibis, being a tall bird with stiff
                        legs and a long horny beak, destroys a great quantity of snakes: it protects
                        Egypt from plague, by killing and eating the flying serpents that are
                        brought from the Libyan desert by the south-west wind, and so preventing

                        the cat, but I do not wish to be tedious. I will make my point thus: these
                        animals are at all events deified by the barbarians for the benefits which

                        in pleasure? The poets array banquets of nectar and ambrosia, with Hebe or
                        Ganymede in attendance as cup-bearer; but what will you do, Epicurean? I

                        This theory was chiefly developed by Euhemerus, who was translated and

                        term for friendship is derived. If we base our friendship on its profit to
                        ourselves, and not on its advantage to those whom we love, it will not be
                        friendship at all, but a mere bartering of selfish interests. That is our
                        standard of value for meadows and fields and herds of cattle: we esteem them

                        replied. " I am indeed a rash person," he said, " to attempt to join issue
                        with a pupil of the Academy<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a

                        Academic unversed in rhetoric I should not have been much afraid of, nor yet
                        an orator however eloquent who was not reinforced by that system of
                        philosophy; for I am not disconcerted by a mere stream of empty verbiage,
                        nor yet by subtlety of thought if expressed in a jejune style. You however,
                        Cotta, were strong in both points; you only lacked a public audience and a
                        jury to listen to you. But my answer to your arguments may wait until
                        another time; let us now hear Lucilius, if he himself is agreeable." <note
                            type="margin">2</note> " For my part," rejoined Balbus, " I had rather
                        listen to Cotta again, using the same eloquence that he employed in
                        abolishing false gods to present a picture of the true ones. A philosopher,
                        a pontiff and a Cotta should possess not a shifting and unsettled conception
                        of the immortal gods, like the Academics, but a firm and definite one like
                        our school. As for refuting Epicurus, that has been accomplished and more
                        than accomplished already. But I am eager to hear what you think yourself,
                        Cotta." " Have you forgotten," said Cotta, " what I said at the outset, that
                        I find it more easy, especially on </p>

                        prefer to hear you speak in your turn, now that I have said so much myself."
                        " Well," replied Balbus, " I will yield to your wish; and I shall be as
                        brief as I can, for indeed when the errors of Epicurus have been refuted, my
                        argument is robbed of all occasion for prolixity. <note type="margin"
                            >Division of the subject into four parts.</note> To take a general view,
                        the topic of the immortal gods which you raise is divided by our school into
                        four parts: first they prove that the gods exist; next they explain their
                        nature; then they show that the world is governed by them; and lastly that
                        they care for the fortunes of mankind. In our present discourse however let
                        us take the first two of these heads; the third and fourth, being questions
                        of greater magnitude, had better I think be put off to another time." " No,
                        no," cried Cotta, we are at leisure now, and moreover the subjects which we
                        are discussing might fitly claim precedence even of matters of business."

                        seems not even to require arguing. For when we gaze upward to the sky and
                        contemplate the heavenly bodies, what can be so obvious and so manifest as
                        that there must exist some power possessing transcendent intelligence by
                        whom these things are ruled? Were it not so, how comes it that the words of
                        Ennius carry conviction to all readers— Behold this dazzling vault of
                        heaven, which all mankind as Jove invoke, ay, and not only as Jove but as
                        sovereign of the world, ruling all things with his nod, and as Ennius
                        likewise says— father of gods and men. F </p>

                    <p> a deity omnipresent and omnipotent? If a man doubts this, I really cannot
                        see why he should not also be capable of doubting the existence of the sun;
                            <note type="margin">(2) from the consensus of mankind;</note>
                        <note type="margin">5</note> how is the latter fact more evident than the
                        former? Nothing but the presence in our minds of a firmly grasped concept of
                        the deity could account for the stability and permanence of our belief in
                        him, a belief which is only strengthened by the passage of the ages and
                        grows more deeply rooted with each successive generation of mankind. In
                        every other case we see that fictitious and unfounded opinions have dwindled
                        away with lapse of time. Who believes that the Hippocentaur or the Chimaera
                        ever existed? Where can you find an old wife senseless enough to be afraid
                        of the monsters of the lower world that were once believed in? The years
                        obliterate the inventions of the imagination, but confirm the judgements of
                        nature. " Hence both in our own nation and among all others reverence for
                        the gods and respect for religion grow continually stronger and more
                        profound. <note type="margin">(3) from recorded epiphanies;</note>
                        <note type="margin">6</note> Nor is this unaccountable or accidental; it is
                        the result, firstly, of the fact that the gods often manifest their power in
                        bodily presence. For instance in the Latin War, at the critical battle of
                        Lake Regillus between the dictator Aulus Postumius and Octavius Mamilius of
                        Tusculum, Castor and Pollux were seen fighting on horseback in our ranks.
                        And in more modern history likewise these sons of Tyndareus brought the news
                        of the defeat of Perses. What happened was that Publius Vatinius, the
                        grandfather of our young contemporary, was returning to Rome by night from
                        Reate, of which he was governor, when he was informed by two young warriors
                        on white horses that </p>

                    <pb n="129"/>
                    <p> King Perses had that very day been taken prisoner. When Vatinius carried the
                        news to the Senate, at first he was flung into gaol on the charge of
                        spreading an unfounded report on a matter of national concern; but
                        afterwards a dispatch arrived from Paulus, and the date was found to tally,
                        so the Senate bestowed upon Vatinius both a grant of land and exemption from
                        military service. It is also recorded in history that when the Locrians won
                        their great victory over the people of Crotona at the important battle of
                        the River Sagra, news of the engagement was reported at the Olympic Games on
                        the very same day. Often has the sound of the voices of the Fauns, often has
                        the apparition of a divine form compelled anyone that is not either
                        feeble-minded or impious to admit the real presence of the gods. <note

                        of future events cannot but be taken as proofs that the future may appear or
                        be foretold as a warning or portended or predicted to mankind—hence the very
                        words ' apparition,' 1 warning,' ' portent,' ' prodigy.' Even if we think
                        that the stories of Mopsus, Tiresias, Amphiaraus, Calchas and Helenus are
                        mere baseless fictions of romance (though their powers of divination would
                        not even have been incorporated in the legends had they been entirely
                        repugnant to fact), shall not even the instances from our own native history
                        teach us to acknowledge the divine power? shall we be unmoved by the story
                        of the recklessness of Publius Claudius in the first Punic War? Claudius
                        merely in jest mocked at the gods: when the chickens on being released from
                        their cage refused to feed, he ordered them to be thrown into the water, so
                        that as they would not eat they might drink; but the joke </p>

                        during the same war lose his fleet in a storm after failing to comply with
                        the auspices? In consequence of these disasters Claudius was tried and
                        condemned for high treason and Junius committed suicide. <note type="margin"
                            >8</note> Caelius writes that Gaius Flaminius after ignoring the claims
                        of religion fell at the battle of Trasimene, when a serious blow was
                        inflicted on the state. The fate of these men may serve to indicate that our
                        empire was won by those commanders who obeyed the dictates of religion.
                        Moreover if we care to compare our national characteristics with those of
                        foreign peoples, we shall find that, while in all other respects we are only
                        the equals or even the inferiors of others, yet in the sense of religion,
                        that is, in reverence for the gods, we are far superior. <note type="margin"

                        under the guidance of Attus's augury. But owing to the carelessness of our
                        nobility the augural lore has been forgotten, and the reality of the
                        auspices has fallen into contempt, only the outward show being retained; and

                        that some commanders actually offered themselves as victims to the immortal
                        gods on behalf of the state, veiling their heads and formally vowing
                        themselves to death. I could quote numerous passages from the Sibylline
                        prophecies and from the oracles of soothsayers in confirmation of facts that
                        no one really ought to question. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/> IV. Why,
                        in the consulship of Publius Scipio and Gaius Figulus both our Roman augural
                        lore and that of the Etruscan soothsayers were confirmed by the evidence of
                        actual fact. Tiberius Gracchus, then consul for the second time, was holding
                        the election of his successors. The first returning officer in the very act
                        of reporting the persons named as elected suddenly fell dead. Gracchus
                        nevertheless proceeded with the election. Perceiving that the scruples of
                        the public had been aroused by the occurrence, he referred the matter to the
                        Senate. The Senate voted that it be referred ' to the customary officials.'
                        Soothsayers were sent for, and pronounced that the returning officer for the
                        elections had not been in order. <note type="margin">11</note> Thereupon
                        Gracchus, so my father used to tell me, burst into a rage. ' How now? ' he
                        cried, ' was I not in order? I put the names to the vote as consul, as
                        augur, and with auspices taken. Who are you, Tuscan barbarians,<note

                        elections? ' And accordingly he then sent them about their business.
                        Afterwards however he sent a dispatch from his province to the College of
                        Augurs to say that while reading the sacred </p>

                    <pb n="135"/>
                    <p> books it had come to his mind that there had been an irregularity when he
                        took Scipio's park as the site for his augural tent, for he had subsequently
                        entered the city bounds to hold a meeting of the Senate and when crossing
                        the bounds again on his return had forgotten to take the auspices<note
                            type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a The validity of the military

                        and that therefore the consuls had not been duly elected. The College of
                        Augurs referred the matter to the Senate; the Senate decided that the
                        consuls must resign; they did so. What more striking instances can we
                        demand? A man of the greatest wisdom and I may say unrivalled distinction of
                        character preferred to make public confession of an offence that he might
                        have concealed rather than that the stain of impiety should cling to the
                        commonwealth; the consuls preferred to retire on the spot from the highest
                        office of the state rather than hold it for one moment of time in violation
                        of religion. <note type="margin">12</note> The augur's office is one of high
                        dignity; surely the soothsayer's art also is divinely inspired. Is not one
                        who considers these and countless similar facts compelled to admit that the
                        gods exist? If there be persons who interpret the will of certain beings, it
                        follows that those beings must themselves exist; but there are persons who
                        interpret the will of the god^.; therefore we must admit that the gods
                        exist. But perhaps it may be argued that not all prophecies come true. Nor
                        do all sick persons get well, but that does not prove that there is no art
                        of medicine. Signs of future events are manifested by the gods; men may have

                        evade the captious objections of the rationality Academy; but when they are
                        reduced to brief syllogistic form, as was the practice of Zeno, they lie
                        more open to criticism. A running river can almost or quite entirely escape
                        pollution, whereas an enclosed pool is easily sullied; similarly a flowing
                        stream of eloquence sweeps aside the censures of the critic, but a closely
                        reasoned argument defends itself with difficulty. The thoughts that we
                        expound at length Zeno used to compress into this form: <note type="margin"

                        therefore the world has the faculty of reason.' A similar argument can be
                        used to prove that the world is wise, and happy, and eternal; for things
                        possessed of each of these attributes are superior to things devoid of them,
                        and nothing is superior to the world. From this it will follow that the
                        world is god. Zeno also argued thus: <note type="margin">22</note> ' Nothing
                        devoid of sensation can have a part of itself that is sentient; but the
                        world has parts that are sentient; therefore the world is not devoid of
                        sensation.' He also proceeds to press the argument more closely: ' Nothing,'
                        he says, ' that is inanimate and irrational can give birth to an animate and
                        rational being; but the world gives birth to animate and rational beings;
                        therefore the world is animate and rational.' Furthermore he proved his
                        argument by means of one of his favourite comparisons, as follows: ' If
                        flutes playing musical tunes grew on an olive-tree, surely you would not
                        question that the olive-tree possessed some knowledge of the art of
                        flute-playing; or if plane-trees bore well-tuned lutes, doubtless you would
                        likewise infer that the plane-trees possessed the art of music; why then
                        should we not judge the world to be animate and endowed with wisdom, when it
                        produces animate and wise offspring?' <note type="margin">(12) Arguments

                        definite and uniform motion; and as long as this motion remains within us,
                        so long sensation and life remain, whereas so soon as our heat is cooled and
                        quenched we ourselves perish and are extinguished. <note type="margin"
                            >24</note> This doctrine Cleanthes enforces by these further arguments,
                        to show how great is the supply of heat in every living body: he states that
                        there is no food so heavy that it is not digested in twenty-four hours; and
                        even the residue of our food which nature rejects contains heat. Again, the
                        veins and arteries never cease throbbing with a flame-like pulse, and
                        frequent cases have been observed when the heart of an animal on being torn
                        out of its body has continued to beat with a rapid motion resembling the
                        flickering of fire. Every living thing therefore, whether animal or
                        vegetable, owes its vitality to the heat contained within it. From this it
                        must be inferred that this element of heat possesses in itself a vital force
                        that pervades the whole world. <note type="margin">matter shows signs of

                        neither be frozen into ice by cold nor congealed into snow and hoar-frost
                        unless it could also become fluid when liquefied and thawed by the admixture
                        of heat; this is why moisture both hardens when exposed to a north wind or a
                        frost from some other quarter, and also in turn softens when warmed, and
                        evaporates with heat. Also the sea when violently stirred by the wind
                        becomes warm, so that it can readily be realized that this great body of
                        fluid contains heat; for we must not suppose the warmth in question to be
                        derived from some external source, but stirred up from the lowest depths of
                        the sea by violent motion, just as happens to our bodies when they are
                        restored to warmth by movement and exercise. Indeed the air itself, though
                        by nature the coldest of the elements, is by no means entirely devoid of
                        heat; <note type="margin">27</note> indeed it contains even a considerable
                        admixture of heat, for it is itself generated by exhalation from water,
                        since air must be deemed to be a sort of vaporized water, and this
                        vaporization is caused by the motion of the heat contained in the water. We
                        may see an example of the same process when water is made to boil by placing
                        fire beneath it.—There remains the fourth element: this is itself by nature </p>

                        same or a similar substance, and all the more so because it must be
                        understood that this hot and fiery principle is inter fused with the whole
                        of nature in such a way as to constitute the male and female generative
                        principles, and so to be the necessary cause of both the birth and the

                        possessed of sensation and reason; since every natural object that is not a
                        homogeneous and simple substance but a complex and composite one must
                        contain within it some ruling principle, for example in man the

                        the source of appetition. With trees and plants the ruling principle is
                        believed to be located in the roots. I use the term ' ruling principle ' as
                        the equivalent of the Greek kēgemonikon, meaning that part of anything which
                        must and ought to have supremacy in a thing of that sort. Thus it follows
                        that the element which contains the ruling principle of the whole of nature
                        must also be the most excellent of all things and the most deserving of
                        authority and sovereignty over all things. <note type="margin">30</note> Now
                        we observe that the parts of the world (and nothing exists in all the world

                        is preeminently and perfectly rational, and therefore that the world is god,

                        source and origin of motion. Hence, since all motion springs from the

                        encounter many external obstacles to hinder their perfect realization, but
                        there can be nothing that can frustrate nature as a whole, since she
                        embraces and contains within herself all modes of being. Hence it follows

                        and lastly, endowed with wisdom? How else can it be the best of all things?
                        If it resembles plants or even animals, so far from being highest, it must

                        and animals for the sake of man: for example the horse for riding, the ox

                        came into existence for the purpose of contemplating and imitating the

                        it embraces all things and since nothing exists which is not within it, is

                        kind everything is better than in the imperfect, for instance in a horse
                        than in a foal, in a dog than in a puppy, in a man than in a boy; and that

                        Cleanthes holds to be established by the evidence of two of the senses,

                        that of any fire, inasmuch as it casts its light so far and wide over the
                        boundless universe; and the contact of its rays is so powerful that it not
                        merely warms but often actually burns, neither of which things could it do
                        if it were not made of fire. ' Therefore,' Cleanthes proceeds, ' since the
                        sun is made of fire, and is nourished by the vapours exhaled from the ocean
                        because no fire could continue to exist without sustenance of some sort, it
                        follows that it resembles either that fire which we employ in ordinary life
                        or that which is contained in the bodies of living creatures. <note

                        daily life is a destructive agency, consuming everything, and also wherever
                        it spreads it routs and scatters everything. On the other hand the fire of
                        the body is the glow of life and health; it is the universal preservative,
                        giving nourishment, fostering growth, sustaining, bestowing sensation.' He
                        therefore maintains that there can be no doubt which of the two kinds of

                        and as this has a very rarefied substance and is always in lively motion, it
                        follows that the animal born in this region has the keenest senses and the
                        swiftest power of movement; hence since the stars come into existence in the
                        aether, it is reasonable to suppose that they possess sensation and
                        intelligence. And from this it follows that the stars are to be reckoned as
                        gods. <milestone unit="section" n="16"/> XVI. For it may be observed that
                        the inhabitants of those countries in which the air is pure and rarefied
                        have keener wits and greater powers of understanding than persons who live
                        in a dense and heavy climate; <note type="margin">43</note> moreover the
                        substance employed as food is also believed to have some influence on mental
                        acuteness; it is therefore likely that the stars possess surpassing
                        intelligence, since they inhabit the ethereal region of the world and also
                        are nourished by the moist vapours of sea and earth, rarefied in their
                        passage through the wide intervening space. <note type="margin">(c)
                            intelligence of the stars is shown by their ordered motion which is due

                        for regular and rhythmical motion is impossible without design, which

                        indicates neither a process of nature, for it is highly rational, nor
                        chance, for chance loves variation and abhors regularity; it follows
                        therefore that the stars move of their own free-will and because of their
                        intelligence and divinity. <note type="margin">44</note> Aristotle is also

                        to one of three causes, nature, force, or will; now the sun and moon and all
                        the stars are in motion, and bodies moved by nature travel either downwards
                        owing to their weight or upwards owing to their lightness; but neither (he
                        argued) is the case with the heavenly bodies, because their motion is
                        revolution in a circle; nor yet can it be said that some stronger force
                        compels the heavenly bodies to travel in a manner contrary to their nature,
                        for what stronger force can there be? it remains therefore that the motion
                        of the heavenly bodies is voluntary. " Anyone who sees this truth would show
                        not only ignorance but wickedness if he denied the existence of the gods.
                        Nor indeed does it make much difference whether he denies their existence or
                        deprives them entirely of providential care and of activity; since to my
                        mind an entirely inactive being cannot be said to exist at all. Therefore
                        the existence of the gods is so manifest that I can scarcely deem one who

                        assuming that we have a definite and preconceived idea of a deity as, first,
                        a living being, and secondly, a being unsurpassed in excellence by anything
                        else in the whole of nature, I can see nothing that satisfies this
                        preconception or idea of ours more fully than, first, the judgement that
                        this world, which must necessarily be the most excellent of all things, is
                        itself a living being and a god. <note type="margin">46</note> Let Epicurus
                        jest at this notion as he will—and he is a person who jokes with difficulty,
                        and has but the slightest smack of his native Attic wit,—let him protest his
                        inability to conceive of god as a round and rotating body. Nevertheless he
                        will never dislodge me from one belief which even he himself accepts: he
                        holds that gods exist, on the ground that there must necessarily be some
                        mode of being of outstanding and supreme excellence; now clearly nothing can
                        be more excellent than the world. Nor can it be doubted that a living being
                        endowed with sensation, reason and intelligence must excel a being devoid of
                        those attributes; <note type="margin">47</note> hence it follows that the
                        world is a living being and possesses sensation, intelligence and reason;
                        and this argument leads to the conclusion that the world is god. " But these
                        points will appear more readily a little later merely from a consideration

                        you Epicureans have a criterion of your own! However, assuming that the

                        don't think them so, for what can be more beautiful than the figure that
                        encircles and encloses in itself all other figures, and that can possess no

                        no protuberance or depression? There are two forms that excel all others,
                        among solid bodies the globe (for so we may translate the Greek sphaera),
                        and among plane figures the round or circle, the Greek kyklos; well then,
                        these two forms alone possess the property of absolute uniformity in all
                        their parts and of having every point on the circumference equidistant from

                        darkness now on one side and now on the other; for night is caused merely by

                        Hercules, of Castor and Pollux, of Aesculapius, and also of Liber (I mean
                        Liber the son of Semele, not the Liber whom our ancestors solemnly and
                        devoutly consecrated with Ceres and Libera, the import of which joint
                        consecration may be gathered from the mysteries; but Liber and Libera were
                        so named as Ceres' offspring, that being the meaning of our Latin word
                        liberi—a use which has survived in the case of Libera but not of Liber)—and
                        this is also the origin of Romulus, who is believed to be the same as
                        Quirinus. And these benefactors were duly deemed divine, as being both
                        supremely good and immortal, because their souls survived and enjoyed
                        eternal life. <note type="margin">63</note> " Another theory also, and that

                        explained more fully by Cleanthes and Chrysippus. For example, an ancient
                        belief prevailed throughout Greece that Caelus<note type="footnote" n="a"
                            place="opposite">a i.e., Uranus.</note> was mutilated by bis son Saturn,

                        scientific theory. Their meaning was that the highest element of celestial
                        ether or fire, which by itself generates all things, is devoid of that
                        bodily part which requires union with another for the work of procreation.
                            <milestone unit="section" n="25"/> XXV. By Saturn again they denoted
                        that being who maintains the course and revolution of seasons and periods of
                        time, the deity actually so designated in Greek, for Saturn's Greek name is
                        Kronos, which is the same as chronos, a space of time. The Latin designation
                        ' Saturn ' on the other hand is due to the fact that he is ' saturated ' or
                        1 satiated with years ' (anni); the fable is that he was in the habit of
                        devouring his sons—meaning that Time devours the ages and gorges himself
                        insatiably with the years that are past. Saturn was bound by Jove in order
                        that Time's courses might not be unlimited, and that Jove might fetter him
                        by the bonds of the stars. But Jupiter himself—the name means ' the helping
                        father,' whom with a change of inflexion we style Jove, from iuvare ' to
                        help '; the poets call him ' father of gods and men,' and our ancestors
                        entitled him' best and greatest,' putting the title ' best,' that is most
                        beneficent, before that of 4 greatest,' because universal beneficence is

                        being derived from ire (' to go '), hence the names jani for archways and
                        januae for the front doors of secular buildings. Again, the name Vesta comes
                        from the Greeks, for she is the goddess whom they call Hestia. Her power

                        sacrifices end with this goddess, because she is the guardian of the

                        they reside penitus, in the recesses of the house, owing to which they are
                        also called penetrales by the poets. The name Apollo again is Greek; they

                        manifestation as Lucifera (the light-bringer) among the Greeks. She is also
                        called Diana Omnivaga (wide-wandering), not from her hunting, but because
                        she is counted one it of the seven planets or 1 wanderers ' (vagari). <note
                            type="margin">69</note> She was called Diana because she made a sort of
                        day in the night-time. She is invoked to assist at the birth of children,
                        because the period of gestation is either occasionally seven, or more
                        usually nine, lunar revolutions, and these are called menses (months),

                        Ephesus on the night on which Alexander was born the remark that this need
                        cause no surprise, since Diana was away from home, wishing to be present
                        when Olympias was brought to bed. Venus was so named by our countrymen as
                        the goddess who ' comes ' (venire) to all things; her name is not derived
                        from the word venustas (beauty) but rather venustas from it. <note

                        with the Giants. These stories and these beliefs are utterly foolish; they

                        contempt, we shall nevertheless be able to understand the personality and
                        the nature of the divinities pervading the substance of the several
                        elements, Ceres permeating earth, Neptune the sea, and so on; and it is our
                        duty to revere and worship these gods under the names which custom has
                        bestowed upon them. But the best and also the purest, holiest and most pious
                        way of worshipping the gods is ever to venerate them with purity, sincerity
                        and innocence both of thought and of speech. For religion has been
                        distinguished from superstition not only by philosophers but by our
                        ancestors. <note type="margin">72</note> Persons who spent whole days in
                        prayer and sacrifice to ensure that their children should outlive them were
                        termed ' superstitious ' (from superstes, a survivor), and the word later
                        acquired a wider application. Those on the other hand who carefully reviewed
                        and so to speak retraced all the lore of ritual were called ' religious '
                        from relegere (to retrace or re-read), like ' elegant' from eligere (to
                        select), 'diligent' from diligere (to care for), ' intelligent ' from
                        intellegere (to understand); for all these words contain the same sense of '
                        picking out ' (legere) that is present in ' religious.'<note type="footnote"

                        who rules and governs the universe. But as a matter of fact ' providence '
                        is an elliptical expression; <note type="margin">74</note> when one says '

                        are omitted: so when we speak of the world as governed by providence, you
                        must understand the words ' of the gods ' and must conceive that the full
                        and complete statement would be ' the world is governed by the providence of
                        the gods.' So do not you and your friends waste your wit on making fun of

                        sections. The first is based on the argument proving that the gods exist; if
                        this be granted, it must be admitted that the world is governed by their
                        wisdom. The second proves that all things are under the sway of sentient
                        nature, and that by it the universe is carried on in the most beautiful
                        manner; and this proved, it follows that the universe was generated from
                        living first causes. The third topic is the argument from the wonder that we
                        feel at the marvel of creation, celestial and terrestrial. <note
                            type="margin">(1) Providential government inferred from the divine
                            wisdom and power.</note>
                        <note type="margin">76</note> " In the first place therefore one must either
                        deny the existence of the gods, which in a manner is done by Democritus when
                        he represents them as ' apparitions ' and by Epicurus with his ' images ';
                        or anybody who admits that the gods exist must allow them wisdom and
                        activity, and activity of the most distinguished sort; power now nothing can
                        be more distinguished than the government of the world; therefore the world
                        is governed by the wisdom of the gods. If this is not so, there must clearly
                        be something better and more powerful than god, be it what it may, whether
                        inanimate nature or necessity speeding on with mighty force to create the
                        supremely beautiful objects that we see; <note type="margin">77</note> in
                        that case the nature of the gods is not superior to all else in power,
                        inasmuch as it is subject to a necessity or nature that rules the sky, sea
                        and land. But as a matter of fact nothing exists that is superior to god; it
                        follows therefore that the world is ruled by him; therefore god is not
                        obedient or subject to any form of nature, and therefore he himself rules
                        all nature. In fact if we concede divine intelli- </p>

                    <pb n="199"/>
                    <p> gence, we concede also divine providence, and providence exercised in things
                        of the highest moment. Are then the gods ignorant what things are of the
                        highest moment and how these are to be directed and upheld, or do they lack
                        the strength to undertake and to perform duties so vast? But ignorance is
                        foreign to the divine nature, and weakness, with a consequent incapacity to
                        perform one's office, in no way suits with the divine majesty. This proves
                        our thesis that the world is governed by divine providence. <note
                            type="margin">78</note>
                        <milestone unit="section" n="31"/> XXXI. And yet from the fact of the gods'
                        existence (assuming that they exist, as they certainly do) it necessarily
                        follows that they are animate beings, and not only animate but possessed of
                        reason and united together in a sort of social community or fellowship,
                        ruling the one world as a united commonwealth or state. <note type="margin"
                            >79</note> It follows that they possess the same faculty of reason as
                        the human race, and that both have the same apprehension of truth and the
                        same law enjoining what is right and rejecting what is wrong. Hence we see
                        that wisdom and intelligence also have been derived by men from the gods;
                        and this explains why it was the practice of our ancestors to deify Mind,
                        Faith, Virtue and Concord, and to set up temples to them at the public
                        charge, and how can we consistently deny that they exist with the gods, when
                        we worship their majestic and holy images? And if mankind possesses
                        intelligence, faith, virtue and concord, whence can these things have flowed
                        down upon the earth if not from the powers above? Also since we possess
                        wisdom, reason and prudence, the gods must needs possess them too in greater
                        perfection, and not possess them merely but also exercise them upon matters
                        of the </p>

                    <p> greatest magnitude and value; <note type="margin">80</note> but nothing is
                        of greater magnitude and value than the universe; it follows therefore that
                        the universe is governed by the wisdom and providence of the gods. Finally,
                        since we have conclusively proved the divinity of those beings whose
                        glorious might and shining aspect we behold, I mean the sun and moon and the
                        planets and fixed stars, and the sky and the world itself, and all that
                        mighty multitude of objects contained in all the world which are of great
                        service and benefit to the human race, the conclusion is that all things are
                        ruled by divine intelligence and wisdom. So much for the first division of

                        define nature as a non-rational force that causes necessary motions in

                        method and plainly displaying the means that she takes to produce each

                        handiwork of artist or craftsman can rival or reproduce. For a seed, they
                        point out, has such potency that, tiny though it is in size, nevertheless if
                        it falls into some substance that conceives and enfolds it, and obtains
                        suitable material to foster its nurture and growth, it fashions and produces
                        the various creatures after their kinds, some designed merely to absorb
                        nourishment through their roots, and others capable of motion, sensation,

                        rooted in the earth owe their life and vigour to nature's art, surely the
                        earth herself must be sustained by the same power, inasmuch as when
                        impregnated with seeds she brings forth from her womb all things in
                        profusion, nourishes their roots in her bosom and causes them to grow, and
                        herself in turn is nourished by the upper and outer elements. Her
                        exhalations moreover give nourishment to the air, the ether and all the
                        heavenly bodies. Thus if earth is upheld and invigorated by nature, the same
                        principle must hold good of the rest of the world, for plants are rooted in
                        the earth, animals are sustained by breathing air, and the air itself is our
                        partner in seeing, hearing and uttering sounds, since none of these actions
                        can be performed without its aid; nay, it even moves as we move, for
                        wherever we go or move our limbs, it seems as it were to give place and
                        retire before us. <note type="margin">84</note> And those things which
                        travel towards the centre of the earth which is its lowest point, those
                        which move from the centre upwards, and those which rotate in circles round
                        the centre, constitute the one continuous nature of the world. Again the
                        continuum of the world's nature is constituted by the cyclic transmutations
                        of the four </p>

                    <pb n="205"/>
                    <p> kinds of matter. For earth turns into water, water into air, air into
                        aether, and then the process is reversed, and aether becomes air, air water,
                        and water earth, the lowest of the four. Thus the parts of the world are
                        held in union by the constant passage up and down, to and fro, of these four
                        elements of which all things are composed. <note type="margin">85</note> And
                        this world-structure must either be everlasting in this same form in which
                        we see it or at all events extremely durable, and destined to endure for an
                        almost immeasurably protracted period of time. Whichever alternative be
                        true, the inference follows that the world is governed by nature. For
                        consider the navigation of a fleet, the marshalling of an army, or (to
                        return to instances from the processes of nature) the budding of a vine or
                        of a tree, or even the shape and structure of the limbs of an animal—when do
                        these ever evidence such a degree of skill in nature as does the world
                        itself? Either therefore there is nothing that is ruled by a sentient
                        nature, or we must admit that the world is so ruled. <note type="margin"
                            >86</note> Indeed, how is it possible that the universe, which contains
                        within itself all the other natures and their seeds, should not itself be
                        governed by nature? Thus if anyone declared that a man's teeth and the hair
                        on his body are a natural growth but that the man himself to whom they
                        belong is not a natural organism, he would fail to see that things which
                        produce something from within them must have more perfect natures than the
                        things which are produced from them. <milestone unit="section" n="34"/>

                        things that nature governs, their trainer and nourisher, is the world; the
                        world gives nutriment and sustenance to all its limbs as it were, or parts.

                    <pb n="207"/>
                    <p> of the world are governed by nature, the world itself must needs be governed
                        by nature. Now the government of the world contains nothing that could
                        possibly be censured; given the existing elements, the best that could be
                        produced from them has been produced. <note type="margin">The world's
                            perfection must be the work of intelligence (that of a divine

                        <note type="margin">87</note> Let someone therefore prove that it could have
                        been better. But no one will ever prove this, and anyone who essays to
                        improve some detail will either make it worse or will be demanding an
                        improvement impossible in the nature of things. " But if the structure of
                        the world in all its parts is such that it could not have been better
                        whether in point of utility or beauty, let us consider whether this is the
                        result of chance, or whether on the contrary the parts of the world are in
                        such a condition that they could not possibly have cohered together if they
                        were not controlled by intelligence and by divine providence. If then the
                        products of nature are better than those of art, and if art produces nothing
                        without reason, nature too cannot be deemed to be without reason. When you
                        see a statue or a painting, you recognize the exercise of art; when you
                        observe from a distance the course of a ship, you do not hesitate to assume
                        that its motion is guided by reason and by art; when you look at a sun-dial
                        or a water-clock, you infer that it tells the time by art and not by chance;
                        how then can it be consistent to suppose that the world, which includes both
                        the works of art in question, the craftsmen who made them, and everything
                        else besides, can be devoid of purpose and of reason? <note type="margin"

                        being, and debate whether it is the product of chance or necessity of some
                        sort, or of divine reason and intelligence; they think more highly of the
                        achievement of Archimedes in making a model of the revolutions of the
                        firmament than of that of nature in creating them, although the perfection

                        current as Latin. The air in turn is embraced by the immeasurable aether,

                        of atoms rushing to and fro fortuitously and at random? or could any other
                        being devoid of intelligence and reason have created them? Not merely did
                        their creation postulate intelligence, but it is impossible to understand
                        their nature without intelligence of a high order. <note type="margin">The

                        marvellous, but nothing is more remarkable than the stability and coherence
                        of the world, which is such that it is impossible even to imagine anything
                        better adapted to endure. For all its parts in every direction gravitate
                        with a uniform pressure towards the centre. Moreover bodies conjoined
                        maintain their union most permanently when they have some bond encompassing
                        them to bind them together; and this function is fulfilled by that rational
                        and intelligent substance which pervades the whole world as the efficient
                        cause of all things and which draws and collects the outermost particles
                        towards the centre. <note type="margin">116</note> Hence if the world is
                        round and therefore all its parts are held together by and with each other
                        in universal equilibrium, the same must be the case with the earth, so that
                        all its parts must converge towards the centre (which in a sphere is the
                        lowest point) without anything to break the continuity and so threaten its
                        vast complex of gravitational forces and masses with dissolution. And on the
                        same principle the sea, although above the earth, nevertheless seeks the
                        earth's centre and so is massed into a sphere uniform on all sides, and
                        never floods its bounds and overflows. <note type="margin">117</note> Its

                        raise themselves erect like animals. Nay more, it is said that if planted

                        has provided with bounteous plenty for each species of animal that food
                        which is suited to it. I might show in detail what provision has been made
                        in the forms of the animals for appropriating and assimilating this food,
                        how skilful and exact is the disposition of the various parts, how
                        marvellous the structure of the limbs. For all the organs, at least those
                        contained within the body, are so formed and so placed that none of them is
                        superfluous or not necessary for the preservation of life. <note
                            type="margin">122</note> But nature has also bestowed upon the beasts
                        both sensation and desire, the one to arouse in them the impulse to
                        appropriate their natural foods, the other to enable them to distinguish
                        things harmful from things wholesome. Again, some animals approach their
                        food by walking, some by crawling, some by flying, some by swimming; and
                        some seize their nutriment with their gaping mouth and with the teeth
                        themselves, others snatch it in the grasp of their claws, others with their
                        curved beaks, some suck, others graze, some swallow it whole, others chew
                        it. Also some are of such lowly stature that they easily reach their food
                        upon the ground with their jaws; <note type="margin">123</note> whereas the
                        taller species, such as geese, swans, cranes and camels, are aided by the
                        length of their necks; the elephant is even provided with a hand, because
                        his body is so large that it was difficult for him to reach his food.

                    <pb n="241"/>
                    <p> there was bestowed even a sort of craft or cunning: for instance, one
                        species of the spider tribe weaves a kind of net, in order to dispatch
                        anything that is caught in it; another in order to . . . stealthily keeps
                        watch, and, snatching anything that falls into it, devours it. The mussel,
                        or pina as it is called in Greek, is a large bivalve which enters into a
                        sort of partnership with the tiny shrimp to procure food, and so, when
                        little fishes swim into the gaping shell, the shrimp draws the attention of
                        the mussel and the mussel shuts up its shells with a snap<note

                        curious to know whether their association is due to a sort of mutual
                        compact, or whether it was brought about by nature herself and goes back to
                        the moment of their birth. Our wonder is also considerably excited by those
                        aquatic animals which are born on land—crocodiles, for instance, and
                        water-tortoises and certain snakes, which are born on dry land but as soon
                        as they can first crawl make for the water. Again we often place ducks' eggs
                        beneath hens, and the chicks that spring from the eggs are at first fed and
                        mothered by the hens that hatched and reared them, but later on they leave
                        their foster-mothers, and run away when they pursue them, as soon as they
                        have had an opportunity of seeing the water, their natural home. So powerful
                        an instinct of self-preservation has nature implanted in living creatures.

                        habit of gorging itself with shell-fish, which it digests by means of the
                        heat of its stomach and then brings up again, and so picks out from them the
                        parts that are good to eat. <note type="margin">125</note> Sea-frogs again
                        are said to be in the habit of covering themselves with sand and creeping
                        along at the water's edge, and then when fishes approach them thinking they
                        are something to eat, these are killed and devoured by the frogs. The kite
                        and the crow live in a state of natural war as it were with one another, and
                        therefore each destroys the other's eggs wherever it finds them. Another
                        fact (observed by Aristotle, from whom most of these cases are cited) cannot
                        but awaken our surprise, namely that cranes when crossing the seas on the
                        way to warmer climates fly in a triangular formation. With the apex of the
                        triangle they force aside the air in front of them, and then gradually on

                            wild geese and swans, saying a tergo sensim dilatante se cuneo
                            porrigitur agmen, ' the column widens out at the rear with the gradual

                        the birds' onward flight is sustained, while the base of the triangle formed
                        by the cranes gets the assistance of the wind when it is so to speak astern.
                        The birds rest their necks and heads on the backs of those flying in front
                        of them; and the leader, being himself unable to do this as he has no one to
                        lean on, flies to the rear that he himself also may have a rest, while one
                        of those already rested takes his place, and so they keep turns throughout

                        up what are called the doorways of the liver with the middle intestine. From
                        the liver different channels pass in different directions, and through these

                        the breath itself and then by contact with the lungs; part of it is returned
                        by the act of respiration, and part is received by a certain part of the
                        heart, called the cardiac ventricle, adjacent to which is a second similar

                        the function of distinguishing the flavours of our various viands, is
                        situated in that part of the face where nature has made an aperture for the
                        passage of food and drink. The sense of touch is evenly diffused over all
                        the body, to enable us to perceive all sorts of contacts and even the
                        minutest impacts of both cold and heat. And just as architects relegate the
                        drains of houses to the rear, away from the eyes and nose of the masters,
                        since otherwise they would inevitably be somewhat offensive, so nature has
                        banished the corresponding organs of the body far away from the
                        neighbourhood of the senses. <note type="margin">142</note>

                        order that nothing may impinge upon them and to open them; and nature has
                        provided that this process can be repeated again and again with extreme

                        the eyes for seeing, they may be as it were tucked up for repose. Moreover
                        the eyes are in an advantageously retired position, and shielded on all
                        sides by surrounding prominences; for first the parts above them are covered
                        by the eyebrows which prevent sweat from flowing down from the scalp and

                        from sleep. The auditory passage is winding, to prevent anything from being
                        able to enter, as it might if the passage were clear and straight; it has

                        being lost before they strike the sense. The apertures of the ears are hard
                        and gristly, and much convoluted, because things with these qualities
                        reflect and amplify sound; this is why tortoise-shell or horn gives
                        resonance to a lyre, and also why winding passages and enclosures have an
                        echo which is louder than the original sound. <note type="margin">145</note>

                        that may harm them; and they are always moist, which is useful to guard them
                        against dust and many other things. The sense of taste is admirably
                        shielded, being enclosed in the mouth in a manner well suited for the

                        devoid of these very faculties. While discussing this topic I could wish,
                        Cotta, that I had the gift of your eloquence. How could not you describe
                        first our powers of understanding, and then our faculty of conjoining
                        premisses and consequences in a single act of apprehension, the faculty I
                        mean that enables us to judge what conclusion follows from any given
                        propositions and to put the inference in syllogistic form, and also to
                        delimit particular terms in a succinct definition; whence we arrive at an
                        understanding of the potency and the nature of knowledge, which is the most
                        excellent part even of the divine nature. Again, how remarkable are the
                        faculties which you Academics invalidate and abolish, our sensory and

                        Then take the gift of speech, the queen of arts as you are fond of calling
                        it—what a glorious, what a divine faculty it is! In the first place it
                        enables us both to learn things we do not know and to teach things we do
                        know to others; secondly it is our instrument for exhortation and
                        persuasion, for consoling the afflicted and assuaging the fears of the
                        terrified, for curbing passion and quenching appetite and anger; it is this
                        that has united us in the bonds of justice, law and civil order, this that
                        has separated us from savagery and barbarism. <note type="margin">149</note>
                        Now careful consideration will show that the mechanism of speech displays a
                        skill on nature's part that surpasses belief. In the first place there is an
                        artery passing from the lungs to the back of the mouth, which is the channel
                        by which the voice, originating from the mind, is caught and uttered. Next,
                        the tongue is placed in the mouth and confined by the teeth; it modulates
                        and defines the inarticulate flow of the voice and renders its sounds
                        distinct and clear by striking the teeth and other parts of the mouth.
                        Accordingly my school is fond of comparing the tongue to the quill of a
                        lyre, the teeth to the strings, and the nostrils to the horns which

                        ease, and to perform every motion without difficulty. Thus by the
                        manipulation of the fingers the hand is enabled to paint, to model, to

                        spectacle for man to behold; for there is no sight of which it is more

                        know when the seasons will come round, and when their variations and changes
                        will occur; and if these things are known to men alone, they must be judged
                        to have been created for the sake of men. <note type="margin">The vegetable

                        say that lyres and flutes were made for the sake of those who can use them,
                        so it must be agreed that the things of which I have spoken have been
                        provided for those only who make use of them, and even if some portion of
                        them is filched or plundered by some of the lower animals, we shall not
                        admit that they were created for the sake of these animals also. Men do not
                        store up corn for the sake of mice and ants but for their wives and children
                        and households; so the animals share these fruits of the earth only by
                        stealth as I have said, whereas their masters enjoy them openly and freely.
                            <note type="margin">158</note> It must therefore be admitted that all

                        only of its flavour but also of its scent and appearance lead us to doubt
                        whether nature intended this gift for man alone! <note type="margin">and the

                        without man's care and tendance. Then think of the dog, with its trusty

                        of Epicurus so much as the art of prophecy; but in my view it affords the
                        very strongest proof that man's welfare is studied by divine providence. I
                        refer of course to Divination, which we see practised in many regions and
                        upon various matters and occasions both private and more especially public.

                        the human race and bring it gradually down to smaller and smaller groups,
                        and finally to single individuals. <milestone unit="section" n="66"/> LXVI.
                        For if we believe, for the reasons that we have spoken of before, that the

                        lands remote from this continent in which we dwell, then they care also for
                        the men who inhabit with us these lands between the sunrise and the sunset.
                            <note type="margin">165</note> But if they care for these who inhabit
                        that sort of vast island which we call the round earth, they also care for
                        those who occupy the divisions of that island, Europe, Asia and Africa.
                        Therefore they also cherish the divisions of those divisions, for instance
                        Rome, Athens, Sparta and Rhodes; and they cherish the individual citizens of
                        those cities regarded separately from the whole body collectively, for
                        example, Curius, Fabricius and Coruncanius in the war with Pyrrhus,
                        Calatinus, Duellius, Metellus and Lutatius in the First Punic War, and
                        Maximus, Marcellus and Africanus in the Second, and at a later date Paulus,

                            replies, denying divination altogether.</note> And the same is proved by
                        the portents of future occurrences that are vouchsafed to men sometimes when
                        they are asleep and sometimes when they are awake. Moreover we receive a
                        number of warnings by means of signs and of the entrails of victims, and by
                        many other things that long-continued usage has noted in such a manner as to

                            <note type="margin">2</note> Hereupon Velleius broke in: " You cannot
                        think, Cotta," said he, " how eager I am to hear you. Our good friend Balbus
                        enjoyed your discourse against Epicurus; so I in my turn will give you an

                        Because I think that your master Epicurus does not put up a very strong
                        fight on the question of the immortal gods; he only does not venture to deny
                        their existence so that he may not encounter any ill-feeling or reproach.

                        I am sure you must have noticed how much he had to say, and how though
                        lacking in truth it was yet consistent and systematic. Hence what I have in
                        mind, as I said, is not so much to refute his discourse as to ask for an
                        explanation of the things that I could not quite understand. Accordingly, I
                        offer you the choice, Balbus, whether you would prefer that I should
                        question you and you reply upon each of the points singly as to which I did
                        not quite agree, or that you should hear out my entire discourse." " Oh,"
                        answered Balbus, " I had rather reply about any point which you desire to
                        have explained to you; or if you want to question me with a view not so much
                        to understanding as to refuting me, I will do whichever you wish, and will
                        either reply to each of your inquiries at once, or answer them all when you
                        have completed your speech. <note type="margin">5</note> " Very well,"

                        let me say a few words about myself. I am considerably influenced by your
                        authority, Balbus, and by the plea that you put forward at the conclusion of
                        your discourse, when you exhorted me to remember that I am both a Cotta and
                        a pontiff. This no doubt meant that I ought to uphold the beliefs about the
                        immortal gods which have come down to us from our ancestors, and the rites
                        and ceremonies and duties of religion. For my part I always shall uphold
                        them and always have </p>

                        dislodge me from the belief as to the worship of the immortal gods which I
                        have inherited from our forefathers. But on any question of religion I am
                        guided by the high pontiffs, Titus Coruncanius, Publius Scipio and Publius
                        Scaevola, not by Zeno or Cleanthes or Chrysippus; and I have Gaius Laelius,
                        who was both an augur and a philosopher, to whose discourse upon religion,
                        in his famous oration,<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a Laelius

                        The religion of the Roman people comprises ritual, auspices, and the third
                        additional division consisting of all such prophetic warnings as the
                        interpreters of the Sybil or the soothsayers have derived from portents and
                        prodigies. Well, I have always thought that none of these departments of
                        religion was to be despised, and I have held the conviction that Romulus by
                        his auspices and Numa by his establishment of our ritual laid the
                        foundations of our state, which assuredly could never have been as great as
                        it is had not the fullest measure of divine favour been obtained for it.

                        reflected at all about the immortal gods. Accept me as a pupil who is a

                        nevertheless discoursed at such great length on that very point." " It was
                        because I have often noticed that you too, Cotta, when speaking in court,
                        overwhelmed the judge with all the arguments you could think of, provided
                        the case gave you an opportunity to do so. Well, the Greek philosophers do
                        likewise, and so did I also, to the best of my ability. But for you to ask
                        me this question is just the same as if you were to ask me why I look at you

                        good," rejoined Cotta, " is a question that I will leave to you. As a matter
                        of fact in law-suits it is not my practice to argue a point that is
                        self-evident and admitted by all parties, for argument would only diminish
                        its clearness; and besides, if I did do this in pleading cases in the
                        courts, I should not do the same thing in an abstract discussion like the
                        present. But there would be no real reason for your shutting one eye, since
                        both eyes have the same field of vision, and since the nature of things,
                        which you declare to be possessed of wisdom, has willed that we should
                        possess two windows pierced from the mind to the eyes. You did not really
                        feel confident that the doctrine of the divine existence was as self-evident
                        as you could wish, and for that reason you attempted to prove it with a
                        number of arguments. For my part a single argument would have sufficed,
                        namely that it has been handed down to us by our forefathers. But you
                        despise authority, and fight your battles with the weapon of reason. <note

                        issue with yours. " You adduce all these arguments to prove that the gods
                        exist, and by arguing you render doubtful a matter which in my opinion
                        admits of no doubt at all. <note type="margin">Not true that the sight of

                        every day. Then is anybody content that questions of such moment should be
                        decided by the beliefs of the foolish? and particularly yourselves, who say

                        battle of the Locrians on the Sagra. Then do you really think that the
                        beings whom you call the sons of Tyndareus, that is mortal men of mortal
                        parentage, and whom Homer, who lived not long after their period, states to
                        have been buried at Sparta, came riding on white hacks with no retainers,
                        and met Vatinius, and selected a rough countryman like him to whom to bring
                        the news of a great national victory, instead of Marcus Cato, who was the
                        chief senator at the time? Well then, do you also believe that the mark in

                        the Sagra, the Greeks actually have a proverbial saying about it: when they

                        like the Decii? No, the sacrifice of the Decii was a device of generalship,
                        or stratēgēma as it is termed in Greek, though a device for generals who
                        were ready to give their lives in their country's service; their notion was

                        not? As for the remaining reasons adduced by Cleanthes, the one derived from
                        the abundance of the commodities bestowed upon us, and the other from the
                        ordered sequence of the seasons and the regularity of the heavens, we will
                        treat of these when we come to discuss divine providence, about which you,

                        passed without remark—such as divination, and fate, subjects which you
                        dismiss very briefly, whereas our school is accustomed to say a great deal

                        spoken about the first part, let us consider the second. It seems to me to
                        have amounted to this: you intended to show what the gods are like, but you
                        actually showed them to be non-existent. For you said that it is very
                        difficult to divert the mind from its association with the eyes; yet you did
                        not hesitate to argue that, since nothing is more excellent than god, the
                        world must be god, because there is nothing in the universe superior to the
                        world. Yes, if we could but imagine the world to be alive, or rather, if we
                        could but discern this truth with our minds exactly as we see external
                        objects with our eyes! <note type="margin">21</note> But when you say that
                        nothing is superior to the world, what do you mean by superior? If you mean
                        more beautiful, I agree; if more suited to our convenience, I agree to that
                        too; but if what you mean is that nothing is wiser than the world, I
                        entirely and absolutely disagree; not because it is difficult to divorce the
                        mind from the eyes, but </p>

                    <p> because the more I do so, the less my mind succeeds in grasping your

                        to our city; but you do not therefore think that our city possesses a
                        reasoning, thinking mind? or, because it does not, you do not therefore
                        consider, do you, that an ant is to be rated more highly than this supremely
                        beautiful city, on the ground that a city does not possess sensation whereas
                        an ant has not only sensation, but also a mind that reasons and remembers?
                        You ought to see what you can get your opponent to admit, Balbus, not take
                        for granted anything you like. <note type="margin">Zeno proves too

                        syllogism of Zeno. Zeno puts the argument thus: ' That which is rational is
                        superior to that which is not rational; but nothing is superior to the
                        world; therefore the world is rational.' <note type="margin">23</note> If
                        you accept this conclusion, you will go on to prove that the world is
                        perfectly able to read a book; for following in Zeno's footsteps you will be
                        able to construct a syllogism as follows: ' That winch is literate is
                        superior to that which is illiterate; but nothing is superior to the world;
                        therefore the world is literate.' By this mode of reasoning the world will
                        also be an orator, and even a mathematician, a musician, and in fact an
                        expert in every branch of learning, in fine a philosopher. You kept
                        repeating that the world is the sole source of all created things, and that
                        nature's capacity does not include the power to create things unlike
                        herself: am I to admit that the world is not only a living being, and wise,
                        but also a harper and a flute-player, because it gives birth also to men

                    <p> Well then, your father of the Stoic school really adduces no reason why we
                        should think that the world is rational, or even alive. Therefore the world
                        is not god; and nevertheless there is nothing superior to the world, for
                        there is nothing more beautiful than it, nothing more conducive to our

                        argues thus: ' If anything exists that man is not capable of creating, he
                        that creates that thing is superior to man; but man is not capable of
                        creating the objects that we see in the world; therefore he that was capable
                        of so doing surpasses man; but who could surpass man save god? therefore god
                        exists.' The whole of this is involved in the same mistake as the argument
                        of Zeno; <note type="margin">26</note> no definition is given of the meaning
                        of ' superior ' and ' more excellent,' or of the distinction between nature
                        and reason. Chrysippus furthermore declares that, if there be no gods, the
                        natural universe contains nothing superior to man; but for any man to think
                        that there is nothing superior to man he deems to be the height of
                        arrogance. Let us grant that it is a mark of arrogance to value oneself more
                        highly than the world; but not merely is it not a mark of arrogance, rather
                        is it a mark of wisdom, to realize that one is a conscious and rational
                        being, and that Orion and Canicula are not. Again, he says ' If we saw a
                        handsome mansion, we should infer that it was built for its masters and not
                        for mice; so therefore we must deem the world to be the mansion of the
                        gods.' Assuredly I should so deem it if I thought it had been built like a
                        house, and not constructed by nature, as I shall show that it was.<note

                        indiscerptible nor incapable of decomposition and dissolution. And every
                        living thing is by its nature capable of feeling; therefore there is no

                        Therefore likewise, if every living thing can be cut up into parts, no
                        living thing is indivisible, and none is everlasting. But every living thing

                        change; but the elements of which, according to your school, all things are
                        composed are liable to change; therefore every body is liable to change. But
                        if any body were not liable to death, then not every body would be liable to

                        of these elements or some of them; but none of these elements is exempt from
                        destruction; <note type="margin">31</note> for everything of an earthy
                        nature is divisible, and also liquid substance is soft and therefore easily

                        impacts of all kinds, and are of a consistency that is extremely yielding
                        and easily dissipated; and besides, all these elements perish when they
                        undergo transmutation, which occurs when earth turns into water, and when
                        from water arises air, and from air aether, and when alternately the same
                        processes are reversed; but if those elements of which every living thing

                        appetition and avoidance; but the objects of appetition are the things which
                        are in accordance with nature, and the objects of avoidance are the
                        contrary; and every living thing seeks certain things and flees from certain
                        things, but that which it flees from is contrary to nature, and that which
                        is contrary to nature has the power of destruction; therefore every living

                        my part do not understand how organisms should perish if their heat is

                        than air (anima), of which also the soul (animus) of animate beings
                        consists, from which the term ' animate ' is derived? On what ground
                        moreover do you take it for granted that there is no soul except fire? It
                        seems more reasonable to hold that soul is of a composite nature, and
                        consists of fire and air combined. <note type="margin">but if it is the

                        goddesses? if the nymphs are, the Pans and Satyrs also are gods; but they
                        are not gods; therefore the nymphs also are not. Yet they possess temples
                        vowed and dedicated to them by the nation; are the other gods also therefore
                        who have had temples dedicated to them not gods either? Come tell me
                        further: you reckon Jupiter and Neptune gods, therefore their brother Orcus
                        is also a god; and the fabled streams of the lower world, Acheron, Cocytus
                        and Pyriphlegethon, and also Charon and also Cerberus are to be deemed gods.
                            <note type="margin">44</note> No, you say, we must draw the line at
                        that; well then, Orcus is not a god either; what are you to say about his
                        brothers then? ' These arguments were advanced by Carneades, not with the
                        object of establishing atheism (for what could less befit a philosopher?)

                    <p> in order to prove the Stoic theology worthless; accordingly he used to
                        pursue his inquiry thus: ' Well now,' he would say, ' if these brothers are
                        included among the gods, can we deny the divinity of their father Saturn,
                        who is held in the highest reverence by the common people in the west? And
                        if he is a god, we must also admit that his father Caelus is a god. And if
                        so, the parents of Caelus, the Aether and the Day, must be held to be gods,
                        and their brothers and sisters, whom the ancient genealogists name Love,
                        Guile, Fear, Toil, Envy, Fate, Old Age, Death, Darkness, Misery,
                        Lamentation, Favour, Fraud, Obstinacy, the Parcae, the Daughters of
                        Hesperus, the Dreams: all of these are fabled to be the children of Erebus
                        and Night.' Either therefore you must accept these monstrosities or you must
                        discard the first claimants also. <note type="margin">45</note>

                        Mercury and the rest gods, will you have doubts about Hercules, Aesculapius,
                        Liber, Castor and Pollux? But these are worshipped just as much as those,
                        and indeed in some places very much more than they. Are we then to deem
                        these gods, the sons of mortal mothers? Well then, will not Aristaeus, the
                        reputed discoverer of the olive, who was the son of Apollo, Theseus the son
                        of Neptune, and all the other sons of gods, also be reckoned as gods? What
                        about the sons of goddesses? I think they have an even better claim; for
                        just as by the civil law one whose mother is a free woman is a freeman, so
                        by the law of nature one whose mother is a goddess must be a god. And in the
                        island of Astypalaea Achilles is most devoutly worshipped by the inhabitants
                        on these grounds; but if Achilles is a god, so are Orpheus and Rhesus, whose
                        mother was a </p>

                        a marriage on dry land! If these are not gods, because they are nowhere
                        worshipped, how can the others be gods? <note type="margin">46</note> Is not
                        the explanation this, that divine honours are paid to men's virtues, not to
                        their immortality? as you too, Balbus, appeared to indicate. Then, if you
                        think Latona a goddess, how can you not think that Hecate is one, who is the
                        daughter of Latona's sister Asteria? Is Hecate a goddess too? we have seen
                        altars and shrines belonging to her in Greece. But if Hecate is a goddess,
                        why are not the Eumenides? and if they are goddesses,—and they have a temple
                        at Athens, and the Grove of Furina at Rome, if I interpret that name aright,
                        also belongs to them,—then the Furies are goddesses, presumably in their
                        capacity of detectors and avengers of crime and wickedness. <note

                        can you give why we should not include Isis and Osiris in the same category?
                        And if we do so, why should we repudiate the gods of the barbarians? We

                        worshipped at the Roman colony of Circei. If you therefore deem her divine,
                        what answer will you give to Medea, who, as her father was Aeetes and her
                        mother Idyia, had as her two grandfathers the Sun and Oceanus? or to her
                        brother Absyrtus (who appears in Pacuvius as Aegialeus, though the former
                        name is commoner in ancient literature)? if these are not divine, I have my
                        fears as to what will become of Ino, for the claims of all of them derive
                        from the same source. <note type="margin">49</note> Or if we allow Ino, are
                        we going to make Amphiaraus and Trophonius divine? The Roman tax-farmers,
                        finding that lands in Boeotia belonging to the immortal gods were exempted
                        by the censor's regulations, used to maintain that nobody was immortal who
                        had once upon a time been a human being. But if these are divine, so
                        undoubtedly is Erechtheus, whose shrine and whose priest also we saw when at
                        Athens. And if we make him out to be divine, what doubts can we feel about
                        Codrus or any other persons who fell fighting for their country's freedom?
                        if we stick at this, we must reject the earlier cases too, from which these

                        was there that Stratonicus uttered one of his many witty sayings; some
                        person obnoxious to him swore that Alabandus was divine and Hercules was
                        not: ' Well and good,' said Stratonicus, ' let the wrath of Alabandus fall
                        on me and that of Hercules on you.' <note type="margin">51</note>

                        the sky and stars, do you not see what a long way this takes you? You say
                        that the sun and moon are deities, and the Greeks identify the former with
                        Apollo and the latter with Diana. But if the Moon is a goddess, then Lucifer
                        also and the rest of the planets will have to be counted gods; and if so,
                        then the fixed stars as well. But why should not the glorious Rainbow be
                        included among the gods? it is beautiful enough, and its marvellous
                        loveliness has given rise to the legend that Iris is the daughter of
                            Thaumas.<note type="footnote" n="b">b From θαῦμα, wonder.</note> And if
                        the rainbow is a divinity, what will you do about the clouds? The rainbow

                        fabled to have given birth to the Centaurs. But if you enroll the clouds
                        among the gods, you will undoubtedly have to enroll the seasons, which have
                        been deified in the national ritual of Rome. If so, then rain and tempest,
                        storm and whirlwind must be deemed divine. At any rate </p>

                        itself is a goddess (and so she is believed to be, for she is the same as
                        the deity Tellus). But if the earth is divine, so also is the sea, which you
                        identified with Neptune<note type="footnote" n="b" place="opposite">b Cf.
                            ii. 66.</note>; and therefore the rivers and springs too. This is borne
                        out by the facts that Maso dedicated a Temple of Fons out of his Corsican
                        spoils, and that the Augurs' litany includes as we may see the names of
                        Tiberinus, Spino, Almo, Nodinus, and other rivers in the neighbourhood of
                        Rome. Either therefore this process will go on indefinitely, or we shall
                        admit none of these; and this unlimited claim of superstition will not be
                        accepted; therefore none of these is to be accepted. <note type="margin"

                        the Egyptians deem it sinful to pronounce his name. The fifth, worshipped by
                        the people of Pheneus, is said to have killed Argus and consequently to have
                        fled in exile to Egypt, where he gave the Egyptians their laws and letters.
                        His Egyptian name is Theuth, which is also the name in the Egyptian calendar
                        for the first month of the year. <note type="margin">57</note> Of the

                        first surgeon to employ splints. The second is the brother of the second
                        Mercury; he is said to have been struck by lightning and buried at Cynosura.
                        The third is the son of Arsippus and Arsinoë, and is said to have first
                        invented the use of purges and the extraction of teeth; his tomb and grove
                        are shown in Arcadia, not far from the river Lusius. <milestone

                        whom I stated just before to be the son of Vulcan and the guardian of
                        Athens. The second is the son of Corybas, and was born in Crete; tradition
                        says that he fought with Jupiter himself for the possession of that island.
                        The third is the son of the third Jupiter and of Latona, and is reputed to
                        have come to Delphi from the Hyperboreans. The fourth belongs to Arcadia,
                        and is called by the Arcadians Nomios, as being their traditional lawgiver.

                    <p> the winged Cupid. The second is more celebrated; tradition makes her the
                        daughter of the third Jupiter and of Latona. The father of the third is
                        recorded to have been Upis, and her mother Glauce; the Greeks often call her
                        by her father's name of Upis. We have a number of Dionysi. The first is the
                        son of Jupiter and Proserpine; the second. of Nile—he is the fabled slayer
                        of Nysa. The father of the third is Cabirus; it is stated that he was king
                        over Asia, and the Sabazia were instituted in his honour. The fourth, is the
                        son of Jupiter and Luna; the Orphic rites are believed to be celebrated in
                        his honour. The fifth is the son of Nisus and Thyone, and is believed to
                        have established the Trieterid festival. <note type="margin">59</note> The
                        first Venus is the daughter of the Sky and the Day; I have seen her temple
                        at Elis. The second was engendered from the sea-foam, and as we are told
                        became the mother by Mercury of the second Cupid. The third is the daughter
                        of Jupiter and Dione, who wedded Vulcan, but who is said to have been the
                        mother of Anteros by Mars. The fourth was conceived of Syria and

                        Minerva is the one whom we mentioned above as the mother of Apollo. The
                        second sprang from the Nile, and is worshipped by the Egyptians of Sais. The
                        third is she whom we mentioned above as begotten by Jupiter. The fourth is
                        the daughter of Jupiter and Coryphe the daughter of Oceanus, and is called
                        Koria by the Arcadians, who say that she was the inventor of the four-horsed
                        chariot. The fifth is Pallas, who is said to have slain her father when he
                        attempted to violate her maidenhood; she is represented with wings attached
                        to her ankles. <note type="margin">60</note> The first Cupid is said to be

                        and other similar fables have been culled from the ancient traditions of
                        Greece; you are aware that we ought to combat them, so that religion may not
                        be undermined. Your school however not merely do not refute them, but
                        actually confirm them by interpreting their respective meanings. But let us
                        now return to the point from which we digressed to this topic. <note

                        subtle argument is needed to refute these notions? Intelligence, faith,
                        hope, virtue, honour, victory, safety, concord and the other things of this
                        nature are obviously abstractions, not personal deities. For they are either
                        properties inherent in ourselves, for instance intelligence, hope, faith,
                        virtue, concord, or objects of our desire, for instance honour, safety,
                        victory. I see that they have value, and I am also aware that statues are
                        dedicated to them; but why they should be held to possess divinity is a
                        thing that I cannot understand without further enlightenment. Fortune has a
                        very strong claim to be counted in this list, and nobody will dissociate
                        fortune from inconstancy and haphazard action, which are certainly unworthy
                        of a deity. <note type="margin">62</note> "Again, why are you so fond of

                        What will you make of Vejovis, or Vulcan? though since you think the name
                        Neptune comes from nare ' to swim,' there will be no name of which you could
                        not make the derivation clear by altering one letter<note type="footnote"

                        the reasons for the names by which the various deities are called. But in so
                        doing you clearly admit that the facts are widely different from men's
                        belief, since the so-called gods are really properties of things, not divine
                        persons at all. <milestone unit="section" n="25"/> XXV. So far did this sort
                        of error go, that even harmful things were not only given the names of gods
                        but actually had forms of worship instituted in their honour: witness the
                        temple to Fever on the Palatine, that of Orbona the goddess of bereavement
                        close to the shrine of the Lares, and the altar consecrated to Misfortune on
                        the Esquiline. <note type="margin">64</note> Let us therefore banish from
                        philosophy entirely the error of making assertions in discussing the

                        in his own home, an old man and consul for the seventh time? why did that
                        monster of cruelty Cinna lord it for so long? You will say that he was
                        punished. <milestone unit="section" n="33"/> XXXIII. It would have been
                        better for him to be hindered and prevented from murdering so many eminent
                        men, than finally to be punished in his turn. That barbarous creature
                        Quintus Varius was executed with the most painful torture: if this was for
                        stabbing Drusus and poisoning Metellus, it would have been better for their
                        lives to be preserved than for Varius to be punished for his crime.
                        Dionysius was despot of a most wealthy and prosperous city for thirty-eight
                        years; <note type="margin">82</note> and before him, for how many years was
                        Pisistratus tyrant of Athens, the very flower of Greece! 4 Ah but Phalaris
                        (you say) met with punishment, and so did Apollodorus.' Yes, but not till

                        frequently punished, but still we cannot say that the captives cruelly
                        murdered do not outnumber </p>

                    <p> the brigands executed. It is related that Anaxarchus the disciple of
                        Democritus was cruelly butchered by the tyrant of Cyprus, and Zeno of Elea
                        tortured to death. Why need I mention Socrates, whose death when I read
                            Plato<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a se. the

                        verdict of the gods, if they do regard men's fortunes, has destroyed all
                        distinction between them? <note type="margin">83</note>
                        <milestone unit="section" n="34"/> XXXIV. Indeed Diogenes the Cynic used to
                        say that Harpalus, a brigand of the day who passed as fortunate, was a
                        standing witness against the gods, because he lived and prospered as he did
                        for so long. Dionysius, whom I mentioned before, having plundered the temple
                        of Proserpine at Locri, was sailing back to Syracuse, and as he ran before a
                        very favourable wind, remarked with a smile,' See you, my friends, what a
                        good crossing the immortal gods bestow on men guilty of sacrilege? ' He was
                        a clever fellow, and grasped the truth so well and clearly that he remained
                        in the same belief continuously; for touching with his fleet on the coast of
                        the Peloponnese and arriving at the temple of Olympian Zeus, he stripped him
                        of his gold mantle, an adornment consisting of a great weight of metal,
                        bestowed upon the god by the tyrant Gelo out of the spoils of the
                        Carthaginians, and actually made a jest about it, saying that a golden
                        mantle was oppressive in summer and cold in winter, and he threw on the god
                        a woollen cloak, saying it was for every season of the year. He also gave
                        orders for the removal of the golden beard of Aesculapius at Epidaurus,
                        saying it was not fitting for the son to wear a beard when his father<note

                        his temples beardless. <note type="margin">84</note> He even ordered the
                        silver tables to be carried off from all the shrines, saying that as they
                        bore the inscription ' the </p>

                    <pb n="371"/>

                            bordé.</note> Also he used to have no scruples in removing the little
                        gold images of Victory and the gold cups and crowns carried in the
                        outstretched hands of statues, and he used to say that he did not take them
                        but accepted them, for it was folly to pray to certain beings for benefits
                        and then when they proffered them as a gift to refuse to receive them. It is
                        also related that he produced in the market-place the spoils of the temples
                        which I have mentioned and sold them by auction, and after he had got the
                        money issued a proclamation that anybody who possessed any article taken
                        from a holy place must restore that article before a fixed date to the
                        shrine to which it belonged; thus to impiety towards the gods he added

                        harvests and fruits, and in short all the comfort and prosperity of their
                        lives, they think of as coming to them from the gods; but virtue no one ever
                        imputed to a god's bounty. <note type="margin">87</note> And doubtless with
                        good reason; for our virtue is a just ground for others' praise and a right
                        reason for our own pride, and this would not be so if the gift of virtue
                        came to us from a god and not from ourselves. On the other hand when we
                        achieve some honour or some accession to our estate, or obtain any other of
                        the goods or avoid any of the evils of fortune, it is then that we render
                        thanks to the gods, and do not think that our own credit has been enhanced.
                        Did anyone ever render thanks to the gods because he was a good man? No, but
                        because he was rich, honoured, secure. The reason why men give to Jupiter
                        the titles of Best and Greatest is not that they think that he makes us
                        just, temperate or wise, but safe, secure, wealthy and opulent. <note

                        blood. However, to return to my point, it is the considered belief of all
                        mankind that they must pray to god for fortune but obtain wisdom for
                        themselves. Let us dedicate temples as we will to Intellect, Virtue and

                        Samothrace, and a certain friend said to him, ' You who think that the gods
                        disregard men's affairs, do you not remark all the votive pictures that

                        to port, by dint of vows to the gods? ' ' That is so,' replied Diagoras; '
                        it is because there are nowhere any pictures of those who have been
                        shipwrecked and drowned at sea.' On another voyage he encountered a storm
                        which threw the crew of the vessel into a panic, and in their terror they
                        told him that they had brought it on themselves by having taken him on!

                        yourselves are fond of saying that there is nothing that a god cannot
                        accomplish, and that without any toil; as man's limbs are effortlessly moved
                        merely by his mind and will, so, as you say, the gods' power can mould and
                        move and alter all things. Nor do you say this as some superstitious fable
                        or old wives' tale, but you give a scientific and systematic account of it:
                        you allege that matter, which constitutes and contains all things, is in its
                        entirety flexible and subject to change, so that there is nothing that
                        cannot be moulded and transmuted out of it however suddenly, but the moulder
                        and manipulator of this universal substance is divine providence, and
                        therefore providence, whithersoever it moves, is able to perform whatever it
                        will. Accordingly either providence does not know its own powers, or it does
                        not regard human affairs, or it lacks power of judgement to discern what is
                        the best. <note type="margin">93</note> ' It does not care for individuals.'
                        This is no wonder; no more does it care for cities. Not for these? Not for

                        dreams is a tenet of your school. And do you also say that it is proper </p>

                    <pb n="381"/>
                    <p> for men to take vows upon themselves? Well, but vows are made by
                        individuals; therefore the divine mind gives a hearing even to the concerns
                        of individuals; do you see therefore that it is not so engrossed in business
                        as you thought? Grant that it is distracted between moving the heavens and
                        watching the earth and controlling the seas: why does it suffer so many gods
                        to be idle and keep holiday? why does it not appoint some of the leisured
                        gods whose countless numbers you expounded, Balbus, to superintend human
                        affairs? " This more or less is what I have to say about the nature of the
                        gods; it is not my design to disprove it, but to bring you to understand how
                        obscure it is and how difficult to explain." <note type="margin"

                        said: " You have indeed made a slashing attack upon the most reverently and
                        wisely constructed Stoic doctrine of the divine providence. But as evening
                        is now approaching, you will assign us a day on which to make our answer to
                        your views. For I have to fight against you on behalf of our altars and
                        hearths, of the temples and shrines of the gods, and of the city-walls,
                        which you as pontiffs declare to be sacred and are more careful to hedge the
                        city round with religious ceremonies than even with fortifications; and my
                        conscience forbids me to abandon their cause so long as I yet can breathe."
                            <note type="margin">95</note> " I on my side," replied Cotta, " only
                        desire to be refuted. My purpose was rather to discuss the doctrines I have
                        expounded than to pronounce judgement upon them, and I am confident that you
                        can easily defeat me." </p>

                    <p> " Oh, no doubt," interposed Velleius; " why, he thinks that even our dreams
                        are sent to us by Jupiter —though dreams themselves are not so unsubstantial
                        as a Stoic disquisition on the nature of the gods." Here the conversation
                        ended, and we parted, Velleius thinking Cotta's discourse to be the truer,
                        while I felt that that of Balbus approximated more nearly to a semblance of
                        the truth. </p>

                        false. For after saying a number of things tending to subvert religion, he
                        adds nevertheless that these matters ought not to be discussed in public,
                        lest such discussion destroy the established religion of the nation.

                        the nature of the gods says thus: First therefore it is not probable that
                        the material substance from which all things are derived was created by
                        divine providence, but that it has and has had a force and nature of its
                        own. As therefore the carpenter when about to build a house does not himself
                        make timber but employs that which has been prepared, and the same with the
                        modeller and his wax, so your divine providence ought to have been supplied
                        with matter not made by itself but given to it ready-made. But if matter was
                        not made by god, earth, water, air and fire also were not made by god.

                    <p> INTRODUCTION DATES OF COMPOSITION AND REVISION.—In Cicero's letters to Atticus
                        written during the summer of 45 B.C., when he was in retirement from public life
                        (see p. xi), there are many references to his work on this treatise. Writing
                        from Astura on May 13, and alluding to the death of his daughter, he says: ' Ego
                        hic duo magna συντάμγματα absolvi; nullo enim alio modo a miseria quasi aberrare
                        possum ' (Att. xii. 45. 1). On May 29, he writes from Tusculum (Att. xiii. 32.
                        3): 4 Torquatus Romaest; misi ut tibi daretur. Catulum et Lucullum ut opinor
                        antea; his libris nova prohoemia sunt addita quibus eorum uterque laudatur.'
                        Here 4 Torquatus ' means the first two books of De Finibus, and 4 Catulus ' the
                        first and 4 Lucullus ' the second book of Academica in its first shape; so it is
                        the latter treatise, and not De Finibus I. and II., that is probably referred to
                        by the modest expression in the preceding quotation 4 two big compilations.' We
                        infer that Academica in its first form was so far finished by the latter half of
                        May that a copy was sent to Atticus, new prefaces being added a little later.
                        Cicero refers to the treatise </p>
                    
                    <pb n="400"/>
                    <p> as ' Illam Ἀκαδημικὴν σύνταξιν' (Att. xiii. 6. 1), but the two volumes were
                        actually named Catulus and Lucullus, after the leading interlocutors in each.
                        Hortensius also figured in Catulus, and Cicero in both. But Cicero was not
                        satisfied with his work as it stood, and began at once to revise it, improving
                        the style and making the treatment more concise: he also divided the two volumes
                        into four. He writes of these alterations with great satisfaction (Att. xiii.
                        13. 1, June 26): ' ex duobus libris contuli in quattuor: grandiores sunt omnino
                        quam erant illi, sed tamen multa detracta.' Also (Att. xiii. 12. 3) Atticus
                        seems to have suggested that a literary compliment was due to Varro, who had
                        promised to dedicate an important work to Cicero (this was his De Lingua
                        Latina); and Cicero writes that although two years had passed without Varro's
                        having got on a yard with the work (' adsiduo cursu cubitum nullum
                        processerit'), he has decided to transfer to him the dedication of Academica,
                        and to postpone paying a compliment to Catulus, Lucullus and Hortensius, '
                        homines nobiles illi quidem sed nullo modo philologi ' (ibid.), in fact, well
                        known, not indeed for ἀπαιδευσία (want of education), but for ἀτριψία (lack of
                        special training) in these subjects (Att. xiii. 13. 1). Contents.—In Cicero's
                        encyclopaedia of philosophy Academica is the article on Epistemology, the theory
                        of knowledge. In his earlier draft of the work, in Book L, Catulus, the
                        scepticism of Carneades (Middle Academy) and his doctrine of ' probability '
                        were </p>
                    
                    <pb n="401"/>
                    <p> expounded by Catulus; Hortensius countered with the dogmatism of Antiochus (Old
                        Academy), and Cicero put the case of Philo (Middle Academy), that ' probability
                        ' is consistent with Platonism. In Book II., Lucullus, Lucullus defended the
                        cause of Antiochus by attacking Scepticism, and then Scepticism was defended by
                        Cicero. In the second edition Cicero and Varro were the sole interlocutors;
                        Cicero championed the Middle Academy as well as the New, and the Old Academy was
                        assigned to Varro. It is to this second edition that Cicero refers in his
                        letters in all allusions to the work after the alteration was made; its title
                        was now Academica, though he also describes it as ' Academici libri.' But he
                        seems not to have succeeded in entirely suppressing the first edition; and by a
                        curious accident the second half of the first edition has come down to us, while
                        of the second edition only the first quarter and a few fragments of the
                        remainder have survived. We therefore have only three quarters of the whole
                        work, and only one quarter of it in the form finally authorized by the writer.
                        Some modern editors have designated the extant part of Edition I. ' Academica
                        Priora' and that of Edition II. ' Academica Posteriora,' but so far as I know
                        the significance intended to be conveyed by the adjectives in those titles has
                        no classical authority. The position can be most clearly exhibited in tabular
                        form; the parts of the editions that are not now extant and the names of the
                        speakers in those parts are printed in italics: </p>

                        DRAMATIS PERSONAE.—Q. Lutatius Catulus, a distinguished leader of the aristocracy, was consul with Lepidus in 78 B.C., when he resisted his colleague's efforts to abrogate the acts of Sulla, and next year defeated him in the battle of the Milvian Bridge. He opposed the conferment of extraordinary powers on Pompey in 67 and 66, and was censor with Crassus in 65. He died in 60. There is no evidence that he was interested in philosophy. In the dialogue he professes merely to put forward the views of his father, the famous colleague of Marius. The elder Catulus was a man of great culture and learning, but Cicero could not introduce him into the dialogue for reasons of chronology: he died in 87, committing suicide to escape the proscription of Marius.
                        L. Licinius Lucullus (c. 110-57 B.C.) was also a

                    <p> supporter of Sulla, and was famous as the conqueror of Mithridates. He was
                        superseded in his command by Pompey in 66, and gradually withdrew from public
                        life. He had amassed great wealth on his Asiatic campaigns, and was famous for
                        the splendour of his establishments. He had literary tastes and was a generous
                        patron of letters. Q. Hortensius (114-50 B.C) made a career and a fortune by his
                        oratorical ability. An adherent of Sulla and the aristocratic party, he was
                        consul in 69; but in the previous year the trial of Verres for peculation in
                        Sicily had transferred the primacy in oratory from Verres' defender, Hortensius,
                        to his prosecutor, Cicero. Hortensius was an opponent of Pompey, and on Pompey's
                        coalition with Crassus and Caesar in 60 he retired from politics. M. Terentius
                        Varro (116-28 B.C) was the most learned of scholars and the most encyclopaedic
                        of writers. His works included agriculture, grammar, religious and political
                        antiquities, biography, philosophy, geography and law; some parts of his books
                        on the first two subjects alone survive. He also had a public career; he held
                        naval command against the pirates and against Mithridates, and he supported
                        Pompey in the civil war, but after Pharsalia Caesar forgave him, and employed
                        his talents in collecting books for a great public library. The Imaginary Date
                        of the dialogues in the first edition falls between 63 B.C, the year of Cicero's
                        consulship (alluded to Ac. ii. 62), and 60, when Catulus died. The scene of the
                        first conversation (now lost) was the sea-side villa of Catulus at Cumae, west
                        of Naples; that of the second (our Academica II.), a day later, is Hortensius's
                        villa at Bauli, a little </p>
                    
                    <pb n="404"/>
                    <p> place on the Gulf of Puteoli (Pozzuoli), just east of Cumae. In the second
                        edition the scene is laid at Varro's villa near the Lucrine Lake, the enclosed
                        recess of the Gulf of Puteoli. The imaginary date is near the actual time of
                        composition in 45 B.C. ('nuper,' Ac. i. 1). SOURCES OF ACADEMICA.—Cicero
                        frequently states that his arguments for dogmatism are those of his old teacher,
                        Antiochus of Ascalon; and it is pretty clear that he merely transcribed them
                        from some book or books of this authority. For dramatic effect, at Ac. ii. 11 f.
                        he makes Lucullus profess to be producing arguments from his recollection of
                        discussions in which Antiochus had taken part; but there is no doubt that
                        actually he is writing with a book of Antiochus in front of him, probably Sosus
                        (see Ac. ii. 12 note), a dialogue in which Antiochus combated his old teacher
                        Philo. The arguments in defence of scepticism come partly from a work of Philo
                        twice referred to, though not by its name (Ac. i. 13, ii. 11): this doubtless
                        supplied Cicero with the historical justification of the New Academy which
                        concludes Book L, and probably also with the historical references with which he
                        begins his speech that ends the work (Ac. ii. 66-78). The destructive arguments
                        that these follow are very likely taken from Clitomachus, who succeeded
                        Carneades as head of the New Academy in 129 B.C The constructive doctrines of
                        Carneades that come next are drawn from two works of Clitomachus mentioned by
                        their names (ii. 98» 103); and the historical passage that concludes is
                        doubtless also from Clitomachus, who wrote a book Περὶ Αἱρέσεων (Diogenes
                        Lacrtius ii. 92). </p>

                    <p>MANUSCRIPTS.—Scholars range the MSS. of Academica I. in two families, derived
                        from two archetypes of the twelfth century or older. Of the former family, one
                        ms., 'codex Puteanus,'Parisinus 6331 (which contains De Finibus also), is placed
                        by recent critics in the twelfth century, and several MSS. related to it belong
                        to the fourteenth or fifteenth century. Of the latter family, all are fourteenth
                        or fifteenth century. In the present edition only a few specially interesting
                        variants are given, the readings of Puteanus being quoted as P, but the other
                        MSS. not being distinguished. Academica II. is contained in the same MSS. as De
                        Natura Deorum, for which see p. x viii. Editions.—J. S. Reid's edition of 188-1
                        (London) is a most valuable resource; it contains an exhaustive introduction and
                        commentary. The newest text is that of Plasberg (Teubner, Leipzig, 1922). In
                        this the evidence for the text is fully set out; also the preface gives in full
                        all the passages in Cicero's Letters that refer to Academica, and a valuable
                        study of the relation between Cicero's two editions. Literary students will also
                        be grateful to Mr. Plasberg for two quotations that grace the back of his
                        title-page— one from Pliny (Nat. Hist. xxxi. 6) which shows that Cicero actually
                        named his villa at Puteoli (Pozzuoli) 1 Academia,' and the other from
                        Copernicus, writing to Pope Paul III. in 1543 and saying that the earliest
                        suggestion which he had seen that the earth is in motion was a statement that he
                        quotes from Cicero (viz. Ac. ii. 123). H. R. 1932.</p>

                    indocilem usus disciplinam. Itaque cum totum iter et navigationem consumpsisset
                    partim in percontando a peritis, partim in rebus gestis legendis, in Asiam
                    factus imperator venit, cum esset Roma profectus rei militaris rudis. Habuit
                    enim divinam quandam memoriam rerum, verborum maiorem Hortensius, sed quo plus
                    in negotiis gerendis res quam verba prosunt, hoc erat memoria illa praestantior;
                    quam fuisse in Themistocle, quem facile Graeciae principem ponimus, singularem

                    extraxisset, tamen (ut ea pars defensionis relinquatur) quid impediet actionem

                    'Hoc,' inquit,' ipsum impediet, quod statuet ne id quidem quod probet posse

                    consentaneum esse ei qui adfirmaret nihil posse comprehendi id ipsum saltem
                    dicere posse comprendi. Quod ipsi Antiocho pingue videbatur et sibi ipsum

                    comprendi posse dicatur. Illo modo potius putat urguendum fuisse Carneadem: cum

                    lately at my country-place at Cumae, when a message came to us from Marcus
                    Varro's house that he had arrived from Rome on the evening of the day before,
                    and if not fatigued from the journey intended to come straight on to us. On
                    hearing this, we thought that no obstacle must intervene to delay our seeing a
                    person united to us by identity of studies as well as by old friendship; so we
                    hastily set out to go to him, and where only a short distance from his
                    country-house when we saw him coming towards us in person. We gave our Varro a
                    friend's embrace, and after a fairly long interval we escorted him back to his
                    own house. <note type="margin">2</note> Here there was first a little
                    conversation, and that arising out of my asking whether Rome happened to have
                    been doing anything new 7; and then Atticus said, " Do pray drop those subjects,
                    about which we can neither ask questions nor hear the answers without distress;
                    inquire of him instead whether he himself has done anything new. For Varro's
                    Muses have kept silent for a longer time than they used, but all the same my
                    belief is that your </p>

                <pb n="413"/>
                <p> friend is not taking a holiday but is hiding what he writes." " Oh no, certainly
                    not," said Varro, " for I think that to put in writing what one wants to be kept
                    hidden is sheer recklessness; but I have got a big task in hand, and have had
                    for a long time: I have begun on a work<note type="footnote" n="a"
                        place="opposite">a Varro's De Lingua Latina, see Introduction p. 400.</note>
                    dedicated to our friend here himself"—meaning me—" which is a big thing I can
                    assure you, and which is getting a good deal of touching up and polishing at my
                    hands." <note type="margin">3</note> At this I said, " As to that work of yours,
                    Varro, I have been waiting for it a long time now, but all the same I don't
                    venture to demand it; for I have heard (since we cannot hide anything of that
                    kind) from our friend Libo, an enthusiastic student as you know, that you are
                    not leaving it off, but are giving it increased attention, and never lay it out
                    of your hands. However, there is a question that it has never occurred to me to
                    put to you before the present moment, but now, after I have embarked on the task
                    of placing upon record the doctrines that I have learnt in common with you, and
                    of expounding in Latin literary form the famous old system of philosophy that
                    took its rise from Socrates, I do put the question why, though you write a great
                    deal, you pass over this class of subject, especially when you yourself are
                    distinguished in it, and also when this interest and this whole subject far
                    outstrip all other interests and other sciences? " <note type="margin">Varro

                    without Greek learning: and therefore I was unwilling to write what the

                    the Greek books will read these and those who can read the Greek will not
                    overlook the works of their own nation. For what reason is there why
                    accomplished Grecians should read Latin poets and not read Latin philosophers?
                    Is it because they get pleasure from Ennius, Pacuvius, Accius and many others,
                    who have reproduced not the words but the meaning of the Greek poets? How much
                    more pleasure will they get from philosophers, if these imitate Plato, Aristotle
                    and Theophrastus in the same way as those poets imitated Aeschylus, Sophocles
                    and Euripides? At all events I see that any of our orators that have imitated

                    which all philosophers before him had been engaged, and led it to the subject of
                    ordinary life, in order to investigate the virtues and vices, and good and evil
                    generally, and to realize that heavenly matters are either remote from our

                    to affirm nothing himself but to refute others, to assert that he knows nothing
                    except the fact of his own ignorance, and that he surpassed all other people in
                    that they think they know things that they do not know but he himself thinks he

                    this opinion, yet nevertheless the whole of his discourses were spent in
                    praising virtue and in exhorting mankind to the zealous pursuit of virtue, as
                    can be gathered from the books of members of the Socratic school, and

                    the associates of Aristotle were called the Peripatetics, because they used to

                    their appellation from the name of the place. But both schools drew plentiful
                    supplies from Plato's abundance, and both framed a definitely formulated rule of
                    doctrine, and this fully and copiously set forth, whereas they abandoned the
                    famous Socratic custom of discussing everything in a doubting manner and without
                    the admission of any positive statement. Thus was produced something that

                    and others in the parts: health, strength and beauty were goods of the whole,
                    goods of the parts were sound senses and the particular excellences of the parts
                    severally, for instance speed in the feet, power in the hands, clearness in the

                    the most supremely excellent of all the faculties of the mind as they define

                    estate '—that was the third division—they said belonged certain properties that
                    influenced the exercise of virtue. For virtue is displayed in connexion with the
                    goods of the mind and those of the body, and with some that are the attributes
                    not so much of nature as of happiness. Man they deemed to be, so to say, a '

                    increase or to its protection, for instance wealth, resources, fame, influence.
                    Thus they introduced a triple classification of goods. <note type="margin"

                    classes of goods which most people think to be intended by the Peripatetics.
                    This is indeed correct, for this classification is theirs, but it is a mistake
                    if people suppose that the Academics quoted above and the Peripatetics were
                    different schools. This theory was common to both, and both held that the end of
                    goods was to acquire either all or the greatest of the things that are by nature
                    primary, and are intrinsically worthy of desire; and the greatest of these are
                    the ones which have their being in the mind itself and in virtue itself.
                    Accordingly the whole of the great philosophy of antiquity held that happiness
                    lies in virtue alone, yet that happiness is not supreme without the addition of
                    the goods of the body and all the other goods suitable for the employment of
                    virtue that were specified above. <note type="margin">23</note> From this scheme
                    they used also to arrive at a first principle of conduct in life and of duty
                    itself, which principle lay in safeguarding the things that nature prescribed.
                    Hence sprang the duty of avoiding idleness and of disregarding pleasures,
                    leading on to the undergoing of many great toils and pains for the sake of the

                    these they rated higher than pleasures and an abundance of the good things of
                    life. This then was their system of ethics, the plan and outline of the

                    arose indeed from the senses, yet was not in the senses: the judge of things
                    was, they held, the mind—they thought that it alone deserves credence, because
                    it alone perceives that which is eternally simple and uniform and true to its
                    own quality. This thing they call the Idea, a name already given it by Plato; we
                    can correctly term it form. <note type="margin">31</note> All the senses on the
                    other hand they deemed to be dull and sluggish, and entirely unperceptive of all
                    the things supposed to fall within the province of the senses, which were either
                    so small as to be imperceptible by sense, or in such a violent state of motion
                    that no single thing was ever stationary, nor even remained the same thing,
                    because all things were in continual ebb and flow; accordingly all this portion
                    of things they called the object of opinion. <note type="margin">32</note>
                    Knowledge on the other hand they deemed to exist nowhere except in the notions
                    and reasonings of the mind; and consequently they approved the method of
                    defining things, and applied this ' real definition '<note type="footnote" n="c"

                    impossible, and that not merely the exercise of virtue, as his predecessors

                    with these doctrines either, for he thought that even the emotions were
                    voluntary and were experienced owing to a judgement of opinion, and he held that
                    the mother of all the emotions was a sort of intemperance and lack of

                    substance, such as Xenocrates and the older thinkers also had pronounced the
                    mind to be, was incapable of any activity, whereas anything capable of acting,

                    ' credible.' On the strength of this he deemed the senses also trustworthy,

                    of ' to disagree,' ' dissent ': it is derived from ' swords.' Cicero, Academica,

                    Carneades in so many volumes? ' 2. (Under concinnare.) The same author in
                    Academica Bk. I.: ' With whom by reason of the similarity of the word he seemed
                    to himself to be completely in harmony . . From Book II 3. The view that aequor
                    is derived from aequum, 1 level,' is supported by Cicero, Academica, Book II.: 1
                    What seems so level as the sea? This is actually the reason why the word for it
                    in poetry is aequor.' 4. Adamare. ' For those who have fallen in love with
                    office too late gain admission to it with difficulty, and cannot be enough in
                    favour with the multitude.' 5. Exponere meaning ' to show examples of good ': 1
                    To crush avarice, to put away crime, to exhibit one's own life for the young to
                    imitate.' 6. Hebes, ' dull,' used in the sense of ' dark,' or </p>

                    not require plumblines or rods or rulers.' 9. Siccum means 'dried up' devoid of
                    moisture. . . . Siccum also means ' sober,' not a soaker. ' We notice a

                    desperadoes—who would not call this a most pitiable and also a most foolish
                    occupation? ' 13. Exultare means ' to jump out.' ' And just as we are now
                    sitting by the Lucrine Lake and see the little fishes jumping out of the water
                    14. Ingeneraretur in the sense of ' might be born in.' ' That in man alone among

                    Vindicare 'to draw,' 'to set free.' 'Let him show some capacity, let him
                    champion himself into freedom.' 16. Cicero . . . who in his third Academic
                    volume has these words: ' Whereas if those who have pursued a devious path in
                    life were allowed, like travellers who had wandered from the road, to remedy
                    their mistake by repenting, the correction of recklessness would be easier.' 17.
                    Varro in his third book dedicated to Cicero uses fixum, and Cicero in Academica,

                    (Cicero): ' To me however we seem not only blind to wisdom but dull and blunted
                    even towards things that are in some measure visible.' 19. ' Such,' says the
                    Academic speaker, ' seem to me to be all the things that I have thought fit to
                    entitle " probable " or possessed of verisimilitude; if you want to call them by
                    another name I make no objection, for it satisfies me that you have already well
                    grasped my meaning, that is, the things to which I assign these names: since it
                    becomes the wise man to be not a manufacturer of words but a researcher into
                    things.' 20. The books of Cicero that he wrote to champion this cause contain a
                    certain passage that seems to me to have a remarkably witty flavour, while some
                    people </p>

                <pb n="463"/>
                <p> think it actually a powerful and strong piece of writing. Indeed it is hard to
                    see how anybody could fail to be impressed by what is said there, that ' the
                    Wise Man of the Academy is given the second role by all the adherents of the
                    other schools that seem wise in their own eyes, though of course they each claim
                    the first part for themselves; and that from this the probable inference may be
                    drawn that, since he is second by everybody else's verdict, his own verdict is
                    right in placing him first.' [There follows a page of imaginary dialogue between
                    Zeno, Epicurus and an Academic, which some editors print as a verbatim quotation
                    from Cicero; but the style makes this unlikely, and it is not introduced as a
                    quotation, as is the passage above.] 21. For he (Cicero) says that they ' had a
                    habit of concealing their opinion, and did not usually disclose it to anybody
                    except those that had lived with them right up to old age.' 22. Finally Tully
                    himself also bears such witness to this man (Marcus Varro) as to say in
                    Academica that the discussion there set out took place between himself and
                    Marcus Varro, ' a person who was easily the most penetrating of all men, and
                    without any doubt extremely learned.' </p>

                    from public life at Rome in the period when he might have won the greatest

                    his journey by land and sea partly in cross-questioning those who were experts
                    and partly in reading military history, he arrived in Asia a made general,
                    although he had started from Rome a tiro in military matters. For he had a
                    memory for facts that was positively inspired, although Hortensius had a better
                    memory for words, but Lucullus's memory was the more valuable, inasmuch as in
                    the conduct of business facts are of more assistance than words; and this form
                    of memory is recorded as having been present in a remarkable degree in
                    Themistocles, whom we rank as easily the greatest man of Greece, and of whom the
                    story is told that when somebody<note type="footnote" n="c" place="opposite">c
                        The lyric poet Simonides of Ceos (556-467 B.C.), the inventor of the

                    first coming into vogue, he replied that he would sooner learn to forget—no
                    doubt this was because whatever he heard or saw remained fixed in his memory.
                    Gifted with such natural endowments, Lucullus had also added the training which
                    Themistocles had despised, and thus he kept facts engraved on his mind just as
                    we enshrine in writing things that we desire to record. <note type="margin"

                <pb n="469"/>
                <p> of those that he had read of. He also possessed so much wisdom and justice in
                    the work of establishing and reforming governments that Asia to-day continues to
                    observe the institutions and follow in the footsteps of Lucullus. But although
                    greatly to the advantage of the state, nevertheless those vast powers of
                    character and of intellect were absent abroad, out of the sight of both the
                    law-courts and the senate, for a longer time than I could have wished. Moreover
                    when he returned<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a At the end of 67
                        B.C.</note> victorious from the Mithridatic War, the chicanery of his
                    enemies postponed his triumph three years later than it ought to have taken
                    place; for it was I as consul who virtually led into the city the chariot of
                    this glorious hero, of the value to me of whose advice and influence at that
                    period in the most important affairs<note type="footnote" n="b" place="opposite"

                    involve speaking about myself, which at this time is not necessary; and so I
                    will rob him of the tribute due to him rather than combine it with my own
                    praise. <note type="margin">4</note>
                    <milestone unit="section" n="2"/> II. However, the things in Lucullus's career
                    that deserved the honour of a national celebration have fairly well won their
                    tribute of fame in both Greek and Latin records. But my knowledge of these facts
                    about his public life I share with many persons; the following more private
                    details I have often learnt from himself in company with few others—for Lucullus
                    was more ardently devoted both to letters of all sorts and to philosophy than
                    persons who did not know him supposed, and indeed not only at an early age but
                    also for some years during his proquaestorship, and even on active service, when
                    military duties are usually so engrossing as to leave a commander not much
                    leisure when actually under canvas. But as Philo's pupil Antiochus was deemed </p>

                <pb n="471"/>
                <p> the chief among philosophers for intellect and learning, he kept him in his
                    company both when quaestor and when a few years later he became general, and
                    having the powerful memory that I have spoken of already he easily learnt from
                    frequent repetition doctrines that he would have been quite capable of learning
                    from a single hearing. Moreover, he took a marvellous delight in reading the
                    books about which Antiochus used to discourse to him. <note type="margin"
                        >5</note> And I am sometimes afraid lest in regard to men of this character
                    my desire to magnify their fame may actually diminish it. For there are many
                    people who have no love for Greek literature at all, and more who have none for
                    philosophy; while the residue even if they do not disapprove of these studies
                    nevertheless think that the discussion of such topics is not specially becoming
                    for great statesmen. But for my own part, as I have been told that Marcus Cato
                    learnt Greek literature in his old age, while history-states that Publius
                    Africanus, on the famous embassy<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a

                    censorship, had Panaetius as absolutely the sole member of his staff, I need not
                    look any further for someone to support the claims either of Greek literature or
                    of philosophy. <note type="margin">Combination of study and affairs in the best

                    meetings in silence, or else engage in frivolous conversation or discussion on
                    lighter topics! In fact, if there is truth in the praise of philosophy that
                    occupies a certain volume<note type="footnote" n="b" place="opposite">b Cicero's
                        Hortensius.</note> of mine, it is obvious that its pursuit is supremely
                    worthy of all persons of the highest character and eminence, and the only
                    precaution that </p>

                    But if at the time when we had official duties to perform we not only never
                    removed our interest from the national assembly but never even put pen to paper
                    save on matters of public business, who will criticize our leisure, if therein
                    we not only are reluctant to allow ourselves to grow dull and slack but also
                    strive to be of service to the greatest number of men? At the same time in our
                    judgement we are not merely not diminishing but actually increasing the fame of

                    jealous of the dead as well as of the living. <note type="margin">The Academic

                    us more if anybody approved any set of doctrines except the one of which he
                    himself was a follower. But for our part, since it is our habit to put forward
                    our views in conflict with all schools, we cannot refuse to allow others to
                    differ from us; although we at all events have an easy brief to argue, who

                    hold many doctrines as probable, which we can easily act upon but can scarcely

                    power of judgement uncurtailed, and are bound by no compulsion to support all
                    the dogmas laid down for us almost as edicts by certain masters. For all other
                    people in the first place are held in close bondage placed upon them before they
                    were able to judge what doctrine was the best, and secondly they form judgements
                    about matters as to which they know nothing at the most incompetent period of
                    life, either under the guidance of some friend or under the influence of a

                    inquiry of yesterday was almost fully cleared up, so that nearly the whole of
                    the subject now appears to have been handled; but nevertheless I am waiting with
                    interest for you, Lucullus, to fulfil your promise of telling us the doctrines
                    that you heard from Antiochus." " For my part," said Hortensius, " I could wish
                    that I had not gone so far, for the whole subject ought to have been reserved in
                    its entirety for Lucullus. And yet perhaps it has been reserved, for it was the
                    more obvious points that were expounded by me, whereas I look to Lucullus to
                    give us the more abstruse doctrines." " Your expectancy, Hortensius," rejoined
                    Lucullus, " does not, it is true, upset me, although there is nothing that so

                    not mind how far I am successful in gaining assent for the views that I expound;
                    for the doctrines that I am going to state are not my own, nor are they ones
                    about which, if they are unsound, I should not wish rather to be refuted than to
                    carry the day. But I protest that even though my case was shaken by yesterday's
                    discussion, it nevertheless appears to me to be profoundly true—at least as it
                    stands at present. I will therefore adopt what used to be the procedure of
                    Antiochus (for I am familiar with the subject, since I used to hear him with
                    undistracted attention and with great interest, even more than once on the same
                    topic), so as to cause even more to be expected of me than Hortensius did just
                    now." <note type="margin">11</note> On his beginning in this strain we aroused
                    our attention to listen to him; whereupon he proceeded: " When I was

                    Tyrian Heraclitus, was at Alexandria already; he had been for many years a pupil
                    of both Clitomachus and Philo, and was undoubtedly a person of standing and
                    distinction in the school of philosophy in question, which after having been

                    had then for the first time come into Antiochus's hands; whereupon though by
                    nature one of the gentlest of people (in fact nothing could have been kinder
                    than he was) he nevertheless began to lose his temper. This surprised me, as I

                    him whether he really thought that those doctrines were Philo's, or whether he
                    had ever heard them either from Philo or from any member of the Academy.<note

                    when consuls carried popular legislation about processes of appeal; then they
                    come to the better known cases of Gaius Flaminius, <note type="margin">232

                    have a way of including even Publius Africanus in the same list. But they say
                    that the two very wise and distinguished brothers Publius Crassus and Publius
                    Scaevola were supporters of the laws of Tiberius Gracchus, the former (as we

                    more covertly. They also add Gaius Marius, and about him at all events they say
                    nothing that is untrue. After parading all this list of names of men of such
                    distinction they declare that they themselves are following the principle set up

                    that, just as in the noblest of states Tiberius Gracchus arose to disturb the
                    atmosphere of peace, so when the most authoritative schools of philosophy had
                    now come to a standstill, then there arose Arcesilas to overthrow the
                    established philosophy, and to lurk behind the authority of those whom he
                    asserted to have denied the possibility of all knowledge and perception? From
                    the list of these we must remove both Plato and Socrates—the former because he
                    left behind him a most consummate system of thought, the Peripatetic School and
                    the Academy, which have different names but agree in substance, and from which

                    Zeno's definitions attempted to cover with darkness matters that were
                    exceedingly clear? His system was at first not very much accepted, although he
                    was distinguished both by acuteness of intellect and by a certain admirable
                    charm of style, and at the first stage it was preserved by Lacydes only, but
                    afterwards it was completed by Carneades, who is the fourth in line from
                    Arcesilas, having attended the courses of Hegesinus<note type="footnote" n="a"

                    been his pupils were of considerable eminence, Clitomachus being the one among
                    them most distinguished for industry (as is proved by the large number of his
                    books), though there was an equal amount of talent in Hagnon, of eloquence in

                    the Academics, was entirely ruled out by some of the philosophers, and those
                    indeed men of no inconsiderable standing, and they held that there was really no

                    criticized the Stoic Antipater for spending much time in this; and they also
                    asserted that there was no need to define the essential nature of knowledge or
                    perception or (if we wish to give a literal translation) ' mental grasp,' the

                    at me —" think that he has a monopoly of this licence): well, they thought that
                    no argument could be discovered that was clearer than evidentness itself, and
                    they deemed that truths so manifest did not need defining. But others said that
                    they would not have opened proceedings with any speech in defence of this
                    evidentness, but held that the proper course was for argument to be directed to
                    answering the case for the prosecution, so that they might not be somehow taken

                    that human beings deserve to have their views discussed. But Philo, in raising
                    certain revolutionary doctrines because he was scarcely able to withstand the
                    usual arguments against the obstinacy of the Academics, manifestly propounds
                    what is not true, as he was blamed for doing by the elder Catulus, and also, as
                    Antiochus proved, himself slipped into the very position that he was afraid of.
                    For when he thus maintained that there was nothing that could be grasped (that
                    is the expression that we choose in rendering acatalēpton<note type="footnote"

                        catalēpton.</note>), if that ' presentation ' of winch he spoke (for we have
                    by this time sufficiently habituated ourselves by our yesterday's conversation
                    to this rendering of pkantasia) was, as Zeno defined it, a presentation
                    impressed and moulded from the object from which it came in a form such as it
                    could not have if it came from an object that was not the one that it actually
                    did come from (we declare that this definition of Zeno's is absolutely correct,
                    for how can anything be grasped in such a way as to make you absolutely
                    confident that it has been perceived and known, if it has a form that could
                    belong to it even if it were false?)—when Philo weakens and abolishes this, he
                    abolishes the criterion between the unknowable and the knowable; which leads to
                    the inference that nothing can be grasped—so incautiously does he come round to
                    the position that he most wants to avoid. Therefore the whole defence of the
                    case against the Academy is undertaken by us on the line of preserving the

                    I cannot see what more it could ask for. Nor indeed is it necessary to delay at

                    that every object seen is really such as it appears to be. Let Epicurus see to
                    that, and a number of other matters; but in my judgement the senses contain the
                    highest truth, given that they are sound and healthy and also that all obstacles
                    and hindrances are removed. That is why we often desire a change of the light
                    and of the position of the objects that we are observing, and diminish or
                    enlarge their distances from us, and take various measures, until mere looking
                    makes us trust the judgement that it forms. The same is done in the case of
                    sounds and smell and taste, so that among us there is nobody who desiderates
                    keener powers of judgement in the senses, each in its class. <note type="margin"

                    sensitive to painting and our ears to music, who is there who can fail to remark
                    the power that the senses possess? How many things painters see in shadows and
                    in the foreground which we do not see! how many things in music that escape us
                    are caught by the hearing of persons trained in that department of art, who when

                    suspicion of it! It is unnecessary to talk at all about the faculties of taste
                    and smell, which possess a certain discernment, although it is of a defective
                    sort. Why speak of touch, and indeed of the internal tactual sense, as the
                    philosophers call it, perceptive of either pain or pleasure, the sole basis, as
                    the Cyrenaics think, of our judgement of truth, caused by the mere process of
                    sensation? Is it therefore possible for anybody to say that there is no
                    difference between a person experiencing pain and a person experiencing
                    pleasure, or would not the holder of this opinion be a manifest lunatic? <note

                    which we say are perceived by the senses must belong to that following set of
                    objects which are said to be perceived not by actual sensation but by a sort of
                    sensation, as for example: ' Yonder thing is white, this thing is sweet, that
                    one is melodious, this fragrant, this rough.' This class of percepts consists of
                    comprehensions grasped by our mind, not by our senses. Then ' Yonder object is a
                    horse, yonder a dog.' Next follows the rest of the series linking on a chain of
                    larger percepts, for instance the following, which embrace as it were a fully
                    completed grasp of the objects: ' If it is a human being, it is a rational
                    mortal animal.' From this class of percept are imprinted upon us our notions of
                    things, without which all understanding and all investigation and discussion are

                    memory, the one principal foundation not only of philosophy but of all the
                    conduct of life and all the sciences. For how can there possibly be a memory of
                    what is false? or what can anyone remember that he does not grasp and hold in

                    certainty of any fact that furnished a reason why it was his duty to do so? It
                    is therefore absolutely impossible that anybody should set so high a value upon
                    equity and good faith as to refuse no torture for the sake of preserving it,

                <p> way out? And what will happen to Wisdom? it is her duty not to doubt herself or
                    her ' decisions,' which philosophers term dogmata, any of which it will be a
                    crime to abandon; for the surrender of such a ' decision' is the betrayal of the
                    moral law. and that sin is the common source of betrayals of friends and
                    country. Therefore it cannot be doubted that no ' decision ' of a wise man can
                    be false, and that it is not sufficient for them not to be false but they must
                    also be firmly settled and ratified, immovable by any argument<note

                    belong to them on the theory of those who maintain that the sense-presentations

                        type="margin">28</note> From this sprang the demand put forward by
                    Hortensius, that your school should say that the wise man has perceived at least
                    the mere fact that nothing can be perceived. But when Antipater used to make the
                    same demand, and to say that one who asserted that nothing could be perceived
                    might yet consistently say that this single fact could be perceived, namely that
                    nothing else could, Carneades with greater acumen used to oppose him; he used to
                    declare that this was so far from being consistent that it was actually grossly
                    inconsistent: for the man who said there was nothing that was perceived made no
                    exception, and so not even the impossibility of perception could itself be
                    grasped and perceived in any way, because it had not been excepted. <note

                    could be perceived, they were bound not to </p>

                <p> waver in their own ' decision' as they did in everything else, particularly when
                    it was the keystone of their system, for this was the measuring-rod that applied
                    to the whole of philosophy, the test of truth and falsehood, of knowledge and
                    ignorance; and that since they adopted this method, and desired to teach what
                    sense-presentations ought to be accepted and what rejected, they unquestionably
                    ought to have perceived this decision itself, the basis of every criterion of
                    truth and falsehood; for (he said) the two greatest things in philosophy were
                    the criterion of truth and the end of goods, and no man could be a sage who was
                    ignorant of the existence of either a beginning of the process of knowledge or
                    an end of appetition, and who consequently did not know from what he was
                    starting or at what he ought to arrive; but to be in doubt as to these matters
                    and not to feel immovably sure of them was to be very widely remote from wisdom.
                    On these lines therefore they ought to have been required rather to say that
                    this one thing at least was perceived—the impossibility of perceiving anything.
                    But about the inconsistency of the whole of their theory, if anybody holding no
                    positive view at all can be said to have any theory, enough, as I think, may
                    have been said. <note type="margin">(3) The argument from psychology: knowledge,

                    then we direct the senses to perceive the objects. For the mind itself, which is
                    the source of the sensations and even is itself sensation, has a natural force
                    which it directs to the things by which it is moved. Accordingly some

                    it were stores away, these being the source of memory, while all the rest it
                    unites into systems by their mutual resemblances, and from these are formed the
                    concepts of objects which the Greeks term sometimes ennoiai and sometimes

                    things, and also this same reason having been by these stages made complete

                    wide topic, but the foundations have been laid a little time back. For while we

                    power residing in the senses, it was at the same time disclosed that many things
                    are grasped and perceived by the senses, which cannot happen without the act of
                    assent. Again, as the greatest difference between an inanimate and an animate
                    object is that an animate object performs some action (for an entirely inactive
                    animal is an utterly inconceivable thing), either it must be denied the
                    possession of sensation or it must be assigned a faculty of assenting as a

                    refuse to exercise either sensation or assent are in a manner robbed of the mind
                    itself; for as the scale of a balance must necessarily sink when weights are put

                    that is presented to its view as suited to its nature (the Greeks term it
                    oikeion), so the mind cannot refrain from giving approval to a clear object when

                    all talk whatever about assent is beside the mark; for he who perceives anything
                    assents immediately. But there also follow<note type="footnote" n="a"
                        place="opposite">a See § 30 n.</note> the points that without assent memory,
                    and mental concepts of objects, and sciences, are impossible; and most important
                    of all, granting that some freedom of the will exists, none will exist in one
                    who assents to nothing; where then is virtue, if nothing rests with ourselves?
                        <note type="margin">39</note> And what is most absurd is that men's vices
                    should be in their own power and that nobody should sin except with assent, but
                    that the same should not be true in the case of virtue, whose sole consistency
                    and strength is constituted by the things to which it has given its assent and

                    usually advanced by this school on the other side. But before that, this is an
                    opportunity for you to learn the 'foundations '<note type="footnote" n="c"

                    classes, and in particular the nature of that which can be perceived and
                        grasped,<note type="footnote" n="d" place="opposite">d Id . . . possit = τὸ
                        καταληπτόν.</note> at as great a length as do the Stoics. Then they set out
                    the two propositions </p>

                <pb n="519"/>
                <p> that ' hold together ' the whole of this investigation, namely, (1) when certain
                    objects present an appearance of such a kind that other objects also could
                    present the same appearance without there being any difference between these
                    presentations, it is impossible that the one set of objects should be capable of
                    being perceived and the other set not capable; but (2), not only in a case in
                    which they are alike in every particular is there no difference between them,
                    but also in a case in which they cannot be distinguished apart. Having set out
                    these propositions, they include the whole issue within a single syllogistic
                    argument; this argument is constructed as follows: ' Some presentations are
                    true, others false; and what is false cannot be perceived. But a true
                    presentation is invariably of such a sort that a false presentation also could
                    be of exactly the same sort; and among presentations of such a sort that there
                    is no difference between them, it cannot occur that some are capable of being
                    perceived and others are not. Therefore there is no presentation that is capable
                    of being perceived.'<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a Two objects
                        entirely alike, A' and A", present the same appearance a; but so also do two
                        objects only superficially alike—though not really alike entirely, they are
                        indistinguishable by the senses: X and Y both present the same appearance x.
                        We may have the presentation x and think it comes from X when it really
                        comes from Y, X not being there: in this case we do not perceive X.
                        Therefore when we have the presentation x and think it comes from X and X is
                        there, we cannot be said to perceive X. Therefore perception is
                        impossible.</note>
                    <note type="margin">41</note> Now of the propositions that they take as
                    premisses from which to infer the desired conclusion, two they assume to be
                    granted, and indeed nobody disputes them: these are, that false presentations
                    cannot be perceived, and the second, that of presentations that have no
                    difference between them it is impossible that some should be such as to be
                    capable of being perceived and others such as to be incapable. But the remaining
                    premisses they defend with a long and varied discourse, these also being two,
                    one, that of the objects of presentations some are true, others false, and the
                    other, that every presentation arising from a true object is </p>

                <pb n="521"/>
                <p> of such a nature that it could also arise from a false object. <note
                        type="margin">42</note> These two propositions they do not skim over, but
                    develop with a considerable application of care and industry; they divide them
                    into sections, and those of wide extent: first, sensations; next, inferences
                    from sensations and from general experience, which they deem to lack clarity;
                    then they come to the section proving the impossibility of perceiving anything
                    even by means of reasoning and inference. These general propositions they cut up
                    into still smaller divisions, employing the same method with all the other
                    topics as you saw in yesterday's discourse that they do with sensation, and
                    aiming at proving in the case of each subject, minutely subdivided, that all
                    true presentations are coupled with false ones in no way differing from the
                    true, and that this being the nature of sense-presentations, to comprehend them
                    is impossible. <note type="margin">(6)Preliminary criticism of the New Academy:

                    established and certain, not of those who loudly proclaim that they are no more
                    true than false. For what would they do if, when they have defined something,

                    to any other thing you like? If they say it can, what proof could they put

                    definition can be perceived, and this they will not allow at any price. The same

                        init.</note> of presentations, they will confess that they can ' comprehend
                    ' them. But if they maintain that true presentations cannot be distinguished
                    from false ones, how will they be able to advance any further? for they will be
                    met as they were met before; since valid inference is not possible unless you
                    accept the propositions taken as premisses as so fully proved that there cannot
                    possibly be any false propositions that resemble them: therefore if a process of
                    reasoning that has carried through its procedure on the basis of things grasped
                    and perceived arrives at the conclusion that nothing can be grasped, what more
                    self-destructive argument could be discovered? And when the very nature of
                    accurate discourse professes the intention of revealing something that is not
                    apparent, and of employing sensations and manifest presentations to facilitate
                    the attainment of this result, what are we to make of the language of these
                    thinkers who hold that everything does not so much exist as seem to exist? But
                    they are most completely refuted when they assume as mutually consistent these
                    two propositions that are so violently discrepant, first, that some
                    presentations are false, a view that clearly implies that some are true, and

                    and evident are encountered by two obstacles, it is necessary to array against
                    them the same number of assistances. The first obstacle is that people do not
                    fix and concentrate their minds on the perspicuous objects enough to be able to
                    recognize in how much light they are enveloped; the second is that certain

                <p> defence of perspicuity, and to be armed so that we may be able to meet their
                    arguments and shatter their captions; and this I have decided on as my next
                    step. <note type="margin">47</note> I will therefore set out their arguments in
                    classified form, since even they themselves make a practice of orderly
                    exposition. They first attempt to show the possibility that many things may
                    appear to exist that are absolutely non-existent, since the mind is deceptively
                    affected by non-existent objects in the same manner as it is affected by real
                    ones. For, they say, when your school asserts that some presentations are sent
                    by the deity—dreams for example, and the revelations furnished by oracles,
                    auspices and sacrifices (for they assert that the Stoics against whom they are
                    arguing accept these manifestations)—how possibly, they ask, can the deity have
                    the power to render false presentations probable and not have the power to
                    render probable those which approximate absolutely most closely to the truth? or
                    else, if he is able to render these also probable, why cannot he render probable
                    those which are distinguishable, although only with extreme difficulty, from
                    false presentations? and if these, why not those which do not differ from them
                    at all? <note type="margin">48</note> Then, since the mind is capable of
                    entirely self-originated motion, as is manifest by our faculty of mental
                    imagination and by the visions that sometimes appear to men either when asleep
                    or mad, it is probable that the mind may also be set in motion in such a manner
                    that not only it cannot distinguish whether the presentations in question are
                    true or false but that there really is no difference at all between them: just
                    as if people were to shiver and turn pale either of themselves as a result of
                    some mental emotion or in consequence </p>

                <p> of encountering some terrifying external object, with nothing to distinguish

                    between the internal state of feeling and the one that came from without.
                    Lastly, if no false presentations at all are probable, it is another story; but
                    if some are, why are not even those that are difficult to distinguish? why not
                    those that are so much like true ones that there is absolutely no difference
                    between them? especially as you yourselves say that the wise man when in a state
                    of frenzy restrains himself from all assent because no distinction between
                    presentations is visible to him. <note type="margin">These fallacies exposed:

                    employing an exceedingly captious kind of argument, of a sort that is usually by
                    no means approved of in philosophy—the method of proceeding by minute steps of

                    dishonourable ones and some good things like not good ones and some artistic
                    things like inartistic ones; why do we hesitate therefore to aver that there is
                    no difference between these? Have we no eye even for incongruities? for there is
                    nothing that cannot be carried over from its own class into another class. But
                    if it were proved that there is no difference between presentations of different
                    classes, we should find presentations that belonged both to their own class and
                    to one foreign to them; how can this possibly occur? <note type="margin"
                        >51</note> Consequently there is only one way of routing the difficulty
                    about unreal presentations, whether depicted by the imagination, which we admit
                    frequently to take place, or in slumber or under the influence of wine or of
                    insanity: we shall declare that all presentations of this nature are devoid of
                    perspicuity, to which we are bound to cling tooth and nail. For who when
                    feigning to himself an imaginary picture of some object, the moment he bestirs
                    himself and recalls his self-consciousness does not at once perceive the

                    appearance as the visual presentations that we experience while awake! To begin
                    with, there is a difference between them; but do not let us dwell on that, for
                    our point is that when we are asleep we have not the same mental or sensory

                    are doubtful and hesitating and sometimes pull themselves up, and they give a

                    restrains himself from accepting false presentations as true. So indeed he often
                    does on other occasions, if his own senses happen to contain an element of
                    heaviness or slowness, or if the presentations are rather obscure, or if he is
                    debarred by lack of time from a close scrutiny. Although this admission, that
                    the wise man sometimes withholds his assent, goes wholly against your school;
                    for if presentations were indistinguishable, he would either withhold his assent
                    always or never. But out of all this what is ' perspicuous ' is the lack of
                    substance in the case put by these thinkers, who aspire to introduce universal
                    confusion. What we are looking for is a canon of judgement proper to dignity and
                    consistency, to firmness and wisdom, what we find are instances taken from
                    dreamers, lunatics and drunkards. Do we notice in all this department how
                    inconsistent that talk is? If we did, we should not bring forward people who are
                    tipsy or fast asleep or out of their minds in such a ridiculous fashion as at
                    one moment to say that there is a difference between the presentations of the

                    yourself. Are you aware that the likeness of one egg to another is proverbial?
                    yet we have been told that at Delos at the time of its prosperity a number of
                    people were in the habit of keeping large numbers of hens for trade purposes;
                    these poultry-keepers used to be able to tell which hen had laid an egg by
                    merely looking at it. <note type="margin">58</note> Nor does that go against us,
                    for we are content not to be able to know 7 those eggs apart, since to agree
                    that this egg is the same as that egg, is nevertheless not the same thing as if
                    there really were no distinction between them; for I possess a standard enabling
                    me to judge presentations to be true when they have a character of a sort that
                    false ones could not have; from that standard I may not diverge a finger's
                    breadth, as the saying is, lest I should cause universal confusion. For not only
                    the knowledge but even the nature of true and false will be done away with if
                    there is no difference between them, so that even the remark that you have a way
                    of occasionally making will be absurd—namely, that what you assert is not that
                    when presentations are impressed on to the mind there is no difference between
                    the imprints themselves, but that there is no difference between their '

                    commit an error. For my part, moreover, certain as I am that something exists
                    that can be grasped (the point I have been arguing even too long already), I am

                    as he had in fact done all through Lucullus's discourse, frequently even raising
                    his hands in wonder (and that was not surprising, for I do not think the case
                    against the Academy had ever been argued with more minute precision), began to
                    exhort me also, whether in jest or earnest (for I could not quite make out), to
                    abandon my opinion. Thereupon Catulus said to me, " If Lucullus's speech has won
                    you over—and its delivery showed memory, concentration and fluency—, I am
                    silent, and I do not think you ought to be frightened away from changing your
                    opinion if you think fit to do so. But I should not advise your letting his
                    authority influence you; for he all but warned you just now," he said with a
                    smile at me, " to be on your guard lest some wicked tribune of the people—and
                    what a plentiful supply there will always be of them you are well aware— should
                    arraign you, and cross-examine you in a public assembly as to your consistency
                    in both denying the possibility of finding anything certain and asserting that
                    you had discovered some certainty. Pray don't be alarmed by this; but as to the
                    actual merits of the case, although I should it is true prefer you to disagree
                    with him, if you give in I shall not be greatly I surprised, for I remember that

                    I usually do when I have a specially big case on, began what was almost a set
                    speech on the following lines. "For my part, Catulus, Lucullus's speech on the
                    actual merits of the issue has affected me as that of a scholarly, fluent and
                    well-equipped person who passes by none of the arguments that can be advanced in
                    support of the case put forward, though all the same not to the point of my
                    distrusting my ability to answer him; yet his great authority was unquestionably
                    working upon me, had you not set against it your authority which is no smaller.
                    I will therefore set about it, after a few preliminary remarks on the subject of
                    my own reputation, if I may use the term. <note type="margin">(1) Prefatory: his
                        own desire for truth.</note>
                    <note type="margin">65</note> For if my own motive in choosing this particular
                    school of philosophy for my adherence was some of ostentation or combativeness,
                    I consider that not merely my folly but even my moral character deserves
                    condemnation. For if in the most trifling matters we censure obstinacy and
                    actually punish chicanery, am I likely to want either to join battle with others
                    for the sake of fighting, or to deceive not only others but myself also, when
                    the entire system and principle of the whole of life is the issue? Accordingly
                    unless I thought it foolish in such a discussion to do what is customary
                    occasionally in political controversy, I should swear by Jove and the gods of my
                    household that I am fired with zeal for the discovery of the truth, and that I
                    really hold the opinions that I am stating. <note type="margin">66</note> For
                    how can I fail to be eager for the discovery of truth, when I rejoice if I </p>

                <p> have discovered something that resembles truth? But just as I deem it supremely
                    honourable to hold true views, so it is supremely disgraceful to approve
                    falsehoods as true. And nevertheless I myself am not the sort of person never to
                    give approval to anything false, never give absolute assent, never hold an
                    opinion; it is the wise man that we are investigating. For my own part however,
                    although I am a great opinion-holder<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite"

                    which I steer my thinking is not by that tiny star, the Cynosure, in which
                    Phoenicians place their trust by night To guide them on the deep, as Aratus<note

                    they keep to her who revolves upon An inner circle and an orbit brief, but by
                    Helicē and the resplendent Septentriones, that is, by these theories of wider
                    aspect, not fined down and over-subtilized. The result is that I roam and wander
                    more widely; but it is not I, as I said, but the wise man that is the subject of
                    our inquiry. For when the presentations you talk of have struck my mind or my
                    sense sharply I accept them, and sometimes I actually give assent to them
                    (though nevertheless I do not perceive them, for I hold that nothing can be
                    perceived)—I am not a wise man, and so I yield to presentations and cannot stand
                    out against them; whereas the strongest point of the wise man, in the opinion of
                    Arcesilas, agreeing with Zeno, lies in avoiding being taken in and in seeing
                    that he is not deceived—for nothing is more removed from the conception that we

                <p> the dignity of the wise man than error, frivolity or rashness. What then shall I
                    say about the wise man's firmness? even you, Lucullus, allow that he never
                    advances a mere opinion. And since you agree with this (to deal with you out of
                    turn: I will soon return to a regular procedure), consider first the validity of
                    this syllogism: <note type="margin">The danger of 'assent.</note>

                    anything, he will sometimes also form an opinion; but he never will form an
                    opinion; therefore he will not assent to anything.' This syllogism Arcesilas
                    used to approve, for he used to accept both the major premiss and the minor
                    (Carneades used sometimes to grant as minor premiss that the wise man sometimes
                    assents, so that it followed that he also holds an opinion, which you will not
                    allow, and rightly, as I think). But the major premiss, that if the wise man did
                    assent he would also hold an opinion, both the Stoics and their supporter
                    Antiochus declare to be false, arguing that the wise man is able to distinguish
                    the false from the true and the imperceptible from the perceptible. <note
                        type="margin">68</note> But in our view, in the first place, even if
                    anything could be, perceived, nevertheless the mere habit of assenting appears
                    dangerous and slippery, and therefore since it is agreed that to give assent to
                    anything that is either false or unknown is so serious a fault, preferably all
                    assent is to be withheld, to avoid having a serious fall if one goes forward
                    rashly; for things false lie so close to things true, and things that cannot be
                    perceived to things that can (assuming there are such things, winch we shall see
                    soon), that it is the duty of the wise man not to trust himself to such a steep
                    slope. But if on the contrary I assume on my own authority that there is nothing
                    at all that can be </p>

                <p> perceived, and accept your admission that the wise man forms no opinion, this
                    will prove that the wise man will restrain all acts of assent, so that you will
                    have to consider whether you prefer this view or the view that the wise man will
                    hold some opinion. ' Neither of those views,' you will say. Let us therefore
                    stress the point that nothing can be perceived, for it is on that that all the
                    controversy turns. <note type="margin">Argumentum ad hominem</note>

                    with Antiochus, who studied under Philo the very doctrines that I am championing
                    for such a long time that it was agreed that nobody had studied them longer, and
                    who also wrote upon these subjects -with the greatest penetration, and who
                    nevertheless in his old age denounced this system, not more keenly than he had
                    previously been in the habit of defending it. Although therefore he may have
                    been penetrating, as indeed he was, nevertheless lack of constancy does diminish
                    the weight of authority. For I am curious to know the exact date of the day
                    whose dawning light revealed to him that mark of truth and falsehood which he
                    had for many years been in the habit of denying. Did he think out something
                    original? His pronouncements are the same as those of the Stoics. Did he become
                    dissatisfied with his former opinions? Why did he not transfer himself to
                    another school, and most of all why not to the Stoics? for that disagreement
                    with Philo was the special tenet of the Stoic school. What, was he dissatisfied
                    with Mnesarchus? or with Dardanus? they were the leaders of the Stoics at Athens
                    at the time. He never quitted Philo, except after he began to have an audience
                    of his own. <note type="margin">70</note> But why this sudden revival of the Old
                    Academy? It is thought that he wanted to retain </p>

                <pb n="557"/>
                <p> the dignity of the name in spite of abandoning the reality—for in fact some
                    persons did aver that his motive was ostentation, and even that he hoped that
                    his following would be styled the School of Antiochus. But I am more inclined to
                    think that he was unable to withstand the united attack of all the philosophers
                    (for although they have certain things in common on all other subjects, this is
                    the one doctrine of the Academics that no one of the other schools approves);
                    and accordingly he gave way, and, just like people who cannot bear the sun under

                    <note type="margin">71</note> And as to the argument that he was in the habit of
                    employing at the period when he held that nothing could be perceived, which
                    consisted in asking which of his two doctrines had the famous Dionysius of
                    Heraclea grasped by means of that unmistakable mark which according to your
                    school ought to be the foundation of assent—the doctrine that he had held for
                    many years and had accepted on the authority of his master Zeno, that only the
                    morally honourable is good, or the doctrine that he had made a practice of
                    defending afterwards, that morality is an empty name, and that the supreme good
                    is pleasure?—in spite of Antiochus's attempt to prove from Dionysius's change of
                    opinion that no impression can be printed on our minds by a true presentation of
                    a character that cannot also be caused by a false one, he yet ensured that the
                    argument which he himself had drawn from Dionysius should be drawn by everybody

                    against the arrogance of those who dare to say that they know, seeing that
                    nothing can be known. Also you said<note type="footnote" n="b" place="opposite"

                    can I speak with more certain knowledge about any persons? I seem to have
                    actually lived with them, so many dialogues have been put in writing which make
                    it impossible to doubt that Socrates held that nothing can be known; he made
                    only one exception, no more—he said that he did know that he knew nothing. Why
                    should I speak about Plato? he certainly would not have set out these doctrines
                    in so many volumes if he had not accepted them, for otherwise there was no sense
                    in setting out the irony of the other master, especially as it was unending.

                    so many able minds carrying on the search with such zealous energy, after so
                    many ages since the old philosophers mentioned, the truth might possibly have
                    been discovered. What actually has been discovered permit me to consider a
                    little later, with you yourself indeed as umpire. But that Arcesilas did not do
                    battle with Zeno merely for the sake of criticizing him, but really wished to
                    discover the truth, is gathered from what follows. <note type="margin">77</note>
                    That it is possible for a human being to hold no opinions, and not only </p>

                <pb n="565"/>
                <p> that it is possible but that it is the duty of the wise man, had not only never
                    been distinctly formulated but had never even been stated by any of his
                    predecessors; but Arcesilas deemed this view both true and also honourable and
                    worthy of a wise man. We may suppose him putting the question to Zeno, what
                    would happen if the wise man was unable to perceive anything and if also it was
                    the mark of the wise man not to form an opinion. Zeno no doubt replied that the
                    wise man's reason for abstaining from forming an opinion would be that there was
                    something that could be perceived. What then was this? asked Arcesilas. A
                    presentation, was doubtless the answer. Then what sort of a presentation?
                    Hereupon no doubt Zeno defined it as follows, a presentation impressed and
                    sealed and moulded from a real object, in conformity with its reality. There
                    followed the further question, did this hold good even if a true presentation
                    was of exactly the same form as a false one? At this I imagine Zeno was sharp
                    enough to see that if a presentation proceeding from a real thing was of such a
                    nature that one proceeding from a non-existent thing could be of the same form,
                    there was no presentation that could be perceived. Arcesilas agreed that this
                    addition to the definition was correct, for it was impossible to perceive either
                    a false presentation or a true one if a true one had such a character as even a
                    false one might have; but he pressed the points at issue further in order to
                    show that no presentation proceeding from a true object is such that a
                    presentation proceeding from a false one might not also be of the same form.
                        <note type="margin">78</note> This is the one argument that has held the
                    field down to the present day. For the point that the wise man will </p>

                <pb n="567"/>
                <p> not assent to anything had no essential bearing on this dispute; for he might
                    perceive nothing and yet form an opinion—a view which is said to have been
                    accepted by Carneades; although for my own part, trusting Clitomachus more than
                    Philo or Metrodorus, I believe that Carneades did not so much accept this view
                    as advance it in argument. But let us drop that point. If the acts of opining
                    and perceiving are abolished, it undoubtedly follows that all acts of assent
                    must be withheld, so that if I succeed in proving that nothing can be perceived,
                    you must admit that the wise man will never assent. <note type="margin">(4) Even

                    I had gone out of my way yesterday to say so much against the senses. Yet you
                        assert<note type="footnote" n="b" place="opposite">b See § 19.</note> that
                    the broken oar and the pigeon's neck don't upset you. In the first place why?
                    for in the instance of the oar I perceive that what is seen is not real, and in
                    that of the pigeon that several colours are seen and really there are not more
                    than one. In the next place, surely we said much beside that! Suppose all our

                    you always have an authority, and one to risk his all in defence of the cause!
                    for Epicurus brings the issue to this point, that if one sense has told a lie
                    once in a man's life, no sense must ever be believed. <note type="margin"

                    allowed to be true to his intellectual ancestry; but as for you, who say that
                    some sense-presentations are true and some false, how do you distinguish them
                    apart? And do pray desist from mere stock arguments: those are products we have
                    a home supply of! If a god, you say, were to inquire of you whether, given
                    healthy and sound senses, you want anything more, what would you reply? Indeed I
                    wish he would make the inquiry! he would be told how badly he was dealing with
                    us! For even granting that our sight is accurate, how wide is its range? I can
                    make out Catulus's place at Cumae from where we are, and can see it straight in
                    front of me, but I can't make out his villa at Pompei, although there is nothing
                    in between to block the view, but my sight is not able to carry any further. O
                    what a glorious view! We can see Puteoli, but we can't see our friend Gaius

                    and which also themselves cannot see us above them; it follows that we are shut

                    is on which the issue turns. There are four heads of argument intended to prove
                    that there is nothing that can be known, perceived or comprehended, which is the
                    subject of all this debate: the first of these arguments is that there is such a

                <p> as a false presentation; the second, that a false presentation cannot be

                    it is impossible for some to be able to be perceived and others not; the fourth,
                    that there is no true presentation originating from sensation with which there
                    is not ranged another presentation that precisely corresponds to it and that
                    cannot be perceived.<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a Identical

                    presentation of a sort that could not be perceived, because there was no mark to
                    distinguish a true presentation from a false one; and if that mode of
                    distinguishing were removed, what mark would he have, of such a sort that it
                    could not be false, to help him to recognize Gaius Cotta, who was twice consul
                    with Geminus? You say that so great a degree of resemblance does not exist in
                    the world. You show fight, no doubt, but you have an easy-going opponent; let us
                    grant by all means that it does not exist, but undoubtedly it can appear to
                    exist, and therefore it will cheat the sense, and if a single ease of
                    resemblance has done that, it will have made everything doubtful; for when that
                    proper canon of recognition has been removed, even if the man himself whom you

                    something that is not real appears to be real? You say that everything is in a

                    These assertions can be refuted, but I don't want to fight; for it makes no
                    difference to the point at issue whether an object completely within sight does
                    not differ at all from another or cannot be distinguished from it even if it
                    does differ. But if so great a resemblance between human beings is impossible,

                    have been filled not only by our school but also by Chrysippus; of whom the
                    Stoics are in the habit of complaining that, while he carefully sought out all
                    the facts that told against the senses and their clarity and against the whole
                    of common experience and against reason, when answering himself he got the worst

                <p> There are similar passages about men tipsy. As if anybody would deny that a man

                    has subsided thinks that the things that he saw during his madness were not
                    true! But that is not the point at issue; what we are asking is what these
                    things looked like at the time when they were seen. Unless indeed we think that,

                    how far to go in any matter; and this is so not only in the case of a heap of

                    asked by gradual stages, is such and such a person a rich man or a poor man,
                    famous or undistinguished, are yonder objects many or few, great or small, long
                    or short, broad or narrow, we do not know at what point in the addition or

                    that the sōrites is erroneous. Smash the sōrites then, if you can, so that it
                    may not get you into trouble, for it will if you don't take precautions. '
                    Precautions have been taken,' says he, ' for the policy of Chrysippus is, when
                    questioned step by step whether (for example) 3 is few or many, a little before
                    he gets to " many," to come to rest, or, as they term it, hēsychazein.' ' So far
                    as I am concerned,' says Carneades, ' you may not only rest but even snore; but
                    what's the good of that? for next comes somebody bent on rousing you from
                    slumber and carrying on the cross-examination: If I add 1 to the number at which
                    you became silent, will that make many?"—you will go forward again as far as you
                    think fit.' Why say more? for you admit my point, that you cannot specify in
                    your answers either the place where ' a few ' stops or that where ' many '
                    begins; and this class of error spreads so widely that I don't see where it may
                    not get to. <note type="margin">94</note> ' It doesn't </p>

                    to is precipitous: I pull up in time as he does,' says he, ' and when captious
                    questions are put I don't reply any more.' If you have a solution of the problem
                    and won't reply, that is an arrogant way of acting, but if you haven't, you too
                    don't perceive the matter; if because of its obscurity, I give in, but you say
                    that you don't go forward till you get to a point that is obscure. If so, you
                    come to a stop at things that are clear. If you do so merely in order to be
                    silent, you don't score anything, for what does it matter to the adversary who
                    wants to trap you whether you are silent or speaking when he catches you in his
                    net? but if on the contrary you keep on answering ' few ' as far as 9,let us
                    say, without hesitating, but stop at 10, you are withholding assent even from
                    propositions that are certain, nay, clear as daylight; but you don't allow me to
                    do exactly the same in the case of things that are obscure. Consequently that

                    dialectic that every statement (termed by them axiōma, that is, a ' proposition
                    ') is either true or false; what then? is this a true proposition or a false

                    or false, what becomes of the definition of a ' proposition ' as ' that which is
                    either true or false '? Taking certain premisses I will draw the conclusion
                    that, of two sets of propositions, to be classed as contradictory, one set is to
                    be adopted and the other set to be rejected.<note type="footnote" n="b"

                    light; but you do say that it is light now and speak the truth; therefore it is
                    light'? Your school undoubtedly approve this class of syllogism and say that it
                    is completely valid, and accordingly it is the first mode of proof that you give
                    in your lectures. Either therefore you will approve of every syllogism in the
                    same mode, or that science of yours is no good. Consider therefore whether you
                    will approve the following syllogism: ' If you say that you are lying and speak
                    the truth, you are lying; but you do say that you are lying and speak the truth;
                    therefore you are lying '; how can you not approve this syllogism when you
                    approved the previous one of the same class? These fallacies are the inventions
                    of Chrysippus, and even he himself could not solve them; for what could he make
                    of this syllogism—' If it is light, it is light; but it is light; therefore it
                    is light '? Of course he would agree; for the very nature of hypothetical
                    inference compels you to grant the conclusion if you have granted the premiss.

                    science, reason, method, in fact if the syllogistic proof is valid, it is the
                    same in either case. <note type="margin">97</note> But the farthest length they
                    go is to demand that these insoluble problems should be deemed an exception. My
                    advice to them is to apply to some tribune<note type="footnote" n="a"
                        place="opposite">a In civil buits the praetor did not try the facts but
                        issued an instruction to an inferior court to cast the defendant if certain
                        facts were proved, and sometimes also unless certain other facts were
                        proved: the latter clause was an exceptio. If the praetor refused to grant
                        an exceptio, the defendant might appeal to a tribune, who could procure the
                        grant by<pb n="591"/> threatening if it were not given to annul the whole of

                    ' from me. For as they will not get Epicurus, who despises and laughs at the
                    whole of dialectic, to admit the validity of a proposition of the form '
                    Hermarchus will either be alive to-morrow or not alive,' whereas dialecticians
                    lay it down that every disjunctive proposition of the form ' either x or not-a-
                    ' is not only valid but even necessary, see how on his guard the man is whom
                    your friends think slow; for ' If,' he says, ' I admit either of the two to be
                    necessary, it will follow that Hermarchus must either be alive tomorrow or not
                    alive; but as a matter of fact in the nature of things no such necessity
                    exists.' Therefore let the dialecticians, that is, Antiochus and the Stoics, do
                    battle with this philosopher, for he overthrows the whole of dialectic, if a
                    disjunctive proposition consisting of two contrary statements—' contrary '
                    meaning one of them affirmative, the other negative—if a disjunctive proposition
                    of this sort can be false, none is true; <note type="margin">98</note> but what
                    quarrel have they with me, who am a disciple of their own school? When any
                    situation of this nature occurred, Carneades used to play with the matter thus:
                    ' If my conclusion is </p>

                        a minor Stoic, a Babylonian; he went with Carneades to Rome on the famous

                    and that was the fee of professors of that subject). I therefore am following
                    the methods of procedure that I learnt from Antiochus, and I cannot make out how
                    I am to form the judgement that the proposition ' If it is light, it is light '
                    is a true one (because I was taught that every hypothetical inference is true),
                    but not form the judgement that ' If you are lying, you are lying ' is an
                    inference on the same lines. Either therefore I shall make both the former
                    judgement and the latter one, or, if not the former, not the latter either.

                        n="b" place="opposite">b Cf. § 75.</note> and to display our real position,
                    as soon as the whole system of Carneades has been unfolded the doctrines of your
                    Antiochus will come to the ground in complete collapse. However, I will not
                    assert anything in such a manner that anybody may suspect me of inventing; I
                    shall take it from Clitomachus, who was a companion of Carneades quite until old
                    age, a clever fellow as being a Carthaginian, and also extremely studious and
                    industrious. There are four volumes of his that deal with the withholding of
                    assent, but what I am now going to say has been taken from Volume One. <note
                        type="margin">99</note> Carneades holds that there are two classifications
                    of presentations, which under one are divided into those that can be perceived
                    and those that cannot, and under the other into those that are probable and
                    those that are not probable<note type="footnote" n="c" place="opposite">c
                        φαντασίαι καταληπτικαί and ἀκατάληπτοι, πιθαναί and ἀπίθανοι.</note>; and
                    that accordingly those presentations that are styled by the Academy contrary to
                    the senses and contrary to perspicuity belong to the former division, whereas
                    the latter division </p>

                <pb n="595"/>
                <p> must not be impugned; and that consequently his view is that there is no
                    presentation of such a sort as to result in perception, but many that result in
                    a judgement of probability. For it is contrary to nature for nothing to be
                    probable, and entails that entire subversion of life of which you, Lucullus,
                    were speaking<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a §§ 31, 53,
                        58.</note>; accordingly even many sense - percepts must be deemed probable,
                    if only it be held in mind that no sense-presentation has such a character as a
                    false presentation could not also have without differing from it at all. Thus
                    the wise man will make use of whatever apparently probable presentation he
                    encounters, if nothing presents itself that is contrary to that probability, and
                    his whole plan of life will be charted out in this manner. In fact even the
                    person whom your school brings on the stage as the wise man follows many things
                    probable, that he has not grasped nor perceived nor assented to but that possess
                    verisimilitude; and if he were not to approve them, all life would be done away
                    with. <note type="margin">100</note> Another point: when a wise man is going on
                    board a ship surely he has not got the knowledge already grasped in his mind and
                    perceived that he will make the voyage as he intends? how can he have it? But if
                    for instance he were setting out from here to Puteoli, a distance of four miles,
                    with a reliable crew and a good helmsman and in the present calm weather, it
                    would appear probable that he would get there safe. He will therefore be guided
                    by presentations of this sort to adopt plans of action and of inaction, and will
                    be readier at proving that snow is white than Anaxagoras was (who not only
                    denied that this was so, but asserted that to him snow did not even appear
                    white, because he knew that it was made of water solidified and that </p>

                <pb n="597"/>
                <p> water was black); <note type="margin">101</note> and whatever object comes in
                    contact with him in such a way that the presentation is probable, and unhindered
                    by anything, he will be set in motion. For he is not a statue carved out of
                    stone or hewn out of timber; he has a body and a mind, a mobile intellect and
                    mobile senses, so that many things seem to him to be true, although nevertheless
                    they do not seem to him to possess that distinct and peculiar mark leading to
                    perception, and hence the doctrine that the wise man does not assent, for the
                    reason that it is possible for a false presentation to occur that has the same
                    character as a given true one. Nor does our pronouncement against the senses
                    differ from that of the Stoics, who say that many things are false and widely
                    different from what they appear to the senses. <note type="margin">Certainty is

                    Thus a single first principle of Epicurus combined with another belonging to
                    your school results in the abolition of perception and comprehension, without
                    our uttering a word. What is the principle of Epicurus? ' If any
                    sense-presentation is false, nothing can be perceived.' What is yours? ' There
                    are false sense-presentations.' What follows? Without any word of mine, logical
                    inference of itself declares that nothing can be perceived. ' I do not admit
                    Epicurus's point,' says he. Well then, fight it out with Epicurus—he differs
                    from you entirely; don't join issue with me, who at all events agree with you so
                    far as to hold that there is an element of falsehood in the senses. <note

                <p> asserted, especially indeed by Antiochus, who was perfectly well acquainted with
                    the arguments that I stated a little before. For even though anybody at his own
                    discretion may criticize our statement that nothing can be perceived, that is a
                    less serious criticism; but it is our assertion that there are some things that
                    are probable that seems to your school to be inadequate. It may be; anyhow it is
                    certainly up to us to get round the difficulties that you raised with the
                    greatest insistency: 'Do you then see nothing? do you hear nothing? is nothing
                    clear to you? ' I quoted from Clitomachus a little earlier an explanation of the
                    way in which Carneades treated the difficulties you refer to; let me give you
                    the way in which the same points are dealt with by Clitomachus in the volume
                    that he wrote to the poet Gaius Lucilius, although he had written on the same
                    subjects to the Lucius Censorinus who was Manius Manilius's colleague in the
                        consulship.<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a 149 B.C.</note> He
                    wrote then in almost these words—for I am familiar with them, because the
                    primary ' system ' or doctrine <note type="footnote" n="b" place="opposite">b
                        Quasi marks disciplina as an explanation of institutio used to translate
                        some Greek term, perhaps σύστημα.</note> which we are dealing with is
                    contained in that book—but it runs as follows: <note type="margin">103</note> '
                    The Academic school holds that there are dissimilarities between things of such
                    a nature that some of them seem probable and others the contrary; but this is
                    not an adequate ground for saying that some things can be perceived and others
                    cannot, because many false objects are probable but nothing false can be
                    perceived and known.' And accordingly he asserts that those who say that the
                    Academy robs us of our senses are violently mistaken, as that school never said
                    that colour, taste or sound was non-existent, but their contention was that
                    these presentations do not contain a mark of truth and </p>

                <pb n="601"/>
                <p> certainty peculiar to themselves and found nowhere else. <note type="margin"
                        >104</note> After setting out these points, he adds that the formula ' the
                    wise man withholds assent ' is used in two ways, one when the meaning is that he
                    gives absolute assent to no presentation at all, the other when he restrains
                    himself from replying so as to convey approval or disapproval of something, with
                    the consequence that he neither makes a negation nor an affirmation; and that
                    this being so, he holds the one plan in theory, so that he never assents, but
                    the other in practice, so that he is guided by probability, and wherever this
                    confronts him or is wanting he can answer ' yes ' or ' no ' accordingly. In fact
                    as we hold that he who restrains himself from assent about all things
                    nevertheless does move and does act, the view is that there remain presentations
                    of a sort that arouse us to action, and also answers that we can give in the
                    affirmative or the negative in reply to questions, merely following a
                    corresponding presentation, provided that we answer without actual assent; but
                    that nevertheless not all presentations of this character were actually
                    approved, but those that nothing hindered. <note type="margin">105</note> If we
                    do not win your approval for these doctrines, they may no doubt be false, but
                    certainly they are not detestable. For we don't rob you of daylight, but,
                    whereas you speak of things as being' perceived ' and ' grasped,' we describe
                    the same things (provided they are probable) as ' appearing.' <note

                    and sea with the same eyes as the wise man of your school, and will perceive
                    with the same senses the rest of the objects that fall under each of them.
                    Yonder sea that now with the west wind rising looks purple, will look the same
                    to our wise man, though at the same time he will not ' assent ' to the
                    sensation, because even to ourselves it looked blue just now and tomorrow it
                    will look grey, and because now where the sun lights it up it whitens and
                    shimmers and is unlike the part immediately adjoining, so that even if you are
                    able to explain why this occurs, you nevertheless cannot maintain that the
                    appearance that was presented to your eyes was true! <note type="margin"

                    come to believe that all geometry is false, surely he did not forget even the
                    knowledge that he possessed? Yet what is false cannot be perceived, as you
                    yourselves hold; if therefore the objects of memory are things perceived and
                    comprehended, all the things a man remembers he holds grasped and perceived; but
                    nothing false can be grasped, and Siro remembers all the doctrines of Epicurus;
                    therefore in the present state of things those doctrines are all true. This may
                    be so as far as I am concerned; but you are either bound to allow that it is so,
                    which is the last thing you are willing to do, or you must grant me memory and

                    perspicuous.' Seeing that Panaetius, who in my judgement at all events is almost
                    the chief of the Stoics, says that he is in doubt as to the matter which all the

                    restrains himself from assent, which he can do even about things that his own
                    teachers held to be certain, why should not the wise man be able to do so about
                    everything else? Is there any proposition that he can either reject or approve,
                    but is not able to doubt? will you be able to do so with sōrites arguments when

                    Clitomachus when he writes that Carneades really did accomplish an almost
                    Herculean labour in ridding our minds of that fierce wild beast, the act of
                    assent, that is of mere opinion and hasty thinking, nevertheless (to abandon
                    that section of the defence) what will hamper the activity of the man that
                    follows probabilities when nothing hampers? <note type="margin">109</note> 'The
                    very fact,' says he,' that he will decide that not even what he approves can be

                    going a voyage, in sowing a crop, in marrying a wife, in begetting a family, in
                    ever so many things in which you will be following nothing but probability. "
                    And putting that aside, you repeat the old, familiar and oft-rejected argument,
                    not in Anti-pater's manner, but as you say ' coming more to grips with it '<note
                        type="footnote" n="b" place="opposite">b § 29.</note>; for Antipater, you
                    tell us, was censured for saying that it was consistent for one who asserted
                    that nothing could be grasped to say that that assertion itself could be
                    grasped. This seemed stupid and self-contradictory even to Antiochus; for it
                    cannot consistently be said that nothing can be grasped if anything is said to
                    be able to be grasped. The way in which Antiochus thinks Carneades should
                    preferably have been attacked was this—to make him admit that, since the wise
                    man can have no </p>

                    that it is the decision of the wise man that nothing can be perceived, is
                    perceived. Just as if the wise man held no other decision and could conduct his

                    <note type="margin">110</note> On the contrary, he holds this particular
                    opinion, that nothing can be perceived, in just the same way as he holds the '

                    mark of knowledge in this case, he would employ the same mark in all other
                    cases, but since he has not got it, he employs probabilities. Thus he is not
                    afraid lest he may appear to throw everything into confusion and make everything
                    uncertain. For if a question be put to him about duty or about a number of other
                    matters in which practice has made him an expert, he would not reply in the same
                    way as he would if questioned as to whether the number of the stars is even or
                    odd, and say that he did not know; for in things uncertain there is nothing
                    probable, but in things where there is probability the wise man will not be at a
                    loss either what to do or what to answer. <note type="margin">111</note> Nor
                    yet, Lucullus, did you pass over the criticism made by Antiochus<note

                    is one of the most famous—which Antiochus used to say Philo had found most
                    upsetting: it was that when the assumption was made, first, that there were some
                    false presentations, and secondly, that they differed in no respect from true
                    ones, Philo failed to notice that whereas he had admitted the former proposition
                    on the strength of the apparent existence of a certain difference among
                    presentations, this fact was refuted by the latter proposition, his denial that

                <p> from false ones; and that no procedure could be more inconsistent. This would
                    hold good if we abolished truth altogether; but we do not, for we observe some
                    things that are true just as we observe some that are false. But there is '

                    is too cramped. For when there is a wide field in which eloquence might
                    expatiate, why do we drive it into such confined spaces and into the briary
                    thickets of the Stoics? If I were dealing with a Peripatetic, who would say that
                    we can perceive ' an impression formed from a true object,' without adding the
                    important qualification ' in a manner in which it could not be formed from a
                    false one,' I would meet his frankness with frankness and would not labour to
                    join issue with him, and if, when I said that nothing can be grasped, he said
                    that the wise man sometime; forms an opinion, I would even refrain from
                    combating him, especially as even Carneades does not vehemently combat this
                    position; but as it is what can I do? <note type="margin">113</note> For I put
                    the question what there is that can be grasped; I receive the answer, not from
                    Aristotle or Theophrastus, not even from Xenocrates or Polemo, but from a
                    smaller person,<note type="footnote" n="b" place="opposite">b i.e.,
                        Antiochus.</note> ' A true presentation of such a sort that there cannot be
                    a false one of the same sort.' I do not encounter any such presentation; and
                    accordingly I shall no doubt assent to something not really known, that is, I
                    shall hold an opinion. This both the Peripatetics and the Old Academy grant me,
                    but your school denies it, and Antiochus does so first and foremost, who
                    influences me strongly, either because I loved the man as he </p>

                <p> did me, or because I judge him as the most polished and the most acute of all
                    the philosophers of our time. The first question that I put to him is, how pray
                    can he belong to that Academy to winch he professes to belong? To omit other
                    points, what member of the Old Academy or of the Peripatetic school ever made
                    these two statements that we are dealing with— either that the only thing that
                    can be perceived is a true presentation of such a sort that there could not be a
                    false one of the same sort, or that a wise man never holds an opinion? No one,
                    without a doubt; neither of these propositions was much upheld before Zeno. I
                    nevertheless think both of them true, and I do not say so just to suit the
                    occasion, but it is my deliberate judgement. <note type="margin">Antiochus is

                    whom I both admire and love, and who despises the doctrines of Antiochus that
                    you are putting forward? 'Our doctrines,' you will say, ' are the only true
                    ones.' If they are true, certainly they are the only true ones, for there cannot
                    be several true systems disagreeing with one another. Then is it we that are

                    diagrams proving that the sun is many times as large as the earth, do you think
                    that he will take the oath? If he does, he will have shown contempt for the sun

                    yielded the first place, said that all things are made of water. But in this he
                    did not carry conviction with his fellow-citizen and associate Anaximander;
                    Anaximander said that there exists an infinity of substance<note type="footnote"
                        n="b" place="opposite">b See i. 28 note d.</note> from which the universe
                    was engendered. Afterwards his pupil Anaximenes held that air is infinite, but
                    the things that spring from it finite, and that earth, water and fire are
                    engendered, and then the universe of things out of these. Anaxagoras held that
                    matter is infinite, but that out of it have come minute particles entirely
                    alike, which were at first in a state of medley but were afterwards reduced to
                    order by a divine mind. Xenophanes at a somewhat earlier date said that the
                    universe is one, and that this is unchanging, and is god, and that it never came
                    into being but has existed for ever, of a spherical shape; Parmenides said that
                    the primary element is fire, which imparts motion to the earth that receives
                    from it its conformation; Leucippus's elements were solid matter and empty
                    space; Democritus resembled him in this but was more expansive in the rest of
                    his doctrines; Empedocles taught the four ordinary elements that we know;
                    Heraclitus, fire; Melissus, that the present infinite and unchangeable universe
                    has existed and will exist always. Plato holds the view that the world was made
                    by god out of the all-containing substance, to last for ever. The Pythagoreans
                    hold that the universe originates out of numbers and the first principles of the

                    has left? or that any atoms exist out of which are made things that are all
                    entirely unlike them? or that anything splendid can be produced without the

                    and almost all the other Stoics think the aether a supreme deity, endowed with a
                    mind whereby the universe is ruled, Cleanthes, the Stoic of the older families
                    as it were, who was a disciple of Zeno, holds that the sun is lord and master of
                    the world; thus the disagreement of the wise compels us to be ignorant of our
                    own lord, inasmuch as we do not know whether we are the servants of the sun or
                    of the aether. Then the size of the sun—for this radiant sun himself seems to be
                    gazing at me, reminding me to keep mentioning him —your school then report his
                    size as if you had measured it with a ten-foot rule, while I declare that I
                    mistrust this measurement of yours as I distrust incompetent architects: then is

                    heavens we despise this world of our own as small and even tiny. There is
                    delight in the mere investigation of matters at once of supreme magnitude and
                    also of extreme obscurity; while if a notion comes to us that appears to bear a
                    likeness to the truth, the mind is filled with the most humanizing kind of

                    seem to me to forget that they also lose the guarantee for facts that appear to
                    be more clear. For their assent to or acceptance of the fact that daylight is

                    statue, they will not affirm that it is six feet high with greater positiveness
                    than they will affirm that the sun, which they cannot measure, is more than
                    nineteen times as large as the earth. From this springs the following train of
                    argument: if it cannot be perceived how large the sun is, he that accepts all

                    this provided that they say that everything else can be perceived and grasped in

                    whose founder, as I see it recorded, was Xenophanes whom I mentioned just now;
                    next he was followed by Parmenides and Zeno (and so the school of thought
                    derived from them the name of Eleatic) and afterwards by Euclides, the pupil of

                    their doctrine was that the sole good is that which is always one and alike and
                    the same. These thinkers also took much from Plato. But from Menedemus, who was
                    an Eretrian, they received the designation of the Eretrian school; they placed

                    exist in things intermediate he deemed to be non-existent. Aristo's chief good
                    is in these things to be moved in neither direction—he himself calls it
                        adiaphoria<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a The term is more

                    not even perceive these things with his senses— the name for this
                    unconsciousness is apatheia. Leaving on one side therefore all these numerous
                    opinions, let us now look at the following winch have long been strongly
                    championed. <note type="margin">131</note> Others have held that the end is
                    pleasure; their founder was Aristippus, who had been a pupil of Socrates, and
                    from whom they get the name of the Cyrenaic school; after him came Epicurus,
                    whose doctrine is now more famous, although on the actual subject of pleasure it
                    does not agree with the Cyrenaics. But Callipho defined the end as being
                    pleasure and moral goodness, Hieronymus as freedom from all annoyance, Diodorus
                    the same combined with moral goodness—both the two latter were Peripatetics; but
                    the Old Academy defined the end as living the moral life while enjoying those
                    primary things which nature recommends to man—this is proved by the writings of
                    Polemo, who is very highly approved by Antiochus; and also Aristotle and his
                    adherents seem to come very near Y </p>

                <pb n="639"/>
                <p> to this position. Also Carneades used to put forward the view—not that he held
                    it himself but in order to combat the Stoics with it—that the chief good was to
                    enjoy those things that nature had recommended as primary. Zeno however, who was
                    the originator and first head of the Stoics, set it up that the end of goods is
                    the morally honourable life, and that this is derived from nature's
                    recommendation. <note type="margin">Some Stoic doctrines are challenged by

                    corresponding to all the ends of goods that I have set out there are opposite

                    make that very uneducated and ridiculous answer ' Any body you like, only follow
                    somebody '; no remark could be more ill-considered. I am eager to follow the
                    Stoics: have I permission—I don't say from Aristotle, in my judgement almost the
                    outstanding figure in philosophy, but from Antiochus himself? he was called an
                    Academic, and was in fact, had he made very few modifications, a perfectly
                    genuine Stoic. Well then, the matter will now come to an issue: we must settle
                    on either the Stoic wise man or the wise man of the Old Academy. To take both is
                    impossible, for the dispute between them is not about boundaries but about the
                    whole ownership of the ground, since the entire scheme of life is bound up with
                    the definition of the supreme good, and those who disagree about that disagree
                    about the whole scheme of life. They cannot therefore each of them be the wise
                    man, since they disagree so widely; it must be one or the other. If Polemo's is,
                    the Stoic wise man sins in assenting to a falsehood —for you certainly say that
                    nothing is so alien from the wise man; if on the other hand Zeno's Y 2 </p>

                    and the Peripatetics. Will Antiochus therefore agree with neither? or if not,
                    which of the two, say I, is the wiser? <note type="margin">133</note> What then?
                    when Antiochus himself disagrees in some things from these Stoic friends of his,
                    does he not show that it is impossible for these views to be what the wise man
                    must approve? The Stoics hold that all sins are equal, but with this Antiochus
                    most violently disagrees; do please give me leave to deliberate winch opinion to
                    follow. ' Cut it short,' says he; ' do for once decide on something! ' What of
                    the fact that the arguments advanced seem to me both acute on either side and
                    equally valid? am I not to be careful not to commit a crime? for you, Lucullus,

                    unknown—that is a dogma that I share with you. <note type="margin">134</note>
                    Look at an even much wider disagreement: Zeno thinks that the happy life is
                    placed in virtue alone; what is the view of Antiochus? ' Yes,' says he,' the
                    happy life, but not the happiest.' Zeno was a god, he deemed that virtue lacks
                    nothing: Antiochus is a puny mortal, he thinks that many things besides virtue
                    are some of them dear to man and some even necessary. But I fear that Zeno
                    assigns more to virtue than nature would allow, especially as Theophrastus says
                    a great deal with eloquence and fullness on the opposite side. And as for
                    Theophrastus, I am afraid it is hardly consistent of him both to say that
                    certain evils of body and estate do exist, and yet to hold that a man for whom
                    these are his entire environment will be happy if he is wise. I am dragged in

                    or other is true, virtue is overthrown; but they are at variance on these

                    agree surely cannot be approved by us as true? The doctrine that the mind of the
                    wise man is never moved by desire or elated by joy? well, granted that this may
                    be probable, surely the following tenets are not so too, that he never feels
                    fear and that he never feels pain? would the wise man feel no fear lest his
                    country might be destroyed? no pain if it were? A hard doctrine, although
                    unavoidable for Zeno, who includes nothing in the category of good save moral
                    worth; but not at all unavoidable for you, Antiochus, who think many things good
                    beside moral worth, and many bad beside baseness—things that the wise man is
                    bound to fear when they are coming and to regret when they have come. But I want
                    to know when the Old Academy adopted ' decisions '<note type="footnote" n="a"

                    the wise man does not undergo emotion and perturbation. That school were
                    upholders of the mean in things, and held that in all emotion there was a
                    certain measure that was natural. We have all read the Old Academician Crantor's
                    On Grief, for it is not a large but a golden little volume, and one to be
                    thoroughly studied word by word, as Panaetius enjoins upon Tubero. And the Old
                    Academy indeed used to say that the emotions in question were bestowed by nature
                    upon our minds for actually useful purposes—fear for the sake of exercising
                    caution, pity and sorrow' for the sake of mercy; anger itself they used to say

                    or praetor or general, no one even a police-magistrate, except the wise man, and

                    our friend Carneades, as I said above, is a downright Stoic, though stammering
                    on a very few points. <note type="margin">In fact the contest is between

                    Chrysippus often solemnly avows that from among possible views as to the chief
                    good there are only three that can be defended—a crowd of others he lops off and
                    discards: for he holds that the end is either moral goodness, or pleasure, or a
                    combination of the two; for those who say that the chief good consists in our
                    being free from all trouble are trying (he says) to avoid the unpopular word '
                    pleasure,' but don't get very far away from it, and the same is also the case
                    with those who combine freedom from trouble with moral goodness, nor is it very
                    different with those who to moral goodness join the primary advantages of
                    nature: thus he leaves three opinions that he thinks capable of a probable
                    defence. <note type="margin">139</note> Suppose it is so, although I find it
                    hard to be parted from the Ends of Polemo and the Peripatetics and Antiochus,
                    and hitherto have got nothing more probable—but nevertheless I see how sweetly
                    pleasure flatters our senses. I am slipping into agreeing with Epicurus or else
                    Aristippus: virtue calls me back, or rather plucks me back with her hand; she
                    declares that those are the feelings of the beasts of the field, and </p>

                <pb n="649"/>
                <p> she links the human being with god. A possible line is for me to be neutral, so
                    that, as Aristippus looks only at the body, as if we had no mind, and Zeno takes
                    into consideration only the mind, as if we were without a body, I should follow
                    Calliphon, whose opinion indeed Carneades was constantly defending with so much
                    zeal that he was thought actually to accept it (although Clitomachus used to
                    declare that he had never been able to understand what Carneades did accept);
                    but if I were willing to follow that End, would not truth herself and the
                    -weight of right reason meet me with the reply: ' What, when the essence of
                    morality is to scorn pleasure, will you couple morality with pleasure, like a
                    human being with a beast? ' <note type="margin">140</note>
                    <milestone unit="section" n="46"/> XLVI. There remains therefore one match to be
                    fought off—pleasure versus moral worth: and on this issue Chrysippus, as far as
                    I for my part can perceive, had not much of a struggle. If one should follow the
                    former, many things fall in ruin, and especially fellowship with mankind,
                    affection, friendship, justice and the rest of the virtues, none of which can
                    exist unless they are disinterested, for virtue driven to duty by pleasure as a
                    sort of pay is not virtue at all but a deceptive sham and pretence of virtue.
                    Hear on the opposite side those who say that they do not even understand what
                    the word ' virtue ' means, unless indeed we choose to give the name ' moral ' to
                    what looks well with the mob: that the source of all things good is in the
                    body—this is nature's canon and rule and injunction, to stray away from which
                    will result in a man's never having an object to follow in life. <note

                    hypothetical judgement like ' if day has dawned, it is light,' what a dispute
                    goes on! Diodorus holds one view, Philo another, Chrysippus another. Then, how
                    many points of difference there are between Chrysippus and his teacher
                    Cleanthes? Then, do not two of even the leading dialecticians, Antipater and

                    <note type="margin">144</note> Why then, Lucullus, do you bring me into
                    disfavour, and summon me before a public assembly, so to speak, and actually
                    imitate seditious tribunes and order the shops to be shut? for what is the
                    object of your complaint that we are abolishing the practical sciences, unless
                    it aims at stirring up the craftsmen? But if they all come together from every
                    quarter, it will be easy to stir them on to attack your side! I shall first
                    expound the unpopular doctrine that all the persons then standing in the
                    assembly are on your showing exiles, slaves and madmen; then I shall come to the
                    point that concerns not the multitude but you yourselves now present: according
                    to Zeno and according to Antiochus, you do not know anything! 4 What do you mean
                    by that? ' you will say; ' for what we maintain is that even the unwise man can
                    comprehend many things.' <note type="margin">145</note> But you deny that
                    anybody except the wise man knows anything; and this Zeno used to demonstrate by
                    gesture: for he would display his hand in front of one with the fingers
                    stretched out and say 4 A visual appearance is like this '; next he closed his
                    fingers a little and said, ' An act of assent is like this '; then he pressed
                    his </p>

                <p> fingers closely together and made a fist, and said that that was comprehension
                    (and from this illustration he gave to that process the actual name of
                    catalēpsis, which it had not had before); but then he used to apply his left
                    hand to his right fist and squeeze it tightly and forcibly, and then say that
                    such was knowledge, which was within the power of nobody save the wise man—but
                    who is a wise man or ever has been even they themselves do not usually say. On
                    that showing you, Catulus, at the present moment, do not know that it is
                    daytime, nor do you, Hortensius, know that we are at your country-house! <note
                        type="margin">146</note> Surely these are not less unpopular arguments?
                    though they are not over-neatly put—the ones before were more clearly worked
                    out. But just as you said<note type="footnote" n="a" place="opposite">a See § 22
                        note.</note> that if nothing can be comprehended, the practice of the arts
                    and crafts collapses, and would not grant me that sufficient validity for this
                    purpose is possessed by probability, so now I retort to you that art cannot
                    exist without scientific knowledge. Would Zeuxis or Phidias or Polyclitus endure
                    to admit that they knew nothing, when they possessed such great skill? But if
                    somebody explained to them what power is said to be possessed by knowledge, they
                    would cease to be angry: indeed they would not feel a tinge of resentment even
                    against us after it had been explained to them that we do away with a thing that
                    nowhere exists but left to themselves what is sufficient for them. This theory
                    is also supported by the precaution of our ancestors in requiring every juror to
                    swear to give a verdict ' after the opinion of his own mind,' and afterwards to
                    be held guilty of perjury ' if he gave a false verdict wittingly ' (because much
                    that was unwitting occurred in life), and then </p>

                <p> enacted that a witness giving evidence should say that he ' thought ' even
                    something that he had himself seen, and that the jury giving their verdict on
                    oath should declare not that the facts which they had ascertained ' had occurred
                    ' but that they ' appeared to have.' <note type="margin">Conclusion</note>

                    sailor signalling but even the west wind itself is whispering that it is time
                    for us to be cruising, and also I have said enough; so I ought to round off. On
                    a later occasion however when we engage in these inquiries, let us by preference
                    discuss the wide differences of opinion that exist among the men of greatest
                    eminence, the obscurity of nature and the errors of all these philosophers (who
                    disagree so violently about things good and their opposites<note type="footnote"

                    cannot be more than one truth, a large number of these famous systems must of

                    not sorry," rejoined Lucullus, " that we have debated these subjects; in fact we

                    investigate such questions as we think fit." " Excellent," said I, " but what is
                    Catulus's view? and Hortensius's? " " My view? " replied Catulus; " I am coming
                    round to the view of my father, which indeed he used to say was that of
                    Carneades, and am beginning to think that nothing can be perceived, but to deem
                    that the wise man will assent to something not perceived, that is, will hold an
                    opinion, but with the qualification that he will understand that </p>
