                <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
                <p> TIME has not dealt kindly with Fronto. For more than a millennium and a half his
                    name stood high in the lists of fame. On the strength of ancient testimony he
                    was looked upon as the Cicero of his age; if not indeed his equal, yet as an
                    Isocrates to a Demosthenes. Eumenius,<note type="footnote" n="1">1 Paneg. Const.
                        14: Romanae eloquentiae non secundum sed alteram decus.</note> writing late
                    in the third century, described him as "not the second but the alternative glory
                    of Roman eloquence." A century or more later he is singled out by Macrobius<note
                        type="footnote" n="2">2 Saturnalia, v. 1. He says tenuis quidam et siccus et
                        sobrius amat quandam dicendi frugalitatem, and he ascribes the siccum genus
                        to Fronto, as an orator, no doubt. This was the style of Lysias.</note> as
                    the representative of the plain, precise, matter-of-fact style, contrasted with
                    the copious, in which Cicero is supreme, the laconic, which is the province of
                    Sallust, and the rich and florid, in which Pliny the Younger I and Symmachus
                    luxuriate. Jerome<note type="footnote" n="3">3 Epist. 12: gravitatem
                        Frontonis.</note> about the same time, speaks of the subtleties of
                    Quintilian, the fluency of Cicero, the serious dignity of Fronto, and the smooth
                    periods of Pliny. A little later Claudius Mamertus<note type="footnote" n="4">4
                        Ep. ad Sepandum.</note> recommends Plautus for elegance, Cato for gravitas,
                    Gracchus </p>

                <p> for pungency, Chrysippus for dialectical skill, Cicero for eloquence, and Fronto
                    for splendour (pompa). Sidonius Apollinaris<note type="footnote" n="1">1 Epist.
                        iv. 3.</note> attributes gravitas to Fronto and pondus to Apuleius. Though
                    Fronto's reputation stood so high for 300 years after his death, scarcely a line
                    of his works had survived, as it seemed, to modern times, until in 1815 Cardinal
                    Mai discovered in the Imperial Library at Milan a palimpsest MS. containing many
                    of his letters, the existence of which in classical times had indeed been
                    occasionally intimated, though little was known of their contents. When
                    deciphered the work proved to consist mostly of his educational correspondence
                    with his royal pupils, afterwards the joint Emperors Marcus Antoninus and Lucius
                    Verus. There were included, however, one or two letters between Fronto and their
                    adoptive father, the Emperor Pius, and some, chiefly commendatory, letters to
                    the orator's friends, of whom the only one whose answer is preserved was the
                    historian Appian. Some of the letters are in Greek. In judging this
                    correspondence it should not be forgotten that Fronto disclaims the habit of
                    letter-writing, and declares that no one could be a worse correspondent than
                        himself.<note type="footnote" n="2">2 Ad Amicos, i. 18.</note> It would,
                    therefore, not be fair to estimate Fronto's eminence as an orator from these
                    letters alone, though, of course, they throw light on his </p>

                <pb n="xi"/>
                <p> mind and powers in general, and his theory of rhetorical art in particular. They
                    labour under the limitation of having been mostly written to pupils, and chiefly
                    in connexion with their studies. They are of a private, domestic, and
                    professional nature, and coloured by the relationship between a courtly master
                    and his royal scholars. The early editors of the book, who were disappointed
                    with the nature and contents of the work, had no good word to say for it or its
                    author, but their indignation and contempt were certainly not justified.<note
                        type="footnote" n="1">1 See Hauler, Wien. Stud. (1912), 24. p. 259; Fröhner,

                        favourable view.</note> The volume was well worth recovering, and is here
                    presented to the English reader for the first time. On discovering the MS. in
                    1815, Mai, the librarian of the Ambrosian Library at Milan, lost no time in
                    producing his first edition of it. But the work was done too hastily and
                    carelessly. He also seems to have injured the MS. by a too free use of reagents
                    to bring out the faded characters.<note type="footnote" n="2">2 Hauler, Wien.

                        Klussm. p. 6, seems to differ on this point.</note> Becoming librarian of
                    the Vatican library a few years later, Mai found a second volume containing more
                    leaves of the original Fronto Codex. These he (published with the previous
                    portion in 1823. The Vatican leaves being in better condition than the </p>

                <pb n="xii"/>
                <p> Ambrosian ones, and the editor besides being now more skilful in deciphering the
                    palimpsest, and having taken more pains with his work, the result was more
                    satisfactory. Moreover, the older portion was somewhat improved through a fresh
                    inspection of the MS. by Peter Mazuchelli at Milan, and also because Mai availed
                    himself freely of the critical labours of Niebuhr, Heindorf, and Buttmann on the
                    moiety already published. In their edition of 1816 they had sometimes divined,
                    without seeing the MS., the correct reading, which Mai had missed with it under
                    his eyes. The old Codex of Fronto must have been dismembered and its leaves
                    mixed with others of the same kind before being used for a second writing upon
                    them. For the two volumes of the Acta Concilii of the first Council of
                    Chaleedon, in 451 A.D., in which the Fronto fragments are found, contain besides
                    the Fronto leaves, which are the most numerous, parts of seven speeches of
                    Symmachus, a portion of Pliny's Panegyric, some scholia on Cicero, Moeso-Gothic
                    notes on St. John's Gospel, fragments of a tract on the Arian Controversy, and a
                    single page apiece of Juvenal and Persius. The monks in using the leaves for a
                    second script have generally turned them upside down. When this is not the ease,
                    the writing is more difficult to read. On the first page of both volumes is
                    found the inscription, Liber S. Columbani e Bobio. Bobbio lies in </p>

                <pb n="xiii"/>
                <p> a secluded valley of the Pennine Alps, near the [scene of the battle of the
                    Trebia, where Saint Columban founded a monastery at the beginning of the seventh
                    century, and formed a good library containing not only Latin works in Saxon
                    characters but [many classical authors in their own script, such as Cicero,
                    Juvenal, Persius, and Fronto. The Fronto Codex was, we may suppose, purchased by
                    Columban in Italy. In the same library there was another book of Fronto's,
                    entitled Cornelii Frontonis Elegantiae Latinae, which was extant as late as
                        1494.<note type="footnote" n="1">1 See Raphael Maffaeus Volaterranus, Geogr.
                        iv. ad finem.</note> It was lexicographically arranged. Possibly it was one
                    of the works of Fronto mentioned below. The Vatican volume (No. 5750), contains
                    a Latin version of the Acta of the Council of Chalcedon to [nearly the end of
                    the first session, written about the [tenth century. The volume contained 292
                    leaves of 'which two are missing at the beginning and four at the end. The
                    Ambrosian volume (E. 147) is larger and had 480 pages of which are now wanting
                    twelve at the opening and sixteen at the close. There must have been a third
                    volume of the Acta, somewhat smaller than the others, possibly of about 230
                    pages, the whole work thus comprising with the other two volumes about 1000
                    leaves. The Fronto part of the Vatican volume, as we have it, is 106 leaves, of
                    the Ambrosian, 282. The thirty- </p>

                <pb n="xiv"/>
                <p> four pages missing from these two volumes would probably have contained about
                    twenty Fronto leaves. As the Fronto leaves are more numerous in the Ambrosian
                    volume than in the Vatican according to the proportion 106/286:282/452, it is
                    likely that in the third volume there would have been a corresponding increase
                    of them. The whole might therefore have contained about 580 Fronto leaves. But
                    the quaternion marks, still visible in the margin of the MS., show that there
                    were at least 42½ quaternions or 680 pages, in the original Fronto Codex.<note
                        type="footnote" n="1">1 The speeches of Fronto must have been in a separate
                        Codex, if in the Bobbio library at all.</note> Even if the third volume were
                    forthcoming, we should still be about one-seventh part short of the Fronto
                    Codex. What we have, contains something like four-sevenths of the whole work,
                    but some part of this has not been deciphered, and not a little is obliterated
                    for ever. Dr. Hauler, of Vienna, has been engaged upon the study of the MS. for
                    more than twenty years, and we must wait for the final word on our author until
                    his edition is published. It will certainly revolutionize the text. He has been
                    given unusual facilities by the Italian authorities in his work, and the leaves
                    of the Vatican MS. have been especially washed, cleaned and pressed for the
                    purpose of photographing it in facsimile. As far as possible the new readings
                    which Dr. Hauler has made public in various periodicals have been incorporated
                    in this work, together with </p>

                <p> the important, if rather hastily compiled, notes of a fresh collation of the MS.
                    by the Dutch scholar. Professor Brakman. In spite of Dr. Hauler's keen eyesight
                    and prodigious industry, certain of his restorations do not command complete
                    confidence, especially in cases where we find the other inspectors of the Codex,
                    Mai, du Rieu, and Brakman supporting an entirely different reading. The original
                    Fronto Codex has two columns of writing to each page, each column containing
                    twenty-four lines of fifteen to twenty-one letters each.<note type="footnote"
                        n="1">1 The Fronto leaves in the Vat. volume are numbered 1-4, 13-16, 29,

                    written without accents, the MS. must have been produced before the seventh
                    century, and probably in the sixth. The alterations made by the reviser of the
                    copy show that the copyist was a careless one; nor did the corrector notice all

                    letters in such Subsequent writers as have descended to us. It is certain that
                    Minucius Felix, who was probably a fellow-countryman of Fronto's, knew something
                    of him, for in his Octavius he quotes his declamation against the Christians,

                    or his authority Marius Maximus, probably had an eye on what Fronto says, when
                    he mentions the habit that Marcus had of reading in the theatre, and where he
                    calls him durus. How-lever that may be, it can hardly be doubted that
                        Nazarius<note type="footnote" n="3">3 He speaks of Antoninus, but he means

                    confused way, what Fronto says about the Parthian king and Verus in his
                    Principia Historiae. Symmachus too, another orator of the same century, shews
                    some signs of being acquainted with Fronto. Augustine, himself an African, is
                    supposed in a letter to the Cirtenses to refer to the mention of Polemo by
                        Fronto.<note type="footnote" n="4">4 Epist. 144: et nos ex illis litteris

                <p> Servius, the fifth-century commentator on Vergil, quotes Fronto for one or two
                    usages, but his quotations cannot be identified with any passages in our extant
                    letters. A contemporary grammarian, Charisius,<note type="footnote" n="1">1 See
                        Index. He also quotes from Fronto's speech, Pro, Ptolemaeensibus.</note>
                    however, undoubtedly quotes from Fronto's letters as we have them. P.
                    Consentius, another grammarian of the same period, quotes a sentence referring
                    to Rheims, which may very possibly come from a lost letter to Vietorinus.
                    Niebuhr thought that Sidonius Apollinaris, a learned and eloquent bishop of the
                    fifth century, imitated Fronto here and there. The last author to refer to
                    Fronto was John of Salisbury in the twelfth century. He quotes an obscure remark
                    of his concerning Seneca, that " he was so successful in abolishing error that
                    he seemed almost to create again an age of gold and call down the Gods from
                    heaven to live among men." But Fronto, as we know him, has no word of praise for
                    Seneca. We cannot tell who made and published this collection of letters, but it
                    is impossible to subscribe to the view of Mominsen that it was Fronto
                        himself.<note type="footnote" n="2">2 Hermes, viii. p. 201.</note> Several
                    letters are misplaced: one that was certainly to the Emperor with his answer

                    another are widely separated. </p>

                <p> Mommsen considered that the letters were in the main arranged chronologically,
                    but this can only be allowed with large deductions. For instance, some of the
                    earliest letters come quite at the end of the book. The correspondence with Pius
                    is put after ¦that with his successors. But there is obviously some attempt at
                    systematic arrangement. The Betters that belong to the year of Fronto's
                    consulship 'are grouped together and placed first. In more than one case several
                    letters bearing on a single subject are found placed in juxtaposition in their
                    proper order, as with the letters relating to Herodes.<note type="footnote"
                        n="1">1 See pp. 58 f.</note> In the separate books the letters are arranged,
                    with I obvious exceptions however, in some chronological order; but the letters
                    of a second book, for instance, do not follow those of the first, but begin a
                    new series. The various ailments, also, of Marcus and Fronto are a guide in some
                    cases. Some letters can be dated by means of the speeches of Marcus alluded Ito
                    in them. As for instance the mention of his Caesar speech by Marcus in Ep.
                    Graec. 6 (p. 18) dates this letter as written in 139-140. The speech referred to
                    in Ad M. Caes. iii. 7 (p. 34) is probably a speech of thanks for his first
                    consulship in 140, and the one in v. 1, 2, that for his second consulship in 145
                    or for the Trib. Potestas in 147.<note type="footnote" n="2">2 For further

                <p> The only letters which can be dated to a precise, year, except those which
                    mention Fronto's consulship, are Ad M. Cues. i. 8, written when Mareus was
                    twenty-two, and Ad M. Caes. iv. 13,<note type="footnote" n="1">1 See pp. 37,
                        217.</note> written when he was twenty-four. The latter forms a sort of
                    turning point, not only in the correspondence but also in the life of Marcus. To
                    Fronto's infinite chagrin he broke with rhetoric and betook himself wholly to
                    philosophy, at about the time (147 A.D.) when he became in reality, though not
                    in name, co-emperor. At all events, whether from a slight coolness in their
                    relations or owing to increasing ill-health on the part of Fronto and increasing
                    duties on that of Marcus, the character of the correspondence changes with Book
                    V. Most of the letters are short, some being mere messages, and many of a quite
                    trivial, character. The illnesses and ailments of master and pupil figure
                    largely in them. Fronto's rheumatism, for it was this and not gout, had become
                    chronic by that time. On the accession of Marcus and Lucius the correspondence
                    resumes some of its former character. There are no letters to Lucius earlier
                    than 161, when he became Emperor, but Fronto must have written to him often
                    enough before. But only the later ones were preserved, as the main object of the
                    publication seems to have been to shew Fronto's intimate relations with the
                    Court. We could wish </p>

                <pb n="xxi"/>
                <p> for more correspondence with Pius, but two of Fronto's letters to him are among
                    the best of the series. Fronto became tutor to Marcus after his adoption by
                    Hadrian in 138. None of the letters we have can be dated before 139, when Marcus
                    became Caesar. The marriage of Marcus, which took place most probably in 145,
                    and the various births of his children enable us to give approximate dates to
                    many of the Betters in Book V. The letters Ad Amicos can only be dated with
                    reference to the proconsulships or other governorships of the recipients, many
                    of them being letters commendatory, recommending friends to the notice of the
                    governor of a province. The more important oratorical and historical pieces,
                    with the letters on the Alsian holiday and the death of Fronto's grandson, a
                    characteristic and interesting .piece, fall between 161 and 166, in which year
                    or the next Fronto probably died. Excluding Fronto himself, who could have
                    collected and published the correspondence? The only person in a position to do
                    this seems to be Aufidius Victorinus, the life-long friend of Marcus and
                    Fronto's son-in-law. We have evidence that Fronto kept copies of some of his
                    letters, and Victorinus, as Fronto's heir and one of the leading men in the
                    reign of Commodus, was in a specially favourable position for acting as his
                    father-in-law's literary executor. The object of the compilation was not only to
                    bring into prominence the position of Fronto as </p>

                <pb n="xxii"/>
                <p> Magister and Amicus to the Imperial Brothers, but' also to put on record his
                    views on oratorical and literary style, in fact his whole theory of rhetoric,
                    which there is no reason to think he ever formulated in any special treatise.
                    The letters are valuable not only for what they tell us of Fronto and the light
                    they shed on the literary tendencies of the age, but also for their picture of
                    the young Marcus, whose character and rule will always have an interest for
                    mankind. As Pater has said, these letters recall for us " the long buried
                    fragrance of a famous friendship of the ancient world." We find here a young man
                    and an older one, with a genuine affection for one another, exchanging kindly
                    thoughts on their children, their health, the art of rhetoric, and the ancient
                    writers of their country, while here and there we get a glimpse into the
                    penetralia of the imperial court, or read a page from country life at Lorium or
                    a visit to the seaside.<note type="footnote" n="1">1 For some interesting and

                <p> ALMOST all that we know of Fronto is drawn from the book before us. The probable
                    date of his birth is 100 A.D., and in any case before 113 A.D. He was born at
                    Cirta, now Constantine, in Numidia. This was a Roman colony, and his name being
                    Cornelius, he was doubtless of Roman descent, though he jestingly calls himself
                    " a Libyan of the nomad Libyans." His brother, who is mentioned i several times
                    in the Letters, was named Quadratus.<note type="footnote" n="1">1 See
                        inscription (C.I.L. xv. 7438) on conduit pipes from the Esquiline hill,

                    we are told nothing, but he no doubt studied at Alexandria, for at a later time
                    he had numerous friends there. Fie mentions as his parens and magister the
                    philosopher Athenodotus, but it was not philosophy, which he disliked, that he
                    learnt from him, but an inordinate fondness for similes, or as he calls them,

                    Another master named by him is Dionysius the rhetor, whose fable on The Vine and
                    the Holm-Oak he quotes. He tells us that he took late to the study of Latin
                    literature, in which he afterwards came to be such an adept. </p>

                    patronus, gives us the earlier part of his cursus honorum, from which we learn
                    his father's name Titus, the name of his tribe Quirina, and that he was
                    successively triumvir capitalis, quaestor in Sicily, plebeian aedile, and
                    praetor. The office of quaestor gave him a place in the Senate. In 143, under
                    Pius, he became consul suffectus for July and August, the consul ordinarius for
                    which year was Herodes the eminent Athenian rhetorician, himself like Fronto a
                    tutor to the young princes. Fronto's lesser honour gave occasion for the jesting

                    He was not, however, above flattering his royal pupils on occasion, for he could
                    scarcely have believed himself, when he attributed to Marcus the abilities of
                    the great Julius or to Lucius the military genius of a Marius or a Vespasian.
                    Still at times he could tell Marcus some home truths, and at all events
                    impressed both his charges with his sincerity and love of truth.<note

                    serious attack of illness supervened, and he was obliged to beg off his
                    appointment. His political life being now ended, Fronto devoted his remaining

                <p> and critics of Rome, and regarded as an oracle on linguistic and grammatical
                    questions, and in his letters we find him always inculcating a careful precision
                    in the use of words and a deference to the authority of older writers. How far
                    was his great reputation as orator and pleader justified? Unfortunately we have
                    no specimen, even approximately complete, of his oratory, whether forensic or
                    epideictic, on which to base a verdict. The longest extract extant is from a
                    speech respecting oversea wills, possibly delivered before the Emperor's Court
                    of Appeal. There is besides the well-known fragment of an indictment of the
                        Christians,<note type="footnote" n="1">1 Octavius, ix. It .seems probable
                        that the section immediately preceding this, and describing the "Thyestean

                        think the whole of the anti-Christian polemic of the Octavius is drawn from

                    episode in a speech on behalf of some client. But we do not know how far the
                    writer has given Fronto's words verbatim. The interesting and important letter

                    It was evidently one of his pompaticae orationes. Of other speeches we have a
                    mere mention: the Pro Ptolemaeensibus, from which Charisius preserves a single
                    grammatical form; a speech against Herodes in 142, of which we do not know the
                    title; one Pro Demostrato Petitiano; several in behalf of Saenius Pompeianus and
                    other friends;<note type="footnote" n="3">3 See pp. 232, 238.</note> and
                    speeches on behalf of the Cilicians and Bithynians, the latter in its revised
                    form giving details of his past life, the loss of which is to be regretted.<note

                    famous effort, according to Sidonins Apollinaris, was the speech against Pelops,

                    short summary that we have really no material for judging Fronto's capacity
                    either as advocate in the courts or as orator in the Senate. Dirksen<note

                    juristic competence, but few will believe that he was not perfectly conversant
                    with Roman Law. How otherwise could he have gained his commanding position at
                    the bar in an age which produced such eminent jurists and was </p>

                <pb n="xxviii"/>
                <p> almost the heyday of Roman Law. Not hut that Fronto was, first and foremost, an
                    orator, whose object is not justice but persuasion. It cannot be denied that in
                    the extract from the speech on wills he indulges in fancy pictures and ignores
                    obvious and material facts. Still his presentment of the case is certainly not
                    without point and vigour, though it is over-elaborated and smacks too much of
                    the art of rhetoric. The letters on Matidia's will and the Falcidian Law are in
                    their mutilated condition too ambiguous to assist us in our enquiry as to
                    Fronto's legal attainments. Fronto's ideals in oratory were high. The most
                    difficult test of an orator seemed to him to be that he should please without
                    sacrificing the true principles of eloquence. Smooth phrases for tickling the
                    ears of the hearers must not be such as are offensive to good taste, a
                    feebleness in form being preferable to a coarseness of thought.<note
                        type="footnote" n="1">1 P. 37.</note> In spite of his insistence on style
                    and the choice of words, Fronto knows well enough and affirms that noble
                    thoughts are the essential thing in oratory, for the want of which no verbal
                    dexterity or artistic taste will compensate. It was his deficiency in "high
                    thought's invention" that forced Fronto to concentrate his attention on the form
                    and eke out the matter with the manner. Needless to say he has at his fingers'

                <p> figures and devices of the art of rhetoric, and his knowledge of the Roman
                    language and literature was profound. It has too hastily been assumed that he
                    slighted the great writers of the best age, except Cicero and Sallust, and
                    totally ignored the silver age authors except Lucan and Seneca. But he
                    constantly imitates Terence, recognizes the literary eminence of Caesar and
                    quotes him with approval,<note type="footnote" n="1">1 Aul. Gell. xix. 8.</note>
                    calls Lucretius sublime, quotes him, and ranks him with his prime favourites,
                    quotes Horace, whom he calls memorabilis, more than once, shows an intimate
                    knowledge of Vergil,<note type="footnote" n="2">2 Aul. Gell. ii. 26.</note> and
                    borrows from Livy. He also shows some acquaintance with Quintilian, Tacitus and
                    Juvenal. Fronto has been repeatedly called a pedant, but he was a true lover of
                    his own language and guarded it jealously from unauthorized innovations and
                    ignorant solecisms, His aim seemed to have been to shake the national speech out
                    of the groove into which the excessive and pedantic purism of Cicero, Caesar and
                    their followers had confined it. To do this effectually it was necessary to call
                    in the aid of the great writers of an earlier age, such as Plautus and Ennius
                    and Cato. But this sort of archaism was nothing novel. Thucydides was a thorough
                    archaist, and so was Vergil, and Sallust was eminently one.<note type="footnote"
                        n="3">3 Bacon "spangled his speech with unusual words," and Ben Jonson says

                <pb n="xxx"/>
                <p> effects of the Ciceronian tradition tended more and more to squeeze the life out
                    of the language, the ingrained feeling that "the old is better" gradually spread
                    among the leaders of literary thought. An immense impetus was given to this
                    tendency by the versatile littérateur Hadrian, who openly preferred Ennius to
                    Vergil and Cato to Cicero. But Fronto, fond as he was of old words and ancient
                    locutions, insisted that such must be not only old but more expressive and
                    appropriate than modern ones, or they must not be preferred. He himself
                    confesses that he used only ordinary and commonplace words. No one in his
                    opinion has a right to invent expressions—he calls such words counterfeit coin.
                    He availed himself of old and established words, that were genuine Latin and had
                    all the charm of novelty without being unintelligible, drawing largely on the
                    vocabulary and idiom of Plautus, Ennius, Cato, and Gracchus, and interspersing
                    his familiar letters with quotations from Naevius, Accius, Pacuvius, and
                    Laberius. But this was not an affected or repellent archaism, such as Seneca and
                    Lucian mock at.<note type="footnote" n="1">1 Seneca, lip. 114; Lucian, Demonax,
                        26.</note> Fronto's attitude somewhat resembled that of Rossetti, who
                    declares that " he has been reading early English ballads in search of stunning
                    old words."<note type="footnote" n="2">2 See Brock, Studies in Fronto, p.
                        103n.</note> It is of such words that Fronto is thinking when he speaks of
                    words that must be hunted out with toil and care and watchfulness and </p>

                <p> by the treasuring up of old poems in the memory.<note type="footnote" n="1">1 P.
                        7.</note> He explains that he has in mind the " inevitable " word, for
                    which, if withdrawn, no substitute equally good could be found. Some old words
                    would certainly have no modern equivalent, as for instance in English the word
                    "hansel." "The best words in the best places" would be Fronto's definition of
                    oratory, as it was Coleridge's of poetry. It is a prevalent but mistaken idea
                    that Fronto disparages or underrates Cicero. He may personally prefer Cato or
                    Sallust, but he recognizes the preeminence of Cicero's genius. It is quite
                    possible that if we had the works of the older writers, we also should prefer
                    their simple dignity and natural vigour even to the incomparable finish and
                    opulence of Tully. However that may be, Fronto credits Cicero with almost every
                    conceivable excellence except the due ¦search for the. precise word.<note

                    and abrupter rhythms. For older cadences he substitutes cadences of his own,
                    though he occasionally prides himself on imitating the Tullian mannerisms.<note

                    negligence at the end of sentences; but in epideictic displays everything must

                    perspicuous arrangement counts most with him. This makes his work easy reading.
                    Such difficulties as we find are chiefly due to the mutilated condition of the
                    text in our copy. We have often not only to interpret but to divine what was
                    written. It has been supposed that Fronto set himself purposely to renovate and
                    remodel the language by recalling old words and obsolete idioms,<note
                        type="footnote" n="4">4 cp. Horace, Ars Poet. 70.</note> and by transferring
                    into the literary language colloquialisms from the common speech. But the
                    novella eloculio of which he speaks seems rather to mean a fresher, more
                    vivacious diction, and a more individual form of expression: in fact originality
                    of style. The </p>

                <pb n="xxxiii"/>
                <p> patina of antiquity which he wished to give his work need not necessarily be
                    thought to disfigure it; and his minute accuracy in the use of words is surely
                    more deserving of praise than of blame. He prided himself on distinguishing the
                    nice shades of meaning in allied words, and insisted that his pupil should be
                    exact in his use of words, knowing well that clearness of thought is dependent
                    on definiteness of expression. The extracts from Aulus Gellius given at the end
                    of the book show us the care with which Fronto distinguished the meaning of
                    Words, of which there is further evidence in the De Differentiis
                        Vocabulorum,<note type="footnote" n="1">1 Printed in Mai's edition of
                        Fronto, with another work attributed to Fronto, the Exempla Elocutionum.

                        that he made extracts from Cicero, Ad Anton, ii. 5.</note> if that work is
                    his, as it may well be. It was possibly written for the use of his pupils, that
                    they might not misuse words apparently synonymous, such as the various terms for
                    sight and perception. In this connexion it may be noted that Fronto set great
                    store by the careful use of synonyms, and they abound in his correspondence, but
                    are seldom so colourless as, for instance, our "tied and bound," "let and
                    hinder," many a time and oft" or so run to death as " by leaps and bounds " or "
                    in any shape or form." Eloquence was to Fronto the only thing that mattered in
                    the universe. It was the real sovereign of the human race. Philosophy he
                    disliked and even </p>

                    though he tried loyally to please his master and learn all the tricks of

                    brilliant, he felt pleased, and therefore shunned eloquence. Fronto pertinently
                    rejoined, " You feel pleasure, when eloquent; then, chastise yourself, why
                    chastise eloquence? " Again when Marcus in his ultra-conscientiousness avows a
                    distaste for the obliquities and insincerities of oratory, Fronto is clearly
                    nettled, and counters smartly with a reference to the irony of Socrates. In
                    spite of all Fronto's efforts Marcus in his twenty-fourth year finally declared
                    his decision. He could no longer consent to argue on both sides of a question,
                    as the art of oratory would have him do. There is no doubt that his master was
                    bitterly </p>

                <pb n="xxxv"/>
                <p> disappointed, as he honestly believed he could make a consummate orator of
                    Marcus. A few words require to be said now as to Fronto's method of instruction.
                    He began by taking his pupil through a course of old farces, comedies, ancient
                    orators and poets, and Marcus was encouraged to make extracts from the authors
                    that were read. Cato, Gracchus, Ennius, Sallust, and Cicero were especially
                    studied. The first was Marcus's favourite, but Fronto preferred Sallust before
                    all. In letter-writing Cicero was recognized as supreme, and the " tullian "
                    style of his more familiar letters was looked upon as worthy of imitation.
                    Verse-making was regularly practised as an aid towards oratory. Only hexameters
                    are mentioned in this connexion, and Vergil, who is both archaistic and
                    intensely rhetorical, was no doubt the model. Horace was apparently read but
                    Marcus took a dislike to him.<note type="footnote" n="1">1 P. 140.</note>
                    Similes, or εἰκόνες, formed an important part of Fronto's oratorical armoury. He
                    always had numbers at command on every conceivable subject, some appropriate,
                    and many ingenious, but others far-fetched and out of place. He clearly regarded
                    them as indispensable, and gives elaborate instructions as to their use.<note
                        type="footnote" n="2">2 P. 36.</note> They could scarcely have been of much
                    use in his forensic speeches, one would think. The next step was to use the
                    Commonplaces of </p>

                <pb n="xxxvi"/>
                <p> Theodorus for the manufacture of maxims or -γνῶμαι. One aphorism a day was the
                    allotted task. The object was to strike out some neat epigrammatic sententia,
                    such as are characteristic of Sallust, and to turn the same thought freely and
                    boldly in various ways, often from one language to another. Truth to say, Fronto
                    is himself extraordinarily deficient in sayings of pith and moment. He imitates
                    the panem et Circenses of Juvenal and perhaps the cupido gloriae novissima
                        exuitur<note type="footnote" n="1">1 Tac. Hist. iv. 6, and De Eloqu. i. ad
                        med. below.</note> of Tacitus, but the most striking of his own maxims are
                    noticeable chiefly for their rhythm,s such as pleraque propria venustate
                    carentia gratiam sibimet alienam extrinsecus mutuantur, and longeque praestat
                    secundo gentium rumore iniuriam neglegere quam adverso vindicare. We do not know
                    which maxim of Marcus it was that Fronto declared worthy of Sallust,<note
                        type="footnote" n="2">2 P. 12.</note> but this is a not unsuccessful one:
                    turpe, alioqui fuerit diutius vitium corporis quam animi studium ad reciperandam
                    sanitatem posse durare.<note type="footnote" n="3">3 Ad M. Caes. iv 8</note>
                    Translation from one language to another forms part of the curriculum. Original
                    composition in history was also recommended by Fronto, and Marcus himself seems
                    to have had some aspirations in that direction. Too much stress was laid upon
                    the outward trappings of rhetoric, such as alliteration, oxymoron, antithesis,
                    paronomasia, paraleipsis, and every variety of trope or figure. And in the use
                    of these </p>

                <pb n="xxxvii"/>
                <p> for his rhetorical flights Fronto is ever urging Marcus to "be bold; be bold,
                    and evermore be bold."<note type="footnote" n="1">1 Ennius, see p. 10.</note>
                    Finally came the writing of themes and controversiae, in which the pros and cons
                    of any question, historical or fictitious, are discussed as by a forensic
                    speaker. Whether after all this study Marcus became a really accomplished
                    speaker is not known. We have too little to judge by. But at all events he had
                    mastered thoroughly the principles of the art,<note type="footnote" n="2">2 Dio,
                        lxxi. 35, § 1. He shows his skill in rhetoric even in the Greek of the

                    in his official orations is certain. The Senate, the soldiers, and the people
                    alike heard him with eagerness.<note type="footnote" n="3">3 Ad Anton, i.
                        2.</note> There are several passages in this work where Fronto tries his
                    hand at descriptive narrative, and two in which he essays the role of historian.
                    But his view of history, and how it should be written, was thoroughly mistaken.
                    His eyes are not on the facts, but on the best way to show his rhetorical skill
                    in commonplace or panegyric. His efforts therefore in this direction are useless
                    as history and of no account as literature. The descriptive passages are more
                    successful, the best being the apologue on sleep, translated by Pater in his
                    Marius the Epicurean. A favourable specimen is the mutilated passage referring
                    to Orpheus at the beginning of Ad Marcum, iv. Arion </p>

                    force, but they throw light on his theory of rhetoric. After so long and close
                    an intimacy as these letters reveal we are surprised to find so meagre a mention
                    of Fronto in the gallery of Worthies, from whom he learnt enduring lessons,
                    which Marcus sets at the head of his Thoughts. It is nothing but this: "From
                    Fronto, to note the envy, the subtlety, and the dissimulation, which are
                    habitual to a tyrant; and that as a general rule those amongst us who rank as
                    patricians are somewhat wanting in natural affection."<note type="footnote"

                    and his love for Marcus and Lucius was deep and abiding. We cannot help liking
                    the old man for his honest, kindly disposition, and his loyalty to a high ideal

                <p> for the young pupils who from time to time lived under his roof, and readiness
                    to help them in their careers. He was the centre of a large literary coterie,
                    and his personal friends were devoted to him, while his services as advocate had
                    attached to him many influential friends in the provinces, especially in Cilicia
                    and Africa. Though not really wealthy compared with many other patricians of his
                    time, and very far behind his rival Herodes in this respect, he had by his
                    profession and by taking pupils and also through good management, aided by
                    legacies, gathered a competence sufficient not only for his own wants but for
                    the helping of his friends. He owned one or more villas near Rome and probably
                    estates in Africa. His Horti Maecenatiani on the Esquiline could have been no
                    mean residence, and he was able on one occasion to spend as much as £3000 on new
                    baths there.<note type="footnote" n="1">1 Aul. Gell. xix. 10.</note> The family
                    life of Fronto was a singularly happy one in the mutual affection of its
                    surviving members, though death deprived him of five out of his six children
                    (all daughters) in their infancy. The sole surviving daughter, Gratia, married
                    Aufidius Victorinus, one of the best and most capable men of his age, who
                    afterwards committed suicide under Commodus. One child of this union died, aged
                    three, in Germany, where Victorinus was governor, about </p>

                <p> 165 A.D. One son certainly, and possibly a second, survived to manhood. The
                    former, M. Aufidius Victorinus Fronto, was brought up in Fronto's house and
                    lived to be consul in 199, and in an inscription<note type="footnote" n="1">1
                        Corp. Lisa: Lat. xi. 6334.</note> to his son at Pisaurum recalled his
                    grandfather as " orator, consul, and master of Marcus and Lucius." We hear of an
                    eloquent descendant of Fronto's, Leo by name, in the fifth century at
                        Toulouse.<note type="footnote" n="2">2 Sidon. Apoll. Ep. iv. 21.</note>
                    Mommsen and others have supposed that Fronto lived till the year 175 at least,
                    and possibly longer, because in the De Orationibus he mentions coins of
                    Commodus, but it is necessary to explain the allusion in some other way than as
                    implying the date of Commodus's participation in the Empire. For it is certain
                    that no letter in this correspondence, as we have it, can be dated later than
                    166, and we find Fronto's health getting worse and worse, and the loss of his
                    wife and grandchild in 165 also affected him greatly. There can be little doubt
                    that he predeceased Verus and died in 166 or 167. His grateful pupil Marcus
                    rewarded his love and fidelity with equal affection, and on his death obtained
                    permission from the Senate to set up his statue in the Senate-house and kept his
                    bust among his household gods.<note type="footnote" n="3">3 Capit. Vit. Mar. ii.

                <p> a vogue of a least 300 years, as Sidonius Apollinaris mentions the Frontoniani
                    in an obscure passage.<note type="footnote" n="1">1 Ep. i. 1. " Nor did Jul.
                        Titianus picture Cicero's whole epistolary style in a worthy image (by means
                        of a series of fictitious letters) under the names of noble women. On this
                        account all the Frontonians, as rivals of their fellow-disciple, because he
                        followed the languid (Ciceronian) style of speaking, called him the orators'
                        ape." Here the style of Cicero's letters, which Fronto calls remissior, easy
                        or careless, seems to be disparaged. See Barth, Advers, xlvii. 9, and Nieb.,
                        Introd. to his ed. of Fronto, p. xxiii. The word used by Sidonius is
                        veternosus. How Cicero's style could be called languid or senile
                        (veternosus) is incomprehensible.</note> The great service that Fronto did
                    to his countrymen was to leave their language a freer and more plastic
                    instrument of speech than he found it, by reinforcing it with those elements
                    which were in danger of atrophy for want of use, or were being wasted by being
                    left outside the pale of good literature. Moreover by minute accuracy in the use
                    of words and careful definition of their meaning, he gave precision and clarity
                    to the language, which was a work well worth doing, and deserving of credit. To
                    the reader his style is easy and perspicuous, and far less abnormal and
                    fantastic than that of his fellow African Apuleius. Unfortunately Fronto lacked
                    originality of thought, and his humour is rather heavy, but his fatal foible lay
                    not in his leanings to archaism but in his faith in εἰκόνες, which disfigure
                    even the real pathos of his dirge over the loss of his grandson, and lessen the
                    force of his special pleading for Volumnius of Concordia, though in his </p>

                    comparatio is not ratio. Whether he was proof against the seductive powers of

                    we do not know, but the fragment on overseas wills is not free from this
                    favourite device. One thing seems highly probable, that, if the bulk of Fronto's
                    speeches should ever be recovered, we should form a much higher opinion of his
                    abilities. As it is we can say of him, and this is surely much, that he was vir

                            of Fronto's Actio Gratiarum pro Carthaginiensibus, the whole of which
                            fragment, as far as it is decipherable, is given at the end of the

                            regard et des notes par M. Armand Cassan: 2 vols., Paris, 1830. This is
                            a most disappointing edition.<note type="footnote" n="1">1 A. Pierson,
                                in his edition of Marcus Aurelius, 1843, has reproduced seventy of
                                these letters, with trifling alterations.</note> No improvements are
                            made in the text and the translation evades or omits all the
                            difficulties. But the notes, with their numerous illustrative passages
                            from the older Roman writers, are useful.</item>
                        <item>5. In 1832 the Vatican portion of Mai's Roman edition was published at
                            Zell by Schultz. It had no new features.</item>
                        <item>6. In 1867 S. A. Naber brought out the serviceable edition,' from
                            which everyone has since derived his knowledge of Fronto. Its title was:
                            M. Cornelii Frontonis et M. Aurelii Imperatoris Epistulae: L. Veri et T.
                            Antonini Pii et Appiani Epistularum Reliquiae: post Angelum Maium cum
                            codicibus Ambrosiano et Vatieano iterum contulit G. N. du Rieu:
                            recensuit Samuel Adrianus Naber: Lipsiae, 1867. This was a great
                            improvement on previous editions, the text being based on a fresh
                            inspection of the MS. by du Rieu in 1858. But it left a great deal still
                            to be desired. Owing to certain perverse ideas, especially about the
                            date of Marcus's marriage, the editor went far astray in his chronology
                            of the correspondence. The main indices, taken almost entirely from Mai,
                            are totally inadequate.</item>

                            in 1900, has given us an excellent version of some entire letters and
                            parts of many others.</item>

                            Age, published in 1911, has translated more than thirty letters, mostly
                            in full, with the text opposite. Her rendering gives a very good idea of
                            the original, and the whole book is most helpful to the student of
                            Fronto and his literary claims.</item>

                <p>Besides the above, P. B. Watson, in his Life of Marcus Aurelius, London, 1884,
                    gives versions of several passages from the Correspondence, but he is an unsafe
                    guide as to Fronto's meaning, his knowledge of Latin being inadequate. A more
                    scholarly contribution to the same subject is that of Hastings Crossley in his
                    Fourth Book of the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius, London, 1882, an appendix to
                    which contains a number of select passages from the letters admirably Englished
                    with a running comment. Finally, Robinson Ellis published at Oxford in 1904 a
                    lecture on The Correspondence of Fronto and Marcus Aurelius. It translates a
                    considerable number of passages from various parts of the work with connecting
                    comments.</p>

                <p> THE CORRESPONDENCE OF M. CORNELIUS FRONTO FRONTO TO MARCUS AURELIUS AS CAESAR ?
                    139 A.D. FRONTO to my Lord.<note type="footnote" n="1" place="opposite">1
                        Certainly an early letter, possibly the earliest preserved (see § 4). In a
                        subsequent letter to Marcus, as Emperor, it seems to be referred to as prima
                        illa longiuscula epistula (see<pb n="3"/> Ad Ant. i. 2). Marcus became
                        consul in 140, and this fact could scarcely have been ignored in § 6.</note>
                    <milestone unit="section" n="1"/>1. In all arts, I take it, total inexperience
                    and ignorance are preferable to a semi-experience and a half-knowledge. For he
                    who is conscious that he knows nothing of an art aims at less, and consequently
                    comes less to grief: in fact, diffidence excludes presumption. But when anyone
                    parades a superficial knowledge as mastery of a subject, through false
                    confidence he makes manifold slips. They say, too, that it is better to have
                    kept wholly clear of the teachings of philosophy than to have tasted them
                    superficially and, as the saying goes, with the tips of the lips; and that those
                    turn out the most knavish who, going about the precincts of an art, turn aside
                    or ever they have entered its portals. Yet in other arts it is possible,
                    sometimes, to escape exposure, and for a man to be deemed, for a period,
                    proficient in that wherein he is an ignoramus. But in the choice and arrangement
                    of words he is detected instantly, nor can anyone make a pretence<note
                        type="footnote" n="2">2 The Latin phrase verba dare alicui means " to use
                        mere words to a person," i.e. to deceive him. It is difficult to reproduce

                <p> words for long without himself betraying that he is ignorant of them, that his
                    judgment of them is incorrect, his estimate of them haphazard, his handling Rf
                    them unskilful, and that he can distinguish neither their propriety nor their
                    force. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>2. Wherefore few indeed of our old
                    writers have surrendered themselves to that toil, pursuit, and hazard of seeking
                    out words with especial diligence. M. Porcius alone of the orators of all time,
                    and his constant imitator C. Sallustius, are among these; of poets Plautus
                    especially, and most especially Q. Ennius and his zealous rival L. Coelius, not
                    to omit Naevius and Lucretius, Accius, too, and Caecilius, also Laberius.
                    Besides these, certain other writers are noticeable for choiceness in special
                    spheres, as Novius, Pomponius, and their like, in rustic and jocular and comic
                    words, Atta in women's talk, Sisenna in erotics, Lucilius in the technical
                    language of each art and business. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>3. At this
                    point, perhaps, you will have long been asking in what category I should place
                    M. Tullius, who is hight the head and source of Roman eloquence. I consider him
                    on all occasions to have used the most beautiful words, and to have been
                    magnificent above all other orators in embellishing the subject which he wished
                    to set out. But he seems to me to have been far from disposed to search out
                    words with especial care, whether from greatness of mind, or to escape toil, or
                    from the assurance that what others can scarcely find with careful search would
                    be his at call without the need of searching. And so, from a most attentive
                    perusal of all his writings, I think I have ascertained that he has with the
                    utmost copiousness and opulence handled all </p>

                <pb n="7"/>
                <p> other kinds of words—words literal and figurative, simple and compound and, what
                    are conspicuous everywhere in his writings, noble words, and oftentimes also
                    exquisite ones: and yet in all his speeches you will find very few words indeed
                    that are unexpected and unlooked for, such as are not to be hunted out save with
                    study and care and watchfulness and the treasuring up of old poems in the
                    memory. By an unexpected and unlooked-for word I mean one which is brought out
                    when the hearer or reader is not expecting it or thinking of it, yet so that if
                    you withdrew it and asked the reader himself to think of a substitute, he would
                    be able to find either no other at all or one not so fitted to express the
                    intended meaning. Wherefore I commend you greatly for the care and diligence you
                    shew in digging deep for your word and fitting it to your meaning. But, as I
                    said at first, there lies a great danger in the enterprize lest the word be
                    applied unsuitably or with a want of clearness or a lack of refinement, as by a
                    man of half-knowledge, for it is much better to use common and everyday words
                    than unusual and far-fetched ones, if there is little difference in real
                    meaning. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>4. I hardly know whether it is
                    advisable to shew how great is the difficulty, what scrupulous and anxious care
                    must be taken, in weighing words, for fear the knowledge should check the ardour
                    of the young and weaken their hopes of success. The transposition or subtraction
                    or alteration of a single letter in many cases changes the force and beauty of a
                    word and testifies to the taste or knowledge of the speaker. I may say I have
                    noticed, when you were reading over to me what you had written </p>

                <pb n="9"/>
                <p> and I altered a syllable in a word, that you paid no attention to it and thought
                    it of no great consequence. I should be loth, therefore, for you not to know the
                    immense difference made by one syllable. I should say Os colluere,<note
                        type="footnote" n="1" place="opposite">1 i.e. "to rinse the mouth."</note>
                    but in balneis pavimentum pelluere,<note type="footnote" n="2" place="opposite"
                        >2 i.e. " to swab the flagged floor in the baths."</note> not colluere; I
                    should, however, say laerimis genas lavere,<note type="footnote" n="3"
                        place="opposite">3 " To bathe the cheeks in tears."</note> not pelluere or
                    colluere; but vestimenta lavare,<note type="footnote" n="4">4 " To wash
                        clothes."</note> not lavere; again, sudorem et pulverem abluere,<note
                        type="footnote" n="5">5 "To wash off sweat and dust."</note> not lavare; but
                    it is more elegant to say maculam eluere than abluere; if, however, the stain
                    had soaked in and could not be taken out without some damage, I should use the
                    Plautine word elavere.<note type="footnote" n="6">6 "To scour out."</note> Then
                    there are besides mulsum diluere,<note type="footnote" n="7">7 " To water
                        mead."</note> fauces proluere,<note type="footnote" n="8">8 " To gargle the

                    same word, with the change of a syllable or letter, being used in various ways
                    and meanings; just as, by Hercules, I should speak with a nicer accuracy of a
                    face painted with rouge, a body splashed with mud, a cup smeared with honey, a
                    sword-point dipped in poison, a stake daubed with bird-lime. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="6"/>6. Someone maybe will ask, Who, pray, is to prevent me
                    saying vestimenta lavere rather than lavare, sudorem lavare rather than abluere?
                    As for you, indeed, no one will have any right to interfere with or prescribe
                    for you in that matter, as you are a free man born of free parents, and have
                    more than a knight's income, and are asked your opinion in the Senate; we,
                    however, who have dedicated ourselves in dutiful service to the ears of the
                    cultured must </p>


                <pb n="11"/>
                <p> needs with the utmost care study these nice distinctions and minutiae. Some
                    absolutely work at their words with crowbar and maul as if they were flints;
                    others, however, grave them with burin and mallet as though they were little
                    gems. For you it will be better, for greater deftness in searching out words, to
                    take it to heart when corrected, than to demur or flag when detected in a fault.
                    For if you give up searching you will never find; if you go on searching you
                    will find. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>7. Finally, yon seemed even to have
                    thought it a work of supererogation when I changed your order of a word, so that
                    the epithet three-headed should come before the name Geryon. Bear this, too, in
                    mind: it frequently happens that words in a speech, by a change in their order,
                    become essential or superfluous. I should be right in speaking of a ship with
                    three decks, but ship would be a superfluous addition to three-decker. For there
                    is no danger<note type="footnote" n="1" place="opposite">1 As it happens, it
                        might mean one or two other things in English.</note> of anyone thinking
                    that by three-decker was meant a litter, a landau, or a lute. Then, again, when
                    you were pointing out why the Parthians wore loose wide sleeves, you wrote, I
                    think, to this effect, that the heat was suspended<note type="footnote" n="2">2
                        Used in the sense of supprimo, "checked."</note> by the openings in the
                    robe. Can you tell me, pray, how the heat is suspended? Not that I find fault
                    with you for pushing out somewhat boldly<note type="footnote" n="3">3 cp. below.
                        Ad Caes, ii. 5, Ad Ant. i. 2, ad med.</note> in the metaphorical use of a
                    word, for I agree with Ennius his opinion that "an orator should be bold." By
                    all means let him be bold, as Ennius lays down, but let him in no ease deviate
                    from the meaning which he would express. So I greatly approved and applauded
                    your intention when you </p>

                <pb n="13"/>
                <p> set about seeking for a word; what I found fault with was the want of care shewn
                    in selecting a word which made nonsense. For by openings in sleeves, which we
                    occasionally see to be loose and flowing, heat cannot be suspended: heat can be
                    dispelled through the openings of a robe, it can be thrown off, it can radiate
                    away, it can be given a passage, it can be diverted, it can be ventilated out—it
                    can be almost anything, in fact, rather than be suspended, a word which means
                    that a thing is held up from above, not drawn away through wide passages.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>8. After that I advised you as to the
                    preparatory studies necessary for the writing of history,<note type="footnote"
                        n="1" place="opposite">1 Marcus (see Thoughts, iii. 14) possibly wrote some
                        sort of History of the Greeks and Romans, which Nicephorus<pb n="13"/>
                        Callistus (iii. 31) may perhaps refer to. But Marcus in his Thoughts, i. 17
                        ad fin., disclaims the study of histories.</note> since that was your
                    desire. As that subject would require a somewhat lengthy discussion, I make an
                    end, that I overstep not the bounds of a letter. If you wish to be written to on
                    that subject too, you must remind me again and again. FRONTO TO MARCUS AURELIUS
                    AS CAESAR ? 139 A. D. To my Lord. Gratia<note type="footnote" n="2">2 Gratia was
                        Fronto's wife. He had also a daughter Gratia, who was married about 160, and
                        so probably born between 140 and 145.</note> came home last night. But to me
                    it has been as good as having Gratia, that you have turned your "maxims " so
                    brilliantly; the one which I received to-day almost faultlessly, so that it
                    could be put in a book of Sallust's without jarring or shewing any inferiority.
                    I am happy, merry, hale, in a word become young again, when you make such
                    progress. It is no light thing that I shall require; but </p>

                <p> what I remember to have been of service to myself, I cannot but require of you
                    also. You must turn the same maxim twice or thrice, just as you have done with
                    that little one. And so turn longer ones two or three times diligently, boldly.
                    Whatever you venture on, such are your abilities, you will accomplish: but,
                    indeed, with toil have you coveted a task that is truly toilsome, but fair and
                    honourable and attained by few .... you have got (it) perfectly out. This
                    exercise will be the greatest help to you in speech making; undoubtedly, too,

                    are kind, on your return from Rome I will exact again from you your daily quota

                    with praise. Yet I protest to you by my health, by my mother's and yours, that
                    it was the former letter which gave me the greater pleasure, and that, as I read
                    it, I cried out again and again O happy that I am! Are you then so happy,

                    matter—of speaking the truth—is precisely what is so hard for Gods and men: in

                    something ambiguous or crooked or intricate, whereby the unwary may be I caught
                    and, interpreting the answer in the light of their own wishes, realize its
                    fallaciousness only when the time is past and the business done. But the thing
                    is profitable, and clearly it is the custom to excuse such things merely as
                    pious fraud and delusion. On the other hand, your fault-findings or your guiding

                    not more readily come to my aid, since what I have learnt leaves me in the

                    <milestone unit="section" n="1"/>1. This is the third letter, beloved Boy, that
                    I am sending you on the same theme, the first by the hand of Lysias, the son of
                    Kephalus, the second of Plato, the philosopher,<note type="footnote" n="4">4 He
                        is alluding to the speeches of Lysias and Socrates in Plato's Phaedrus.
                        Philostratus (Ep. 6) sums up the opinions expressed in them thus: τὸ μὲν μὴ
                        ἐρῶντι χαρίζεσθαι, Λυσίου δόξα· τῷ δὲ ἐρῶντι, δοκεῖ Πλάτωνι.</note> and the
                    third, indeed, by the hand of this foreigner, in speech little short of a
                    barbarian, but as regards judgment, as I think, not wholly wanting in sagacity.
                    And I write now without trenching at all upon those previous writings, and so do
                    not you disregard the discourse as saying what has been already said. But if the
                    present treatise seem to you to be longer than those which were previously sent
                    through Lysias and Plato, let this be a proof to you that I can claim in fair
                    words to be at no loss for words. But you must consider now whether my words are
                    no less true than new. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>2. No doubt, O Boy, you
                    will wish to know at the very beginning of my discourse how it is that I, who am
                    not in love, long with such eagerness for the </p>

                <pb n="23"/>
                <p> very same things as lovers. I will tell you, therefore, first of all how this
                    is. He who is ever so much a lover is, by Zeus, gifted with no keener sight than
                    I who am no lover, but I can discern your beauty as well as anyone else, aye,
                    far more accurately, I might say, even than your lover. But, just as we see in
                    the case of fever patients, and those who have taken right good exercise in the
                    gymnasium, the same result proceeds from different causes. They are both
                    thirsty, the one from his malady, the other from his exercise. It has been my
                    lot also to sutler some such malady from love........ <milestone unit="section"
                        n="3"/>3. But me you shall not come near to your ruin, nor associate with me
                    to any detriment, but to your every advantage. For it is rather by non-lovers
                    that beautiful youths are benefited and preserved, just as plants are by waters.
                    For neither fountains nor rivers are in love with plants, but by going near them
                    and flowing past them they make them bloom and thrive. Money given by me you
                    would be right in calling a gift, but given by a lover a quittance. And the
                    children of prophets say that to gods also is the thank-offering among
                    sacrifices more acceptable than the sin-offering, for the one is offered by the
                    prosperous for the preservation and possession of their goods, the other by the
                    wretched for the averting of ills. Let this suffice to be said on what is
                    expedient and beneficial both to you and to him. <milestone unit="section" n="4"
                    />4. But if it is right that he should receive aid from you .... you set this on
                    a firm basis .... you framed this love for him and devised Thessalian
                    love-charms............owing to his insatiable desire .... unless yon have
                    manifestly done wrong. </p>

                    <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>5. And do not ignore the fact that you are
                    yourself wronged and subjected to no small outrage in this, that all men know
                    and speak openly thus of you, that he is your lover; and so, by anticipation and
                    before being guilty of any such things,<note type="footnote" n="1"
                        place="opposite">1 As your relations with him imply.</note> you abide the
                    imputation of being guilty. Consequently the generality of the citizens call you

                    far as I am concerned you shall be called Beautiful,<note type="footnote" n="2"

                    Darling. But if the other use this name as his by right because his desire is
                    greater, let him know that his desire is not greater, but more importunate. Yet
                    with dies and gnats the especial reason why we wave them away and brush them off
                    is because they fly at us most impudently and importunately. It is this, indeed,
                    that makes the wild beast shun the hunter most of all, and the bird the fowler.
                    And, in fact, all animals avoid most those that especially lie in wait for and
                    pursue them. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>6. But if anyone thinks that
                    beauty is more glorified and honoured by reason of its lovers, he is totally
                    mistaken. For you, the beautiful ones, through your lovers, run the risk of your
                    beauty winning no credence with hearers, but through us non-lovers you establish
                    your reputation for beauty on a sure basis. At any rate, if anyone who had never
                    seen you were to enquire after your personal appearance, he would put faith in
                    my praises, knowing that I am not in love; but he would disbelieve the other as
                    praising not truthfully but lovingly. As many, then, as are maimed or ugly or
                    deformed would naturally pray for lovers to be theirs, for they would find no
                    others </p>

                <p> to court them but those who approach them under the madness and duress of love;
                    but you, such is your beauty, cannot reap any greater advantage from a lover.
                    For non-lovers have need of you no less than they. And indeed, to those who are
                    really beautiful, lovers are as useless as flatterers to those who deserve
                    praise. It is sailors and steersmen and captains of warships and merchants, and
                    those that in other ways travel upon it, who give excellence and glory and
                    honour and gain and ornament to the sea—not, heaven help us, dolphins that can
                    live only in the sea: but for beautiful boys it is we who cherish and praise
                    them disinterestedly, not lovers, whose life, deprived of their darlings, would
                    be unlivable. And you will find, if you look into it, that lovers are the cause
                    of the utmost disgrace. But all who are right-minded must shun disgrace, the
                    young most of all, since the evil attaching to them at the beginning of a long
                    life will rest upon them the longer. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>7. As,
                    then, in the case of sacred rites and sacrifices, so also of life, it behooves
                    above all those who are entering upon them to have a care for their good
                    name..................... ................For indeed by such adornments lovers
                    do them no honour, but are themselves guilty of affectation and display, and, as
                    it were, vulgarize the mysteries<note type="footnote" n="1">1 cp. Lucian, De

                    licentious cry, the outcome of stinging lust, such as those of wild beasts and
                    fed cattle, that from sexual desire bellow or neigh or low or howl. Like to
                    these are the lyrics of lovers. If, therefore, you submit yourself to your lover
                    to enjoy where and when he pleases, awaiting neither time that is fitting nor
                    leisure nor privacy, then, like a beast in the frenzy of desire, will he make
                    straight for you and be eager to go to it nothing ashamed. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="8"/>8. I will add but one thing before I conclude my
                    discourse, that we are formed by nature to praise and admire, but not to love,
                    all the gifts of the gods and their works that have come for the use and delight
                    and benefit of men—those indeed of them which are wholly and in every way
                    divine, I mean the earth and sky and sun and sea—while in the case of some other
                    beautiful things of less worth, and formed to fulfil a less comely part, these
                    at once are the subject of envy and love and emulation and desire. And some are
                    in love with wealth, others again with rich viands, and others with wine. In the
                    number and category of such is beauty reckoned by lovers, like wealth and viands
                    and strong drink; but by us, who admire, indeed, but love not, like sun and sky
                    and earth and sea, for such things are too good for any love and beyond its
                    reach. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>9. One thing more will I tell you, and
                    if you will pass it on to all other boys, your words will seem convincing. Very
                    likely you have heard from your mother, or from those who brought you up, that
                    among flowers there is one that is indeed in love with the sun and undergoes the
                    fate of lovers, lifting </p>

                <p> itself up when the sun rises, following his motions as he runs his course, and
                    when he sets, turning itself about; but it takes no advantage thereby, nor yet,
                    for all its love for the sun, does it find him the kinder. Least esteemed, at
                    any rate, of plants and flowers, it is utilized neither for festal banquets nor
                    for garlands of gods or men. Maybe, O Boy, you would like to see this

                    attempts by poets in comedies or Atellane farces. Anyone who practises this kind
                    of composition will choose out an abundance of thoughts and pack them closely
                    and cleverly interweave them, but will not stuff in superfluously many duplicate
                    words, nor forget to round off every sentence concisely and skilfully. It is
                    different with forensic speeches, where we take especial care that many
                    sentences shall end now and again somewhat roughly and clumsily. But here, on
                    the contrary, pains must be taken that there should be nothing left uncouth and
                    disconnected, but that everything, as in a fine robe, should be woven with
                    borders and trimmed with edgings. Finally, as the last lines in an epigram ought
                    to have some sparkle, so the sentence should be closed with some sort of

                    be aimed at is to please. For this kind of discourse is not meant as a speech

                    nor to impassion the multitude, but for pleasantry and amusement. The topic,
                    however, must everywhere be treated as if it were an important and splendid one,
                    and trifling things must be likened and compared to great ones. Finally, the
                    highest merit in this kind of discourse is an attitude of seriousness. Tales of

                    marshal our materials that their order may rest on logical connexion. The fault
                    for which Plato blames Lysias in the Phaedrus, that he has mingled his thoughts
                    in such careless confusion that the first could change places with the last and
                    the last with the first without any loss, is one which we can only escape if we
                    arrange our arguments in classes, and so concatenate them, not in a scattered
                    away and indiscriminately piled together like a dish of mixed ingredients, but
                    so that the preceding thought in some sort overlaps the subsequent one and
                    dovetails into it; that the second thought may begin where the first left off;
                    for so we seem to step rather than jump from one to the other. <milestone

                    man may think negligence to be unsafe and exposed to dangers, but my view is
                    clean contrary, that it is diligence which is much much more liable to perils.
                    For there is not one who takes the trouble to lay traps for negligence, judging
                    that even without a trap it would be easy work to take in a negligent man always
                    and everywhere and at pleasure: against the diligent, however, and the
                    wide-awake and those who watch over their wealth, wiles and deceptions and traps
                    are made ready. So general is it for negligence to be safeguarded by contempt,
                    diligence to be assailed by craft. Mistakes too, committed through negligence
                    are more readily pardoned and for kindnesses so done a more gracious gratitude
                    is felt. For that a man in all other respects neglectful should not have
                    neglected to do a kindness in season is from its unexpectedness grateful.

                    to win from the Gods fulfilment of his prayers, unless I should rather say that,
                    when I pray for you, there is no one who deserves more than you the fulfilment
                    of prayers offered on your behalf. Farewell, most sweet Lord. Greet my Lady. ?

                    Greek tradition foremost as player on the lyre and as dithyrambist, </p>

                <pb n="57"/>
                <p> setting out from Corinth, where he constantly sojourned, in pursuit of gain,
                    after amassing great riches in the coast-towns of Sicily and Italy, prepared to
                    make his way home from Tarentum to Corinth. For his ship's crew he chose
                    Corinthians by preference, and boldly freighted their ship with his immense
                    gains. When the ship was well out at sea he realized that the crew, coveting the
                    wealth which they carried, were plotting his death. He wearied them with prayers
                    to take all his gold for themselves, but leave him his life alone. When that
                    boon was denied him, he was yet granted another grace, in taking farewell of
                    life to sing as much as he would. The pirates put it down as so much to the good
                    that over and above their booty they should hear a consummate artist sing, to
                    whose voice moreover no one should ever thereafter listen. He donned his robe
                    embroidered with gold, and withal his famous lyre. Then he took his stand before
                    the prow in the most open and elevated place, the crew being afterwards
                    intentionally scattered over the rest of the ship. There Arion, exerting all his
                    powers, began to sing, for sea and sky, look you, the last reminder of his
                    skill. His song ended, with a word on his lips he sprang into the sea: a dolphin
                    received him, carried him on his back, outstripped the ship, landed him at
                    Taenarns as near the shore as a dolphin might. <milestone unit="section" n="2"
                    />2. Thence Arion made his way to Corinth, man and robe and lyre and voice all
                    safe; presented himself before Periander, the king of Corinth, who had long
                    known him and esteemed him for his skill; recounted in order what had happened
                    on the ship and subsequently in the sea. The king believed the man but did not
                    know what to think of the miracle, and </p>

                <pb n="59"/>
                <p> waited for the return of ship and crew. When he learnt that they had put into
                    harbour, he gave orders for their being summoned without any excitement;
                    questioned them with a pleasant countenance and gentle words as to whether they
                    had any news of Arion the Lesbian. They answered glibly that they had seen that
                    most fortunate of men at Tarentum making golden profits and applauded by all,
                    his profession being to sing to the lyre; and that his stay was prolonged by
                    reason of his popularity,<note type="footnote" n="1" place="opposite">1 Or
                        possibly " love of his art."</note> his profits, and his praises. As they
                    were saying this, Arion sprang in safe and sound, just as he had stood on the
                    ship's stern with his gold-embroidered robe and his famous lyre. The pirates
                    were dumbfounded at the unexpected sight, nor did they thereafter attempt any
                    denial or disbelief or exculpation. The dolphin's exploit is recorded by a
                    statue set up at Taenarus of a man seated on a dolphin, small in size and
                    executed as a subject-piece rather than as a likeness. ? 140-143 A.D. AURELIUS

                        This and the next four letters refer to a trial at Rome, in which the famous
                        Greek rhetorician, Herodes Atticus, one<pb n="59"/> of Marcus's teachers and
                        his friend, was accused by the Athenians of various crimes. Their principal
                        spokesman was Demostratus, who is mentioned again, Ad Ver. ii. 9. Of the
                        circumstances we only know what the Letters tell us. But a very similar
                        accusation was brought against him nearly thirty years later (see
                        Philostratus, Vit. Soph. p. 242, Kayser). Herodes must have been honourably
                        acquitted on the present occasion, as he was made consul in 143. The trial,
                        one must suppose, preceded the consulship, as he could hardly have been
                        elected to it with such accusations hanging over him.</note> It is a fact
                    that you have often said to me, What can I do to give you the greatest pleasure?

                <p> opportunity. If my love for you admits of any increase, you can increase it now.
                    The trial approaches in which men, it seems, will not only give a generous ear
                    to your eloquence, but turn a grudging eye upon your angry animosity. And I see
                    no one else who can venture to advise you in this matter. For those who are less
                    friendly to you prefer to see you acting inconsistently, while those who are
                    truer friends are afraid of seeming too friendly to your opponent if they divert
                    you from accusing him as you are entitled to do. Then again, if you have conned
                    some especially choice phrase for the occasion, they cannot bear to rob you of
                    its due delivery by an enforced silence. And so, even if you think me an
                    ill-advised counsellor or a forward boy, or too partial to your opponent, I will
                    not, for all that, shew any the more hesitation in pressing upon you what I
                    think the best counsel. But why have I said counsel, whereas it is a favour I
                    claim, urgently claim, from you and, if it is granted, promise to be bound to
                    you in return? But you will say, What! if assailed, shall I not requite in like
                    terms? Nay, you will win by this means greater glory for yourself if, even when
                    assailed, you make no reply.<note type="footnote" n="1">1 Marcus practised what

                    in you and your father all the gains of my life. What could be more friendly,

                    my part believe myself—that in good sense you leave your elders far behind. In
                    fact, in this affair, I realise that your counsel is weighty and worthy of a
                    greybeard, while mine is childish. For what is the good of providing a spectacle
                    for friends and foes? If your Herodes be an honourable and moral man, it is not
                    right that such a man<note type="footnote" n="2">2 We can scarcely keep the
                        assonance: "It is not right that such a wight."</note> should be

                    the truer, that he, whom you count worthy of your patronage, is a virtuous man.
                    Had I had an inkling of the fact, may all the gods plague me if I should ever
                    have ventured to say a word against any friend of yours.<note type="footnote"

                    anything, which does not bear on the case, to damage Herodes, but those facts
                    which do bear on it—and they are undoubtedly of a most savage character—how am I
                    to deal with them? that is the very thing I am in doubt about, and I ask your
                    advice. I shall have to tell of freemen cruelly beaten and robbed, of one even

                        a single payment of 5 minae. However, by deducting from this sum moneys owed
                        by them to his father, he exasperated the citizens against himself, and this
                        may have caused the high-handed proceedings described here. See Philost.

                    business, nor your own standard of self respect. (Let the others conduct the
                    case as they will) and say what they please, since the one thing that greatly
                    concerns me is, that you should say nothing that shall seem unworthy of your
                    character, useless to your case, and to your audience deserving of blame.

                    taken separately, that we may apply the method of Cicero. For when they compress

                    eloquence, who attached to himself numerous followers, from admiration of his
                    virtues and his power of speech, and that he so trained his friends and

                    fierce, the quiet with the violent, the meek with the proud, the sensitive with
                    the cruel. Then all of them gradually put off their ingrained faults, went after
                    virtue and learned righteousness, exchanged shamelessness for a sense of shame,
                    self-will for deference, ill-feeling for kindliness. But if ever anyone by his
                    character had so much influence as to unite his friends and followers in mutual
                    love for one another, you assuredly will accomplish this with far greater ease,

                    attention or done a favour to another, think that this is so much taken from or
                    lost to themselves. Envy among men is a deadly evil and more fatal than any, a
                    curse to enviers and envied alike. Banish it from your circle of friends, and

                    to cheer him up in his illness, your making a sick man more comfortable in

                    dissemble? At any rate, the very fact of your writing me so long a letter, when
                    I was to come to you to-morrow—that, I confess, was to me the most gratifying
                    thing of all; in that did I think myself above all men most blest, for by it you
                    have shewn me in the most marked and the sweetest way how much you make of me,
                    and how great is the confidence you have in my friendship. What shall I say more
                    except I love you deservedly? But why do I say deservedly? Would that I could
                    love you as you deserve! Aye, and that is why I am often full of wrath and
                    indignation against you when away, because you make it impossible for me to love
                    you as I wish, that is, for my soul to follow your love up to its supreme

                    you, and I am doing my best in that quarter, and assuredly he who does not love
                    you neither sees with his eyes nor understands with his heart: of ears I say
                    nothing, for the ears of all hearers have passed under the yoke and are slaves
                    of your voice. To me this day seems, and will seem, longer than a spring day,
                    and the coming night more tedious than a night in winter. For as I desire

                    than others; nay, he is, if you wish the truth, remiss enough. For neither does

                    there should be no reason for your love of me. For that seems to me no love at
                    all which springs from reason and depends on actual and definite causes: by love
                    I understand such as is fortuitous and free and subject to no cause, conceived
                    by impulse rather than by reason, that needs no services, as a fire logs, for
                    its kindling, but glows with self-engendered heat. To me the steaming grottoes
                    of Baiae are better than your bath-furnaces, in which the fire is kindled with
                    cost and smoke, and anon goes out. But the natural heat of the former is at once
                    pure and perpetual, as grateful as it is gratuitous. Just in the same way your
                    rational friendship, kept alight with services, not unfrequently means smoke and
                    watery eyes: relax your efforts for an instant and out they go: but love
                    fortuitous is eternal and enchanting. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>5. Again,

                    their native hills which, springing up self-sown and set without plan and
                    without order, owe nothing to the toil or services of a planter, but are
                    fostered by the wind and the rain. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>6. That love
                    of yours, therefore, unplanted and sprung up without reason, will, I trust, grow
                    steadily on with the cedars and the oaks; whereas if it were cherished by reason
                    of services done, it would not outgrow the myrtles and the bays, which have
                    scent enough but too little strength. In a word, love spontaneous is as superior
                    to love earned by service as fortune is to reason. <milestone unit="section"

                    to conceal and ignore it. Let men doubt, discuss, dispute, guess, puzzle over

                    Alcibiades and the other young men who prided themselves on birth or beauty or

                    gentle persuasion? And yet Socrates assuredly had as much seriousness or force
                    as the cynic Diogenes shewed in his habitual brutality. But he saw, in fact,
                    that the dispositions of men in a measure, and of young men in particular, are
                    more easily won over by courteous and sympathetic than by bitter and
                    unrestrained language. And so he did not attack the errors of youths with
                    mantlets and battering rams, but sapped them with mines, and his hearers never
                    parted from him torn, though sometimes teased. For the race of mankind is by
                    nature stiff-necked against the high-handed, but responds readily to coaxing.

                    awake nearly all night considering with myself whether, maybe from too great
                    partiality for you, I did not think too lightly and indulgently of some
                    shortcoming of yours; whether you should not by now be more trained, more
                    advanced in eloquence, were not your abilities hampered either by sloth or
                    carelessness. Turning these things over anxiously in my mind, I found that you
                    had made much greater progress in eloquence than could be expected from your
                    age, youthful as it is; much greater than the time that you have devoted to
                    these studies would warrant, much greater than the hopes, and those no mean
                    ones, which I had formed of you. But as it came to me only in the dead of night,
                    what a subject you arc writing on! actually one of the epideictic kind,<note
                        type="footnote" n="1" place="opposite">1 The epideictic kind (genus
                        demonstrativum of Quintilian was for show speech, such as panegyrics,
                        speeches of thanks<pb n="105"/> to the Emperor, and μελέται, like the set
                        declamations of the Greek rhetoricians. Quintilian (xii. 58) distinguishes
                        three styles in oratory as (1) subtile, (2) floridum (namque id ὰνθηρὸν
                        appellant) or medium, (3) grande ac robustum; but Gellius (vii. 14) as
                        gracilis, mediocris, uber. The subject here referred to as occupying Marcus,
                        may be the speech mentioned in the next letter.</note> the most difficult of
                    all. Why? Because of all the three generally received kinds of subject, the
                    epideictic, the deliberative, the forensic, the first is set on a steep hill,
                    the others are much less of a climb, being in many respects on sloping or level
                    ground. In short, while there are similarly three types, as it were, of oratory,
                    the plain, the medium, the luxuriant, in epideictic speeches there is
                    practically no place for the plain style, which in forensic </p>

                <pb n="107"/>
                <p> ones is quite essential. In the epideictic speech everything must be said in
                    luxuriant style, everywhere there must be ornament, everywhere trappings must be
                    used. The medium style admits but sparingly of these. <milestone unit="section"

                    present made the acquaintance, comedies, farces, old-time orators, few of whom,
                    perhaps none save Cato and Gracchus, blow a trumpet, but all bellow or, rather,
                    shriek. What, then, has Ennius done for you now you have read him? What help
                    have tragedies been to you in composing verse in the grand style? For generally
                    it is verse that gives the best assistance to composing speeches and speeches to
                    writing verse. You have but lately begun to read florid and showy<note

                    I have not delivered my speech in the Senate. Well, I </p>

                <pb n="111"/>
                <p> have to return thanks to my Lord your Father by proclamation also, and that I
                    shall issue at my Games in the Circus; it will begin with these very words: On
                    the day on which, by the kindness of our great Emperor, I am exhibiting a
                    spectacle most attractive to the people and popular in the highest degree, I
                    have thought it a good opportunity to return thanks to him, that the same day—to
                    be followed by some Ciceronian conclusion. My speech I shall deliver on August
                    13th. You will ask, perhaps, Why so late? Because I am never in a hurry to
                    discharge a solemn duty at the first possible moment, and anyhow. But, as I
                    ought to deal with you without disguise and without circumlocution, I will tell
                    you what is in my mind. I often praised your grandfather, the deified Hadrian,
                    in the Senate, with a steady zeal, aye, and a ready, and those speeches are
                    constantly in everyone's hands. Yet, if your filial feeling towards him will
                    allow me to say so, I wished to appease and propitiate Hadrian, as I might Mars
                    Gradivus or Father Dis, rather than loved him. Why? Because love requires some
                    confidence and intimacy. Since, in my case, confidence was lacking, therefore I
                    dare not love one whom I so greatly revered. Antoninus, however, I love, I
                    cherish like the light, like day, like life, like breath, and feel that I am
                    loved by him. Him I must so praise that my praise be not hidden away in the
                    Journals of the Senate,<note type="footnote" n="1">1 The official record, like

                    other ways; kiss your father, embrace him, lastly, praise him yourself. But you

                    such as you would wish. Farewell, Caesar, and prove worthy of your father, and

                    less energy in loving, will love you more than anyone else loves you, more, in

                    we may have some talk about men also. If you would like to know what I think of
                    him, listen. He seems to me like a hard-working farmer endowed with the utmost

                    rightly, in the following lines:— Would you the marks of mental ill forswear,
                    The scarf spats, lappet, that the rake declare? Be changed, like Polemo, who, in

                    hackneyed and thread-bare subject you can find anything to say that is new and
                    worthy of your abilities. But no doubt the mere wish is an immense help towards
                    what you can do so well. Nothing could be more effective than your thoughts,
                    nothing more complimentary, yet without any sacrifice of good sense, than your
                    expression of them. For I will not be guilty of defrauding you of your
                    legitimate praise for fear of arrogantly praising the praise of myself. You have
                    done your duty pleasingly and in unexceptionable fashion, for which, apart from
                    all question of the subject, you deserve every credit. But as for shewing me
                    your mind, it has not done much in that way, for I knew well enough that you
                    always would put the most favourable construction on every word and act of mine.

                    plead in excuse what will most easily win me pardon. What, then, is this? That
                    in writing the Emperor's encomium I was doing, in the first place, what was
                    especially gratifying to you and your son; in the next I remembered and
                    mentioned both of you in the composition, just as lovers name their darlings
                    over every cup. But, indeed, the craftmanship of similes is an insinuating thing
                    and grows on us. This one, at any rate, has occurred to me, which I add to all
                    the others, and indeed it can most fairly be called a simile (or likeness),
                    being taken from a painter. Protogenes the painter is said to have taken

                    painting nothing but the Ialysus all those eleven years. But, as for me, I
                    painted not one but two Ialysuses at once, being no ordinary ones either of
                    them, nor easy to depict, not only in respect of their faces and figures, but
                    also of their characters and qualities, for the one is the great Imperator of
                    all land and sea, and the other the great Imperator's son, his child in the same
                    way as Athene is of Zeus, but thy son as Hephaestus is of Hera. But let there be
                    no "halting"<note type="footnote" n="2">2 For the lame Hephaestus see Hom. Il.

                    then, would seem to be wholly verisimilous and pieturesque, full as it is in

                    for you know that I do spend time on mere words or mere idiom. And, indeed, it
                    is said that the famous Seythian Anacharsis was by no means perfect in his
                    Attic, but was praised for his meaning and his conceptions. I will compare
                    myself, then, with Anacharsis, not, by heaven, in wisdom, but as being like him
                    a barbarian. For he was a Seythian of the nomad Seythians, and I am a Libyan of
                    the Libyan nomads. I as well as Anacharsis may browse fresh pastures, bleat
                    therefore as well as he while browsing, just as one wills to bleat. See, I have
                    assimilated barbarism to bleating. So will 1 make an end of writing nothing but

                    evils to act with composure is not difficult. For, indeed, in any case to resent
                    an evil, even if it befall unexpectedly, is unseemly for a man who has tasted of
                    education. But it is in joy that I should be more ready to overstep the bounds,
                    for if we are to act unreasonably it is preferable to do so in reference to
                    pleasure than to pain. But you are not even too old<note type="footnote" n="2">2

                    is mean-spirited and his own enemy, much more than Fortune. For Fortune takes
                    away the present reality, but he deprives himself of hope as well. And I will

                    affections. At one time it was Athenodotus the philosopher, at another Dionysius
                    the rhetor<note type="footnote" n="1">1 These two were masters of Fronto; see
                        Index. Marcus (Thoughts, i. 13) mentions Athenodotus.</note> that I loved:
                    and yet, when I reflected that he was preserved to me whom it was my fortune to
                    love, I was less at the mercy of grief and circumstance. But if you as well as I

                    distinguished for virtue and learning and fortune and modesty, you cannot go
                    wrong if you attach yourself to him and set in him all your assurance of good
                    fortune, since as long as he remains to us—for I confess, and make no secret of
                    it, that I am your rival in his love—everything else is remediable and of

                    I have seen you, and why I have not seen you? And perhaps for a few days yet,
                    while you are perforce nursing yourself, I shall not see you. So while you are

                    your feet, my spirits also will stand fast, that are now fevered with the most

                    but containing many antiquities and buildings, and religious ceremonies beyond
                    number. There was not a corner without its chapel or shrine or temple. Many

                    in reading some of Cato's Agriculture and partly in writing not quite such

                    I had a long chat with my little mother as she sat on the bed. My talk was this:
                    What do you think my Fronto is now doing? Then she: And what do you think my

                    father had gone to his bath. So we had supper after we had bathed in the
                    oil-press room; I do not mean bathed in the oil-press room, but when we had
                    bathed, had supper there, and we enjoyed hearing the yokels chaffing one
                    another. After coming back, before I turn over and snore, I get my task done and
                    give my dearest of masters an account of the day's doings, and if I could miss
                    him more, I would not grudge wasting away a little more. Farewell, my Fronto,

                    ? 144-145 A.D. To my Lord. I have been troubled, my Lord, in the night with
                    widespread pains in my shoulder and elbow and knee and ankle. In fact, I have
                    not been able to convey this very news to you in my own writing. FRONTO TO

                    letter, most charmingly expressed, in which you say that the intermission in my
                    letters has caused a longing for them to arise in you. Socrates was right, then,
                    in his opinion that "pleasures are generally linked to pains,'' when in his
                    imprisonment he held that the pain caused by the tightness of his chains was
                    made up for by the pleasure of their removal.<note type="footnote" n="2">2 In

                    This is how I have passed the last few days. My sister<note type="footnote"

                    moment, inadvertently ran her side against a corner of the wall, causing us as
                    well as herself great pain by the accident. For myself, when I went to lie down
                    I came upon a scorpion in my bed<note type="footnote" n="2" place="opposite">2
                        This would be at Lorium, or somewhere in the country.</note>; however, I was

                    more than anything, my master. I have had a bath and to-day even done a little
                    walking and taken a little more food, but not as yet without discomfort.

                    indeed do I wish to be, nor ought I to be, other than distressed. As for me,
                    thanks be to the Gods and your prayers, I have bathed to-day, and taken
                    sufficient food, and wine too I have used with relish. Farewell, my most

                    beginning of your letter! It was written in such a way that I thought some
                    danger to your health was meant. Then, when the danger, which at the beginning
                    of your note I had taken to be yours, was shewn to be your daughter Faustina's,
                    how transformed was my apprehension. Yet not merely transformed, but in some
                    subtle way a little relieved. You may say, Did my daughter's danger seem of less
                    account to you than mine? Could it so seem to you, who protest that " Faustina
                    is to you as a limpid light, as a gala day, as a near and dear hope, as a wish
                    fulfilled, as an unalloyed delight, as a glory noble and assured"? I know,
                    indeed, what came into my mind on reading your letter, but why it came to be so
                    I do not know: I do not know, I say, why I was more shocked at your danger than
                    at your daughter's, unless, perchance, though things be </p>

                <pb n="205"/>
                <p> equally bad, yet those seem worse which are the first to fall on our ears. What
                    is, in fact, the cause of this you are more likely to know, for about the nature
                    and feelings of men your knowledge is somewhat wider than mine, and you have
                    learnt your lesson better. Tolerably well trained as I was by my master and
                    parent Athenodotus in the nice apprehension by the mind and application of
                    illustrations and, as it were, similes of things, which he called εἰκόνας, I
                    think I have hit upon the following simile of this kind, to explain the fact
                    that the I transference of my fear seemed an alleviation of it— that much the
                    same thing happens to those who, carrying a heavy weight on their shoulder,
                    transfer it from the right shoulder to the left, so that, though the burden
                    remains as it was, yet the transference of the pressure seems even a relief.

                    my fear and anxiety by the last part of your letter, in which yon announced that

                    a little easy and unconstrained chat with you on my love for you; for those who
                    are freed from a great fear and apprehension are generally allowed to indulge in
                    a little playfulness and frivolity. I feel how dearly I love you, as much from
                    weighty and serious proofs as also from many trifles. What these trifles are,

                    daughter being put out in consequence, as she is a serious and old-fashioned
                    lady, and when I ask for her hands and feet to kiss, of her drawing them away

                    have spared no pains and earnestly desired to discharge the duties of proconsul.

                    too I called upon eminent citizens to join me, for, owing to my always having
                    advocated the public and private interests of Cilicians before you, I had hosts
                    of friends in that province. From Mauretania also I summoned to my side Julius
                    Senex, a man whose I love for me was no less than mine for him, that I might
                    avail myself not only of his loyalty and diligence, but also of his military

                    the baths in a sedan-chair, they dashed me somewhat carelessly against the
                    scorching entrance to the bath. So my knee was both scraped and scorched:
                    afterwards, too, a swelling came up on the sore place. The doctors advised my
                    keeping in bed. Should you think fit, please also give my Lord your father this

                        familiar than the previous ones to Pius, and this may be evidence of an
                        earlier date. But Fronto had a difficult task to perform, and his letter is

                    say what I could in his excuse. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>2. It cannot be
                    denied that Niger Censorius was unrestrained and ill-advised in his language,
                    but at the same time in many respects he was an honest man and manly and
                    blameless. It will accord with your clemency, Imperator, if you set his other
                    creditable actions against his solitary misconduct in word. <milestone

                    have given up my friendship with him when I realized that he was not held by you
                    in the same favour as before. But, Imperator, I was never of such a spirit as to
                    cast off a friendship formed in prosperity as soon as a whisper of adversity was
                    audible. And in any case—for why should I not say what is in my mind?—I shall

                    and for distress at this dissension. But perhaps I shall have another
                    opportunity of mollifying you and reconciling you to his memory. Meanwhile, lest
                    your ears be open to any attacks by ill-disposed persons on me, I pledge to you
                    my lasting loyalty, which, as I kept it truly and faithfully with Censorius,

                    leaving me heir to five-twelfths of his estate by a will in all other respects
                    unexceptionable but, as far as its language is concerned, ill-advised, since in
                    this he followed the dictates of anger rather than consulted his self-respect.
                    For he inveighed in unmeasured terms against Gavius Maximus, a man of senatorial
                    rank and entitled to my regard. In consequence I have thought it necessary to
                    write to our Lord your Father and to Gavius Maximus himself letters of a very
                    difficult tenor. For, whereas I could not but find fault with the action of my
                    friend Niger, which I myself disapproved of, I wished at the same time, as was
                    right, not to fail in </p>

                    call you away from more important business. ? 157-161 A.D. FRONTO to Antoninus

                        procurators were set over every department of state and of the imperial

                        imperial provinces the procurators were fiscal officers. The procurator a
                        rationibus was the highest of these officials, and corresponded to a

                    long-standing intimacy and almost daily practice of mutual studies. Moreover, I
                    feel certain and would be bold to affirm, that he will shew the same modesty
                    that my friend Calpurnius Julianus has. For it is to enhance his dignity in old
                    age that he desires to attain this distinction, and not from ambition or
                    coveting the salary of a procurator. </p>

                <pb n="265"/>
                <p> When I first made request for Appianus, you gave my petition so kindly a hearing
                    that I had a right to hope. When I renewed my request the next, which was last,
                    year, your answer contained much that was gracious, one thing even in a vein of
                    pleasantry, that the moment you gave Appianus the procuratorship at my request,
                    a flood of pleaders would gush forth asking a like favour. You remember too the
                    native of Greece whom you graciously and smilingly mentioned. But the cases are
                    far from parallel: there is age, there is childlessness, which calls for
                    consolations to relieve it. I would make bold to add that, though both are good
                    men, yet in worth and integrity one has some advantage over the other; and I may
                    say this the more freely, in that I have not named him whom I put second to my

                <p> hours I am not keeping back or putting off, but have written you a few out of my
                    many thoughts. And you, if they are just, give ear and assent to them as just;
                    if they are pedantic, as sincere; but in any case do so to me, as aggrieved and
                    a suppliant. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>2. It is but natural that the
                    individual should take pattern by the community. At any rate we direct our
                    private affairs on the lines of public ones and the law bids us do this. How is
                    it then, that states do not shrink from receiving from the donors, native and
                    alien, offerings and property and money itself, and in some cases even a free
                    gift of their persons, but a friend shrinks from receiving a gift from a friend
                    when he entreats it? And the Gods too by the law of cities accept these gifts
                    from men, as the treasuries of the Gods testify. Aye friends too do not shrink
                    from taking under wills. And why, pray, should a man take under a will, but take
                    nothing from the living, when the latter gift is an even greater proof of
                    affection. For the testator prefers one man to another, but the living donor
                    prefers his friend to himself. And it is sweeter to receive a gift from the
                    living, because it is possible both to acknowledge it to a living person and to
                    make a return. Again a trifling gift<note type="footnote" n="1">1 Martial heads

                    lack of plausible arguments who, in answer to the first of the propositions
                    submitted by you, should object that private conduct ought not to conform to
                    that of states. For we shall find many customs and usages publicly established
                    in cities and privately practised by individuals to be dissimilar. You can
                    easily convince yourself of this by looking at the litigation and disputes
                    between public bodies and individuals, wherein neither the venue of the court
                    nor the number of the judges nor the order of the pleas and summonses nor the
                    allowance of time for the speakers nor the penalties of conviction are the same,
                    but there is </p>

                <pb n="271"/>
                <p> every difference between the public cases and the private. Again the gates of a
                    city must be opened wide for any to enter at will and, when he will, to go out.
                    But for each one of us as individuals, if his doorkeeper guard not his door and
                    be ever on the watch, debarring from ingress those who have no business there,
                    but on the other hand permitting the inmates to go out freely whenever they
                    wish, the safeguarding of the house could not be properly effected. So also
                    porticoes and groves and altars and gymnasia, and baths, if public ones, are
                    thrown open free to all, but if private, are kept under strong lock and key with
                    a door-keeper to boot, and a fee is exacted from the bathers. Nor yet are
                    banquets in private houses and in the Town-Hall the same; nor a horse if it
                    belong to a private person or to the state; nor the purple robe of the
                    magistrate and of the townsman; nor the garland of homegrown roses and the
                    wreath of olive at Olympia. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>2. At the same time
                    I think that I will waive this and concede to you that private conduct must
                    needs conform to public. But conceding this, I would not go further and concede
                    what you would fain persuade me of, that I must conform to it. I will explain
                    what I mean. The point in dispute between us, I take it, was this, whether one
                    ought to accept great and valuable gifts from friends. Justifying this, you
                    pointed to the example of cities accepting great gifts one from another, taking
                    for granted, my dear friend, the very point in dispute. For alleging as I do
                    that individuals ought not to take great gifts from one another, I would say
                    exactly the same of cities, that they ought not to take them either; but you,
                    begging the question </p>

                <pb n="273"/>
                <p> that this is right for cities, adduce it as a proof of what is right for
                    individuals. You must admit that one ought not to prove the question at issue by
                    means of the very points in dispute. But if you say that many states accept such
                    gifts, I will answer that many individuals also accept them, but that the
                    question is whether it is right and fit that they should accept them. And this
                    question beginning with individuals extends to cities also. This point,
                    therefore, I mean the action of cities, you must in all fairness leave on one
                    side, as part of the question in dispute. For I take it you are not unaware that
                    the majority of the most famous and well-ordered cities have never accepted
                    great gifts; as, for example, the City of Rome has rejected many such many a
                    time from very many senders, but Athens exacting heavier gifts than befitted was
                    not at all benefited thereby. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>3. As to your
                    example from the Gods, that they receive gifts and offerings, which you touched
                    on quite briefly, I will endeavour to dismiss it no less shortly. As I am
                    neither God nor the Persian King, it was not fitting even to pay me homage.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>4. The most plausible argument you brought
                    forward, by heaven, was the one from wills—why is it that, when Ave take even
                    large bequests under wills, we should not accept such from the living? The
                    reason is suggested already by yourself. For those who benefit their friends in
                    their wills prefer, as you say, one legatee to another: from them I admit that
                    it is right to take. The living on the other hand prefer, as you say, the
                    friends whom they benefit to themselves. For this very reason I say that what is
                    offered should not be </p>

                <pb n="275"/>
                <p> accepted. For it is in reality no light thing and savours, to tell the truth, of
                    arrogance and tyranny to receive such marks of preference, wherein he, that does
                    another honour, manifestly does himself dishonour, and sets him whom he has
                    honoured above himself. For I would not even mount a horse, if the rider
                    dismounting and going on foot asked me. to ride; nor would I sit down in a
                    theatre, if another gave up his seat to me; nor in wintry weather accept a man's
                    cloak, if by stripping himself and shivering he kept me warmly wrapped. For each
                    man is his own nearer concern and more deserving of honour at his own hands.

                    to the Gods. What, are not these trifling gifts—the little barley-cakes and the
                    honey and the libation-wine and the milk and the organs of the victims? Aye, and
                    the frankincense is a trifling gift to a God. <milestone unit="section" n="6"

                    touching things public and things divine and touching wills. But for myself let
                    me briefly say this: whatever it is shameless and greedy and covetous to ask
                    for, it is no less characteristic of the shameless, the greedy, and the covetous
                    man to accept even from a voluntary giver. To ask for big gifts is shameless,
                    far more to accept them. And it is all one whether we take from a willing or a
                    reluctant giver; for it is not right to ask, but it is not right to take either.
                    Nor should a man accept such gifts as shall leave the sender poorer and render
                    the receiver richer. And great gifts involve both these results. At any rate in
                    the case of a property valuation, you who sent these two </p>

                <p> slaves would declare your property as less and I who received them as more. For
                    the item of these two slaves is no negligible one, either in valuation of goods
                    or in exchange of properties<note type="footnote" n="1">1 At Athens a man, who
                        thought himself unfairly taxed compared with another, could claim a

                        (ἀντιδόσις).</note> or in assessment for taxation or in payment of tribute.

                    no less than he who sends his fellow ball-player too heavy a return or toasts
                    his fellow guest with a big cup. For he would seem to toast him for debauch not
                    for delight. But just as in temperate banquets we see the wine mixed in the
                    proportion of a great deal of water to quite a little wine, so should gifts be a
                    blend of much loving-kindness and very little outlay. For whom can we say that
                    costly gifts befit? The poor? But they cannot send them. The rich? But they do
                    not need them. Moreover, great gifts cannot be given continuously; or, if a man
                    send great gifts and often, he must come to the end of his resources. But small
                    gifts admit of being given continuously and with no compunction, since a man
                    need make but a small acknowledgment to one who has sent a small gift.

                    generosity, but you rob me of praise by constraining me to accept favours. For I
                    too might shew large-heartedness by refusing to accept such. But in small gifts

                    gradually grew up of giving such recommendations in the case of those persons

                    case was not a flagrant one, to the actual judges or their assessors on the
                    bench: not, I take it, to undermine the fairness of the judge or to lead him
                    aside from giving true judgment. But as there had long established itself in the

                    out, witnesses to character to give in all honesty their own private opinion of
                    the defendant, so these commendatory letters seemed to discharge the function of

                    you shew him will be paid with interest. However much distinction Faustinianus
                    gains by your goodwill, the pleasure you derive from his refined nature will be

                    Sallust's or Gracchus's or some poet's, for I need relaxation, and especially of
                    such a kind that the reading of it may uplift me and shake me </p>

                <pb n="303"/>
                <p> free from the cares that beset me; also if you have any extracts from Lucretius
                    or Ennius, sonorous lines if possible, and any that give the impress of
                    character. FRONTO TO MARCUS ANTONINUS 161 A.D. FRONTO to my Lord Antoninus
                    Augustus. Verily, since the creation of mankind and their endowment with speech
                    let me be held the most eloquent of all men, since you, Marcus Aurelius, study
                    my writings and esteem them, and do not think it useless or unprofitable to
                    yourself in the midst of such great affairs to spend your valuable time in
                    reading my speeches. But if it is your love for me which makes you delight even
                    in my abilities, most blest am I in that I am so dear to you as to seem even
                    eloquent in your eyes; or if it is your real judgment and considered opinion
                    that makes you so think, then shall I have every right to seem eloquent to
                    myself since I seem so to you. I am, however, not in the least surprised that
                    you have found pleasure in reading the praises of your father, which I uttered
                    in the Senate when consul designate and again when I had taken up the
                        office.<note type="footnote" n="1">1 In 143. cp. above, p. 113.</note> For
                    you would listen even to the Parthians and Iberians in their own tongue, so they
                    but praised your father, as if they were most consummate orators. It was not my
                    speech you admired but your father's virtues,<note type="footnote" n="2">2 cp.
                        Marcus, Thoughts, i. 16; vi. 30.</note> nor was it the words of the praiser
                    but the deeds of the praised that you praised. </p>

                <pb n="305"/>
                <p> As to my praises of yourself, which I pronounced the same day in the Senate, I
                    would have you look on them in this light, that you then shewed rare natural
                    ability, but now a consummate excellence; that you were then as corn sprouting
                    in a field, but are now as the harvest fully ripe and gathered in the garner.
                    All was hope then, all is having now. Hope has turned to reality. What you asked
                    me, however, to send you, on receiving your letter........men of Attica hard by
                    chewing the cud of their native herbs and the wild thyme of Hymettus .... You
                    could pluck either weighty thoughts from the speeches of the ancients or sweet
                    thoughts from their poems, or splendid thoughts from history, or kindly ones
                    from comedies, or courtly ones from the national drama, or witty and humorous
                    ones from the Atellane farces .... LUCIUS VERUS TO FRONTO 161 A.D. To my master.
                    .... My friend, I mean Calpurnius, and I are naving a dispute, but I shall
                    easily confute him in the presence of all, and with you, too, if you are
                    present, as a witness, that Pylades is superior to his master,<note

                    sweetest and dearest. ? 161 A.D. (? To my Lord.) .... to enquire whether he
                    could see me; when I answered that he could, he procured our friend
                        Tranquillus<note type="footnote" n="1">1 Not Suetonius the writer, who would
                        have been seventy years old by 139 A.D.</note> as his substitute, whom he
                    had also procured as his substitute at dinner. It makes little difference to me,
                    who of the friends you hold dear has an affection for me, except that I take
                    prior account of him who is less disdainful of my friends. I . . . . for he also
                    saw him at once. Tranquillus however found me, when he had a cold, still
                    forbidding but less (positively the use of) grapes........such great .... would
                    arise. How much do I owe to the diligence of Tranquillus, who would never have
                    offered himself for this business, did he not know how much you loved me. FRONTO

                <p> FRONTO TO VOLUMNIUS QUADRATUS. 161 A.D. Our friend Castricius handed me your
                    letter yesterday as I was leaving the baths, and I asked him to come to me for
                    an answer in the morning. During the night I suffered so much from cough and
                    sleeplessness that I was obliged to stay in bed till 11 o'clock. That accounts
                    for my keeping our friend Castricius back. You shall have the books of Cicero
                    corrected and punctuated. Those which I have annotated please keep for your own
                    eye. I will write to you more carefully the reasons why I do not wish them to
                    become public property. FRONTO TO VOLUMNIUS QUADRATUS. 161 A.D. I WILL gladly,
                    my son, read your speech, which you have sent me, and correct anything that
                    seems to require it, but by the hand of my secretary, for my own hand is useless
                    from severe pain. In spite of the pain, however, I have been carried to the
                    circus. For I am again seized with a passion for the games .... be badly
